| **[STI-Bench: Are MLLMs Ready for Precise Spatial-Temporal World Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23765v3)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoNav: Empowering MLLMs with Explicit Geospatial Reasoning Abilities for Language-Goal Aerial Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09587v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-goal aerial navigation is a critical challenge in embodied AI, requiring UAVs to localize targets in complex environments such as urban blocks based on textual specification. Existing methods, often adapted from indoor navigation, struggle to scale due to limited field of view, semantic ambiguity among objects, and lack of structured spatial reasoning. In this work, we propose GeoNav, a geospatially aware multimodal agent to enable long-range navigation. GeoNav operates in three phases-landmark navigation, target search, and precise localization-mimicking human coarse-to-fine spatial strategies. To support such reasoning, it dynamically builds two different types of spatial memory. The first is a global but schematic cognitive map, which fuses prior textual geographic knowledge and embodied visual cues into a top-down, annotated form for fast navigation to the landmark region. The second is a local but delicate scene graph representing hierarchical spatial relationships between blocks, landmarks, and objects, which is used for definite target localization. On top of this structured representation, GeoNav employs a spatially aware, multimodal chain-of-thought prompting mechanism to enable multimodal large language models with efficient and interpretable decision-making across stages. On the CityNav urban navigation benchmark, GeoNav surpasses the current state-of-the-art by up to 12.53% in success rate and significantly improves navigation efficiency, even in hard-level tasks. Ablation studies highlight the importance of each module, showcasing how geospatial representations and coarse-to-fine reasoning enhance UAV navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[WMNav: Integrating Vision-Language Models into World Models for Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02247v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Goal Navigation-requiring an agent to locate a specific object in an unseen environment-remains a core challenge in embodied AI. Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

| **[3DAffordSplat: Efficient Affordance Reasoning with 3D Gaussians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11218v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D affordance reasoning is essential in associating human instructions with the functional regions of 3D objects, facilitating precise, task-oriented manipulations in embodied AI. However, current methods, which predominantly depend on sparse 3D point clouds, exhibit limited generalizability and robustness due to their sensitivity to coordinate variations and the inherent sparsity of the data. By contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers high-fidelity, real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead by representing scenes as dense, continuous distributions. This positions 3DGS as a highly effective approach for capturing fine-grained affordance details and improving recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, its full potential remains largely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance datasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning. This dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances, and 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object categories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce AffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning using 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal structure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align 3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat dataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain, while AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen and unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first large-scale 3D Gaussians Affordance Reasoning Benchmark</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning in visual navigation of end-to-end trained agents: a dynamical systems approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08306v4)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Progress in Embodied AI has made it possible for end-to-end-trained agents to navigate in photo-realistic environments with high-level reasoning and zero-shot or language-conditioned behavior, but benchmarks are still dominated by simulation. In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control. An interactive tool is available at europe.naverlabs.com/research/publications/reasoning-in-visual-navigation-of-end-to-end-trained-agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept Enhancement Engineering: A Lightweight and Efficient Robust Defense Against Jailbreak Attacks in Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13201v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Intelligence (EI) systems integrated with large language models (LLMs) face significant security risks, particularly from jailbreak attacks that manipulate models into generating harmful outputs or executing unsafe physical actions. Traditional defense strategies, such as input filtering and output monitoring, often introduce high computational overhead or interfere with task performance in real-time embodied scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE), a novel defense framework that leverages representation engineering to enhance the safety of embodied LLMs by dynamically steering their internal activations. CEE operates by (1) extracting multilingual safety patterns from model activations, (2) constructing control directions based on safety-aligned concept subspaces, and (3) applying subspace concept rotation to reinforce safe behavior during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that CEE effectively mitigates jailbreak attacks while maintaining task performance, outperforming existing defense methods in both robustness and efficiency. This work contributes a scalable and interpretable safety mechanism for embodied AI, bridging the gap between theoretical representation engineering and practical security applications. Our findings highlight the potential of latent-space interventions as a viable defense paradigm against emerging adversarial threats in physically grounded AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[HUMOTO: A 4D Dataset of Mocap Human Object Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10414v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Human Motions with Objects (HUMOTO), a high-fidelity dataset of human-object interactions for motion generation, computer vision, and robotics applications. Featuring 736 sequences (7,875 seconds at 30 fps), HUMOTO captures interactions with 63 precisely modeled objects and 72 articulated parts. Our innovations include a scene-driven LLM scripting pipeline creating complete, purposeful tasks with natural progression, and a mocap-and-camera recording setup to effectively handle occlusions. Spanning diverse activities from cooking to outdoor picnics, HUMOTO preserves both physical accuracy and logical task flow. Professional artists rigorously clean and verify each sequence, minimizing foot sliding and object penetrations. We also provide benchmarks compared to other datasets. HUMOTO's comprehensive full-body motion and simultaneous multi-object interactions address key data-capturing challenges and provide opportunities to advance realistic human-object interaction modeling across research domains with practical applications in animation, robotics, and embodied AI systems.

| **[Efficient Task-specific Conditional Diffusion Policies: Shortcut Model Acceleration and SO(3) Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09927v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning, particularly Diffusion Policies based methods, has recently gained significant traction in embodied AI as a powerful approach to action policy generation. These models efficiently generate action policies by learning to predict noise. However, conventional Diffusion Policy methods rely on iterative denoising, leading to inefficient inference and slow response times, which hinder real-time robot control. To address these limitations, we propose a Classifier-Free Shortcut Diffusion Policy (CF-SDP) that integrates classifier-free guidance with shortcut-based acceleration, enabling efficient task-specific action generation while significantly improving inference speed. Furthermore, we extend diffusion modeling to the SO(3) manifold in shortcut model, defining the forward and reverse processes in its tangent space with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. This ensures stable and accurate rotational estimation, enhancing the effectiveness of diffusion-based control. Our approach achieves nearly 5x acceleration in diffusion inference compared to DDIM-based Diffusion Policy while maintaining task performance. Evaluations both on the RoboTwin simulation platform and real-world scenarios across various tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 Workshop on 2nd MEIS</p></details> |
| **[FMLGS: Fast Multilevel Language Embedded Gaussians for Part-level Interactive Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08581v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The semantically interactive radiance field has long been a promising backbone for 3D real-world applications, such as embodied AI to achieve scene understanding and manipulation. However, multi-granularity interaction remains a challenging task due to the ambiguity of language and degraded quality when it comes to queries upon object components. In this work, we present FMLGS, an approach that supports part-level open-vocabulary query within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We propose an efficient pipeline for building and querying consistent object- and part-level semantics based on Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). We designed a semantic deviation strategy to solve the problem of language ambiguity among object parts, which interpolates the semantic features of fine-grained targets for enriched information. Once trained, we can query both objects and their describable parts using natural language. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods prove that our method can not only better locate specified part-level targets, but also achieve first-place performance concerning both speed and accuracy, where FMLGS is 98 x faster than LERF, 4 x faster than LangSplat and 2.5 x faster than LEGaussians. Meanwhile, we further integrate FMLGS as a virtual agent that can interactively navigate through 3D scenes, locate targets, and respond to user demands through a chat interface, which demonstrates the potential of our work to be further expanded and applied in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmbodiedEval: Evaluate Multimodal LLMs as Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11858v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant advancements, providing a promising future for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |
| **[MrSteve: Instruction-Following Agents in Minecraft with What-Where-When Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06736v5)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant advances have been made in developing general-purpose embodied AI in environments like Minecraft through the adoption of LLM-augmented hierarchical approaches. While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Functionality understanding and segmentation in 3D scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16310v4)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

| **[SIGHT: Single-Image Conditioned Generation of Hand Trajectories for Hand-Object Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22869v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel task of generating realistic and diverse 3D hand trajectories given a single image of an object, which could be involved in a hand-object interaction scene or pictured by itself. When humans grasp an object, appropriate trajectories naturally form in our minds to use it for specific tasks. Hand-object interaction trajectory priors can greatly benefit applications in robotics, embodied AI, augmented reality and related fields. However, synthesizing realistic and appropriate hand trajectories given a single object or hand-object interaction image is a highly ambiguous task, requiring to correctly identify the object of interest and possibly even the correct interaction among many possible alternatives. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose the SIGHT-Fusion system, consisting of a curated pipeline for extracting visual features of hand-object interaction details from egocentric videos involving object manipulation, and a diffusion-based conditional motion generation model processing the extracted features. We train our method given video data with corresponding hand trajectory annotations, without supervision in the form of action labels. For the evaluation, we establish benchmarks utilizing the first-person FPHAB and HOI4D datasets, testing our method against various baselines and using multiple metrics. We also introduce task simulators for executing the generated hand trajectories and reporting task success rates as an additional metric. Experiments show that our method generates more appropriate and realistic hand trajectories than baselines and presents promising generalization capability on unseen objects. The accuracy of the generated hand trajectories is confirmed in a physics simulation setting, showcasing the authenticity of the created sequences and their applicability in downstream uses.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeGuE: Semantic Guided Exploration for Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03629v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of embodied AI applications has enabled robots to perform complex tasks which require a sophisticated understanding of their environment. To enable successful robot operation in such settings, maps must be constructed so that they include semantic information, in addition to geometric information. In this paper, we address the novel problem of semantic exploration, whereby a mobile robot must autonomously explore an environment to fully map both its structure and the semantic appearance of features. We develop a method based on next-best-view exploration, where potential poses are scored based on the semantic features visible from that pose. We explore two alternative methods for sampling potential views and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulation and physical experiments. Automatic creation of high-quality semantic maps can enable robots to better understand and interact with their environments and enable future embodied AI applications to be more easily deployed.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Decision SpikeFormer: Spike-Driven Transformer for Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03800v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy training solely on pre-collected data, avoiding direct environment interaction - a crucial benefit for energy-constrained embodied AI applications. Although Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)-based methods perform well in offline RL, their high computational and energy demands motivate exploration of more efficient alternatives. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) show promise for such tasks, given their low power consumption. In this work, we introduce DSFormer, the first spike-driven transformer model designed to tackle offline RL via sequence modeling. Unlike existing SNN transformers focused on spatial dimensions for vision tasks, we develop Temporal Spiking Self-Attention (TSSA) and Positional Spiking Self-Attention (PSSA) in DSFormer to capture the temporal and positional dependencies essential for sequence modeling in RL. Additionally, we propose Progressive Threshold-dependent Batch Normalization (PTBN), which combines the benefits of LayerNorm and BatchNorm to preserve temporal dependencies while maintaining the spiking nature of SNNs. Comprehensive results in the D4RL benchmark show DSFormer's superiority over both SNN and ANN counterparts, achieving 78.4% energy savings, highlighting DSFormer's advantages not only in energy efficiency but also in competitive performance. Code and models are public at https://wei-nijuan.github.io/DecisionSpikeFormer.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[3D-Mem: 3D Scene Memory for Embodied Exploration and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17735v5)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing compact and informative 3D scene representations is essential for effective embodied exploration and reasoning, especially in complex environments over extended periods. Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Using the BridgeData V2 dataset, we generate fine-tuned image captions with a pretrained BLIP-2 vision-language model and combine them with visual features through an early fusion strategy. The fused representations are processed using Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agents. Experimental results demonstrate that multimodal agents achieve a 20% improvement in task completion rates and significantly outperform visual-only and textual-only baselines after sufficient training. Compared to transformer-based and recurrent multimodal RL models, our approach achieves superior performance in cumulative reward and caption quality metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L). These results highlight the impact of semantically aligned language cues in enhancing agent learning efficiency and generalization. The proposed framework contributes to the advancement of multimodal reinforcement learning and embodied AI systems in dynamic, real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 14 figures and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[TokenHSI: Unified Synthesis of Physical Human-Scene Interactions through Task Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19901v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing diverse and physically plausible Human-Scene Interactions (HSI) is pivotal for both computer animation and embodied AI. Despite encouraging progress, current methods mainly focus on developing separate controllers, each specialized for a specific interaction task. This significantly hinders the ability to tackle a wide variety of challenging HSI tasks that require the integration of multiple skills, e.g., sitting down while carrying an object. To address this issue, we present TokenHSI, a single, unified transformer-based policy capable of multi-skill unification and flexible adaptation. The key insight is to model the humanoid proprioception as a separate shared token and combine it with distinct task tokens via a masking mechanism. Such a unified policy enables effective knowledge sharing across skills, thereby facilitating the multi-task training. Moreover, our policy architecture supports variable length inputs, enabling flexible adaptation of learned skills to new scenarios. By training additional task tokenizers, we can not only modify the geometries of interaction targets but also coordinate multiple skills to address complex tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve versatility, adaptability, and extensibility in various HSI tasks.

However, current multimodal retrieval tasks lack sufficient complexity and demonstrate limited practical application value. It spires us to design Instance-Driven Multimodal Image Retrieval (IDMR), a novel task that requires models to retrieve images containing the same instance as a query image while matching a text-described scenario. Unlike existing retrieval tasks focused on global image similarity or category-level matching, IDMR demands fine-grained instance-level consistency across diverse contexts. To benchmark this capability, we develop IDMR-bench using real-world object tracking and first-person video data. Addressing the scarcity of training data, we propose a cross-domain synthesis method that creates 557K training samples by cropping objects from standard detection datasets. Our Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based retrieval model, trained on 1.2M samples, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both traditional benchmarks and our zero-shot IDMR-bench. Experimental results demonstrate previous models' limitations in instance-aware retrieval and highlight the potential of MLLM for advanced retrieval applications. The whole training dataset, codes and models, with wide ranges of sizes, are available at https://github.com/BwLiu01/IDMR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Agent Reasoning in Image Schemas: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Embodied Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24110v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in embodied AI, agent reasoning systems still struggle to capture the fundamental conceptual structures that humans naturally use to understand and interact with their environment. To address this, we propose a novel framework that bridges embodied cognition theory and agent systems by leveraging a formal characterization of image schemas, which are defined as recurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. By customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create a neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental conceptual structures. We argue that such an approach enhances both efficiency and interpretability while enabling more intuitive human-agent interactions through shared embodied understanding.</p></details> |  |

Data-driven embodied AI algorithms demand precise, large-scale, human-like manipulation sequences, which are challenging to obtain with conventional reinforcement learning or real-world teleoperation. To address this, we introduce ManipTrans, a novel two-stage method for efficiently transferring human bimanual skills to dexterous robotic hands in simulation. ManipTrans first pre-trains a generalist trajectory imitator to mimic hand motion, then fine-tunes a specific residual module under interaction constraints, enabling efficient learning and accurate execution of complex bimanual tasks. Experiments show that ManipTrans surpasses state-of-the-art methods in success rate, fidelity, and efficiency. Leveraging ManipTrans, we transfer multiple hand-object datasets to robotic hands, creating DexManipNet, a large-scale dataset featuring previously unexplored tasks like pen capping and bottle unscrewing. DexManipNet comprises 3.3K episodes of robotic manipulation and is easily extensible, facilitating further policy training for dexterous hands and enabling real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Graphs as World Models for Semantic Material-Aware Obstacle Handling in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21232v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to infer the material properties of obstacles limits their decision-making capacity. While AVs rely on sensor systems such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar to detect obstacles, this study suggests combining sensors with a knowledge graph (KG)-based world model to improve AVs' comprehension of physical material qualities. Beyond sensor data, AVs can infer qualities such as malleability, density, and elasticity using a semantic KG that depicts the relationships between obstacles and their attributes. Using the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, we evaluated AV performance with and without KG integration. The findings demonstrate that the KG-based method improves obstacle management, which allows AVs to use material qualities to make better decisions about when to change lanes or apply emergency braking. For example, the KG-integrated AV changed lanes for hard impediments like traffic cones and successfully avoided collisions with flexible items such as plastic bags by passing over them. Compared to the control system, the KG framework demonstrated improved responsiveness to obstacles by resolving conflicting sensor data, causing emergency stops for 13.3% more cases. In addition, our method exhibits a 6.6% higher success rate in lane-changing maneuvers in experimental scenarios, particularly for larger, high-impact obstacles. While we focus particularly on autonomous driving, our work demonstrates the potential of KG-based world models to improve decision-making in embodied AI systems and scale to other domains, including robotics, healthcare, and environmental simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Reasoning Video Segmentation with Just-in-Time Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21056v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning segmentation (RS) aims to identify and segment objects of interest based on implicit text queries. As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI agents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring explicit step-by-step guidance. However, current RS approaches rely heavily on the visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs), leading to several major limitations. First, they struggle with queries that require multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex spatial/temporal relationships. Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which may require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs and may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Finally, being primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they scale poorly to online video data. To address these limitations, we propose an agent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS without LLM fine-tuning. Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time digital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- a LLM plans the construction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using specialist vision models. We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin as "just-in-time" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific information and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating every specialist model. The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin representation to identify target objects. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new comprehensive video reasoning segmentation benchmark comprising 200 videos with 895 implicit text queries. The benchmark spans three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal) with three different reasoning chain complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[DINeMo: Learning Neural Mesh Models with no 3D Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20220v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-level 3D/6D pose estimation is a crucial step towards comprehensive 3D scene understanding, which would enable a broad range of applications in robotics and embodied AI. Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the DataPlatter method, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Body Discovery of Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19941v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the pursuit of realizing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the importance of embodied artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly apparent. Following this trend, research integrating robots with AGI has become prominent. As various kinds of embodiments have been designed, adaptability to diverse embodiments will become important to AGI. We introduce a new challenge, termed "Body Discovery of Embodied AI", focusing on tasks of recognizing embodiments and summarizing neural signal functionality. The challenge encompasses the precise definition of an AI body and the intricate task of identifying embodiments in dynamic environments, where conventional approaches often prove inadequate. To address these challenges, we apply causal inference method and evaluate it by developing a simulator tailored for testing algorithms with virtual environments. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical testing, demonstrating their robust performance in various scenarios based on virtual environments.</p></details> |  |

In the context of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), RAG has proven invaluable by augmenting model outputs with supplementary, relevant information, thus improving their quality. Recently, the potential of RAG has extended beyond natural language processing, with emerging methods integrating retrieval-augmented strategies into the computer vision (CV) domain. These approaches aim to address the limitations of relying solely on internal model knowledge by incorporating authoritative external knowledge bases, thereby improving both the understanding and generation capabilities of vision models. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV, focusing on two main areas: (I) visual understanding and (II) visual generation. In the realm of visual understanding, we systematically review tasks ranging from basic image recognition to complex applications such as medical report generation and multimodal question answering. For visual content generation, we examine the application of RAG in tasks related to image, video, and 3D generation. Furthermore, we explore recent advancements in RAG for embodied AI, with a particular focus on applications in planning, task execution, multimodal perception, interaction, and specialized domains. Given that the integration of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV is still in its early stages, we also highlight the key limitations of current approaches and propose future research directions to drive the development of this promising area.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[NavCoT: Boosting LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation via Learning Disentangled Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07376v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and tailored 3D scene understanding designs. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZeroHSI: Zero-Shot 4D Human-Scene Interaction by Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18600v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-scene interaction (HSI) generation is crucial for applications in embodied AI, virtual reality, and robotics. Yet, existing methods cannot synthesize interactions in unseen environments such as in-the-wild scenes or reconstructed scenes, as they rely on paired 3D scenes and captured human motion data for training, which are unavailable for unseen environments. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis, eliminating the need for training on any MoCap data. Our key insight is to distill human-scene interactions from state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/ The first two authors contribute equally</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Training of Generalizable Visuomotor Policies via Control-Aware Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09258v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving generalization is one key challenge in embodied AI, where obtaining large-scale datasets across diverse scenarios is costly. Traditional weak augmentations, such as cropping and flipping, are insufficient for improving a model's performance in new environments. Existing data augmentation methods often disrupt task-relevant information in images, potentially degrading performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EAGLE, an efficient training framework for generalizable visuomotor policies that improves upon existing methods by (1) enhancing generalization by applying augmentation only to control-related regions identified through a self-supervised control-aware mask and (2) improving training stability and efficiency by distilling knowledge from an expert to a visuomotor student policy, which is then deployed to unseen environments without further fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on three domains, including the DMControl Generalization Benchmark, the enhanced Robot Manipulation Distraction Benchmark, and a long-sequential drawer-opening task, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[KARMA: Augmenting Embodied AI Agents with Long-and-short Term Memory Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14908v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI agents responsible for executing interconnected, long-sequence household tasks often face difficulties with in-context memory, leading to inefficiencies and errors in task execution. To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KARMA's plug-and-play capability allows for seamless deployment on real-world robotic systems, such as mobile manipulation platforms.Through this plug-and-play memory system, KARMA significantly enhances the ability of embodied agents to generate coherent and contextually appropriate plans, making the execution of complex household tasks more efficient.

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities, their adaptation to 3D environments (3D-LLMs) remains in its early stages. A primary challenge is a lack of large-scale datasets with dense grounding between language and 3D scenes. We introduce 3D-GRAND, a pioneering large-scale dataset comprising 40,087 household scenes paired with 6.2 million densely-grounded scene-language instructions. Our results show that instruction tuning with 3D-GRAND significantly enhances grounding capabilities and reduces hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. As part of our contributions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark 3D-POPE to systematically evaluate hallucination in 3D-LLMs, enabling fair comparisons of models. Our experiments highlight a scaling effect between dataset size and 3D-LLM performance, emphasizing the importance of large-scale 3D-text datasets for embodied AI research. Our results demonstrate early signals for effective sim-to-real transfer, indicating that models trained on large synthetic data can perform well on real-world 3D scans. Through 3D-GRAND and 3D-POPE, we aim to equip the embodied AI community with resources and insights to lead to more reliable and better-grounded 3D-LLMs. Project website: https://3d-grand.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under revision at IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MoK-RAG, a novel multi-source RAG framework that implements a mixture of knowledge paths enhanced retrieval mechanism through functional partitioning of a large language model (LLM) corpus into distinct sections, enabling retrieval from multiple specialized knowledge paths. Applied to the generation of 3D simulated environments, our proposed MoK-RAG3D enhances this paradigm by partitioning 3D assets into distinct sections and organizing them based on a hierarchical knowledge tree structure. Different from previous methods that only use manual evaluation, we pioneered the introduction of automated evaluation methods for 3D scenes. Both automatic and human evaluations in our experiments demonstrate that MoK-RAG3D can assist Embodied AI agents in generating diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing works share two constraints: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. To bridge the gaps, we propose 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans, and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves.

Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the static to openable (S2O) task which creates interactive articulated 3D objects from static counterparts through openable part detection, motion prediction, and interior geometry completion. We formulate a unified framework to tackle this task, and curate a challenging dataset of openable 3D objects that serves as a test bed for systematic evaluation. Our experiments benchmark methods from prior work, extended and improved methods, and simple yet effective heuristics for the S2O task. We find that turning static 3D objects into interactively openable counterparts is possible but that all methods struggle to generalize to realistic settings of the task, and we highlight promising future work directions. Our work enables efficient creation of interactive 3D objects for robotic manipulation and embodied AI tasks.</p></details> |  |

Many navigation approaches primarily define success by proximity to the target, often overlooking the necessity for optimal positioning that facilitates subsequent manipulation. To address this, we introduce MoMa-Kitchen, a benchmark dataset comprising over 100k samples that provide training data for models to learn optimal final navigation positions for seamless transition to manipulation. Our dataset includes affordance-grounded floor labels collected from diverse kitchen environments, in which robotic mobile manipulators of different models attempt to grasp target objects amidst clutter. Using a fully automated pipeline, we simulate diverse real-world scenarios and generate affordance labels for optimal manipulation positions. Visual data are collected from RGB-D inputs captured by a first-person view camera mounted on the robotic arm, ensuring consistency in viewpoint during data collection. We also develop a lightweight baseline model, NavAff, for navigation affordance grounding that demonstrates promising performance on the MoMa-Kitchen benchmark. Our approach enables models to learn affordance-based final positioning that accommodates different arm types and platform heights, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable integration of navigation and manipulation in embodied AI.

Recognizing continuous video activities poses considerable challenges due to the fast expansion of streaming video, which contains multi-scale and untrimmed activities. We introduce a novel system, CARS, to overcome these issues through adaptive video context modeling. Adaptive video context modeling refers to selectively maintaining activity-related features in temporal and spatial dimensions. CARS has two key designs. The first is an activity spatial feature extraction by eliminating irrelevant visual features while maintaining recognition accuracy. The second is an activity-aware state update introducing dynamic adaptability to better preserve the video context for multi-scale activity recognition. Our CARS runs at speeds $>$30 FPS on typical edge devices and outperforms all baselines by 1.2\% to 79.7\% in accuracy. Moreover, we explore applying CARS to a large video model as a video encoder. Experimental results show that our CARS can result in a 0.46-point enhancement (on a 5-point scale) on the in-distribution video activity dataset, and an improvement ranging from 1.19\% to 4\% on zero-shot video activity datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

To accomplish long-horizon tasks, one of the most feasible ways is to decompose abstract instructions into a sequence of actionable steps. Foundation models still face logical errors and hallucinations in long-horizon planning, unless provided with highly relevant examples to the tasks. However, providing highly relevant examples for any random task is unpractical. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a novel framework for Real-time Long-horizon Embodied Planning. ReLEP can complete a wide range of long-horizon tasks without in-context examples by learning implicit logical inference through fine-tuning. The fine-tuned large vision-language model formulates plans as sequences of skill functions. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. When constructing the dataset, we considered the implicit logical relationships, enabling the model to learn implicit logical relationships and dispel hallucinations. Through comprehensive evaluations across various long-horizon tasks, ReLEP demonstrates high success rates and compliance to execution even on unseen tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

The high cost of commercial mobile manipulation robots significantly limits research in real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose AhaRobot, a low-cost and fully open-source dual-arm mobile manipulation robot system with a hardware cost of only $1,000 (excluding optional computational resources), which is less than 1/15 of the cost of popular mobile robots. The AhaRobot system consists of three components: (1) a novel low-cost hardware architecture primarily composed of off-the-shelf components, (2) an optimized control solution to enhance operational precision integrating dual-motor backlash control and static friction compensation, and (3) a simple remote teleoperation method RoboPilot. We use handles to control the dual arms and pedals for whole-body movement. The teleoperation process is low-burden and easy to operate, much like piloting. RoboPilot is designed for remote data collection in embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboPilot significantly enhances data collection efficiency in complex manipulation tasks, achieving a 30% increase compared to methods using 3D mouse and leader-follower systems. It also excels at completing extremely long-horizon tasks in one go. Furthermore, AhaRobot can be used to learn end-to-end policies and autonomously perform complex manipulation tasks, such as pen insertion and cleaning up the floor. We aim to build an affordable yet powerful platform to promote the development of embodied tasks on real devices, advancing more robust and reliable embodied AI.

Current screen based chat-bots do not take advantage of the the full-suite of natural inputs available in XR, including inward facing sensor data, instead they over-rely on explicit voice or text prompts, sometimes paired with multi-modal data dropped as part of the query. We propose a solution that leverages an attention framework that derives context implicitly from user actions, eye-gaze, and contextual memory within the XR environment. Our work minimizes the need for engineered explicit prompts, fostering grounded and intuitive interactions that glean user insights for the chat-bot.</p></details> |  |

The system leverages multiple RGBD cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Effectiveness of a Socratic Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning Method for Task Planning in Robotics, A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08174v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in reasoning with natural language. Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks. To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenFly: A Versatile Toolchain and Large-scale Benchmark for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents through an environment by leveraging both language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Interactive systems assist humans in these tasks, enabling applications in Embodied AI, human-robot interaction, and virtual reality. However, current methods in hand-object synthesis often neglect dynamics and focus on generating static grasps. The first part of this dissertation introduces dynamic grasp synthesis, where a hand grasps and moves an object to a target pose. We approach this task using physical simulation and reinforcement learning. We then extend this to bimanual manipulation and articulated objects, requiring fine-grained coordination between hands. In the second part of this dissertation, we study human-to-robot handovers. We integrate captured human motion into simulation and introduce a student-teacher framework that adapts to human behavior and transfers from sim to real. To overcome data scarcity, we generate synthetic interactions, increasing training diversity by 100x. Our user study finds no difference between policies trained on synthetic vs. real motions.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |

However, real-world datasets often lack sufficient data for training and evaluation, and synthetic datasets, while larger, lack acoustic realism. Consequently, neither effectively meets practical needs. To address this issue, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit based on the embodied AI simulation platform Habitat-sim, designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim supports multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level adjustments, enabling the creation of more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a benchmark dataset called SonicSet, utilizing LibriSpeech, Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K), Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to investigate the differences between synthetic and real-world data, we selected 5 hours of raw, non-reverberant data from the SonicSet validation set and recorded a real-world speech separation dataset, providing a reference for comparing SonicSet with other synthetic datasets. For speech enhancement, we utilized the real-world dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between SonicSet and existing synthetic datasets. The results indicate that models trained on SonicSet generalize better to real-world scenarios compared to other synthetic datasets. The code is publicly available at https://cslikai.cn/SonicSim/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |

Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 11 figures, manuscript accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |
| **[AffordGrasp: In-Context Affordance Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary Task-Oriented Grasping in Clutter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00778v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring the affordance of an object and grasping it in a task-oriented manner is crucial for robots to successfully complete manipulation tasks. Affordance indicates where and how to grasp an object by taking its functionality into account, serving as the foundation for effective task-oriented grasping. However, current task-oriented methods often depend on extensive training data that is confined to specific tasks and objects, making it difficult to generalize to novel objects and complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce AffordGrasp, a novel open-vocabulary grasping framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) for in-context affordance reasoning. Unlike existing methods that rely on explicit task and object specifications, our approach infers tasks directly from implicit user instructions, enabling more intuitive and seamless human-robot interaction in everyday scenarios. Building on the reasoning outcomes, our framework identifies task-relevant objects and grounds their part-level affordances using a visual grounding module. This allows us to generate task-oriented grasp poses precisely within the affordance regions of the object, ensuring both functional and context-aware robotic manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. We believe our approach advances robotic manipulation techniques and contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://eqcy.github.io/affordgrasp/.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of prior magical grasp implementations at a fraction of the GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping Language-Guided Navigation Learning with Self-Refining Data Flywheel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08467v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating high-quality data for training robust language-instructed agents is a long-lasting challenge in embodied AI. In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |
| **[Towards Robust and Secure Embodied AI: A Survey on Vulnerabilities and Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13175v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, including robots and autonomous vehicles, are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, where they encounter a range of vulnerabilities stemming from both environmental and system-level factors. These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Pattern Recognition Letters.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, when powered by open LLMs, they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a multicomponent memory system. In Minecraft experiments, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks where traditional Voyager fails without GPT-4, collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items and achieving $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones, advancing from basic wood tools to advanced iron equipment. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated collaborative experiences. MindForge advances the democratization of embodied AI development through open-ended social learning, enabling peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.</p></details> |  |

Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |

Central building blocks, perception, planning, communication, and feedback, are then analyzed to illustrate how generative techniques bolster system robustness and flexibility. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the transformative effects of integrating foundation models into embodied, multi-agent frameworks. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions, underlining the significant promise of EMAS to reshape the landscape of AI-driven collaboration.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We propose a novel object-centric latent action learning approach, based on VideoSaur and LAPO, that employs self-supervised decomposition of scenes into object representations and annotates video data with proxy-action labels. This method effectively disentangles causal agent-object interactions from irrelevant background noise and reduces the performance degradation of latent action learning approaches caused by distractors. Our preliminary experiments with the Distracting Control Suite show that latent action pretraining based on object decompositions improve the quality of inferred latent actions by x2.7 and efficiency of downstream fine-tuning with a small set of labeled actions, increasing return by x2.6 on average.</p></details> | Preprint.

| **[POEX: Understanding and Mitigating Policy Executable Jailbreak Attacks against Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16633v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems are rapidly evolving due to the integration of LLMs as planning modules, which transform complex instructions into executable policies. However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

These advancements have led to an explosive increase in the demand for computational power, challenging the limits of Moore's Law. Optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing, faces significant challenges due to its high costs. To address this, various lithography simulators have been developed. However, many of these simulators are limited by their inadequate photoresist modeling capabilities. This paper presents TorchResist, an open-source, differentiable photoresist simulator.TorchResist employs an analytical approach to model the photoresist process, functioning as a white-box system with at most twenty interpretable parameters. Leveraging modern differentiable programming techniques and parallel computing on GPUs, TorchResist enables seamless co-optimization with other tools across multiple related tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that TorchResist achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing solutions.

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |

Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code will be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |

This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions. This highlights the critical need for robust goal specification and safety frameworks before any physical implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected Version - Solved Some Issues with reference compilation by latex</p></details> |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

Nevertheless, the rapid development of MEANETs is accompanied by challenges in trustworthiness and operational efficiency. Fortunately, blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable characteristics, offers promising solutions for MEANETs. However, existing block propagation mechanisms suffer from challenges such as low propagation efficiency and weak security for block propagation, which results in delayed transmission of vehicular messages or vulnerability to malicious tampering, potentially causing severe traffic accidents in blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Moreover, current block propagation strategies cannot effectively adapt to real-time changes of dynamic topology in MEANETs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph Resfusion model-based trustworthy block propagation optimization framework for consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Specifically, we propose an innovative trust calculation mechanism based on the trust cloud model, which comprehensively accounts for randomness and fuzziness in the miner trust evaluation. Furthermore, by leveraging the strengths of graph neural networks and diffusion models, we develop a graph Resfusion model to effectively and adaptively generate the optimal block propagation trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other routing mechanisms in terms of block propagation efficiency and trustworthiness. Additionally, the results highlight its strong adaptability to dynamic environments, making it particularly suitable for rapidly changing MEANETs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</p></details> | Website: GenEx.world |

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

However, a standardized, closed-loop benchmark for evaluating their spatial reasoning and sequential decision-making capabilities is lacking. To address this, we present MetaVQA: a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess and enhance VLMs' understanding of spatial relationships and scene dynamics through Visual Question Answering (VQA) and closed-loop simulations. MetaVQA leverages Set-of-Mark prompting and top-down view ground-truth annotations from nuScenes and Waymo datasets to automatically generate extensive question-answer pairs based on diverse real-world traffic scenarios, ensuring object-centric and context-rich instructions. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with the MetaVQA dataset significantly improves their spatial reasoning and embodied scene comprehension in safety-critical simulations, evident not only in improved VQA accuracies but also in emerging safety-aware driving maneuvers.

However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks. This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context. Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |

The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment.

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |

However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |

Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) requires extensive manual effort for reward function engineering. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) uncovers reward functions from expert demonstrations but relies on an iterative process that is often computationally expensive. Imitation learning (IL) provides a more efficient alternative by directly comparing an agent's actions to expert demonstrations; however, in high-dimensional environments, such direct comparisons often offer insufficient feedback for effective learning. We introduce RILe (Reinforced Imitation Learning), a framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn a dense reward function efficiently and achieve strong performance in high-dimensional tasks. RILe employs a novel trainer-student framework: the trainer learns an adaptive reward function, and the student uses this reward signal to imitate expert behaviors. By dynamically adjusting its guidance as the student evolves, the trainer provides nuanced feedback across different phases of learning. Our framework produces high-performing policies in high-dimensional tasks where direct imitation fails to replicate complex behaviors. We validate RILe in challenging robotic locomotion tasks, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves near-expert performance across multiple settings.</p></details> |  |

Yet current reasoning evaluations of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often rely on text descriptions and allow language-based reasoning shortcuts, failing to measure genuine vision-centric reasoning. To address this, we introduce VisuLogic: a benchmark of 1,000 human-verified problems across six categories (e.g., quantitative shifts, spatial relations, attribute comparisons). These various types of questions can be evaluated to assess the visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs from multiple perspectives. We evaluate leading MLLMs on this benchmark and analyze their results to identify common failure modes. Most models score below 30% accuracy-only slightly above the 25% random baseline and far below the 51.4% achieved by humans-revealing significant gaps in visual reasoning. Furthermore, we provide a supplementary training dataset and a reinforcement-learning baseline to support further progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, data, and baselines are available at https://visulogic-benchmark.github.io/VisuLogic</p></details> |

However, reward hacking issues with PRMs limit their successful application in reinforcement fine-tuning. In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward hacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement learning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future rewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this, we propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation of PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as the minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward hacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more reasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that PRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable reasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps. In contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even at the beginning! Additionally, when we supplement PRM-based fine-tuning with just 10% verifiable rewards, we further alleviate reward hacking and produce the best fine-tuned model based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our experiments, achieving 82.5% accuracy on AMC23 and 53.3% average accuracy across 5 benchmarks. Moreover, we summarize the observed reward hacking cases and analyze the causes of training collapse. Code and models are available at https://github.com/CJReinforce/PURE.</p></details> |  |

Our core idea is to incentivize a reasoning-based meta-agent via external execution feedback. Concretely, by distilling DeepSeek R1, we first endow the basic reasoning ability regarding the generation of multi-agent systems to FlowReasoner. Then, we further enhance it via reinforcement learning (RL) with external execution feedback. A multi-purpose reward is designed to guide the RL training from aspects of performance, complexity, and efficiency. In this manner, FlowReasoner is enabled to generate a personalized multi-agent system for each user query via deliberative reasoning. Experiments on both engineering and competition code benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of FlowReasoner. Remarkably, it surpasses o1-mini by 10.52% accuracy across three benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/FlowReasoner.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, reinforcement learning policies are typically encoded in either opaque systems like neural networks or symbolic systems that rely on predefined symbols and rules. This disjointed approach severely limits the agents' capabilities, as they often lack either the flexible low-level reaction characteristic of neural agents or the interpretable reasoning of symbolic agents. To overcome this challenge, we introduce BlendRL, a neuro-symbolic RL framework that harmoniously integrates both paradigms within RL agents that use mixtures of both logic and neural policies. We empirically demonstrate that BlendRL agents outperform both neural and symbolic baselines in standard Atari environments, and showcase their robustness to environmental changes. Additionally, we analyze the interaction between neural and symbolic policies, illustrating how their hybrid use helps agents overcome each other's limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[DRAGON: Distributional Rewards Optimize Diffusion Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15217v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Distributional RewArds for Generative OptimizatioN (DRAGON), a versatile framework for fine-tuning media generation models towards a desired outcome. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization (DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate either individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with a broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and distribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct novel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples to create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP are used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text versus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores them to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and leverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For evaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20 different reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP score, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare instance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple FAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an 81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets indeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality win rate without training on human preference annotations. As such, DRAGON exhibits a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for improving human-perceived quality. Sound examples at https://ml-dragon.github.io/web.</p></details> |  |

This paper aims to investigate the fine-tuning of code-generating LLMs using Reinforcement Learning and Direct Preference Optimization, further improving their performance. To achieve this, we enhance the training data for the reward model with the help of symbolic execution techniques, ensuring more comprehensive and objective data. With symbolic execution, we create a custom dataset that better captures the nuances in code evaluation. Our reward models, fine-tuned on this dataset, demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline, CodeRL, in estimating the quality of generated code. Our code-generating LLMs, trained with the help of reward model feedback, achieve similar results compared to the CodeRL benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Binary Opinions: A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Approach to Uncertainty-Aware Competitive Influence Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15131v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Competitive Influence Maximization (CIM) problem involves multiple entities competing for influence in online social networks (OSNs). While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise, existing methods often assume users' opinions are binary and ignore their behavior and prior knowledge. We propose DRIM, a multi-dimensional uncertainty-aware DRL-based CIM framework that leverages Subjective Logic (SL) to model uncertainty in user opinions, preferences, and DRL decision-making. DRIM introduces an Uncertainty-based Opinion Model (UOM) for a more realistic representation of user uncertainty and optimizes seed selection for propagating true information while countering false information. In addition, it quantifies uncertainty in balancing exploration and exploitation. Results show that UOM significantly enhances true information spread and maintains influence against advanced false information strategies. DRIM-based CIM schemes outperform state-of-the-art methods by up to 57% and 88% in influence while being up to 48% and 77% faster. Sensitivity analysis indicates that higher network observability and greater information propagation boost performance, while high network activity mitigates the effect of users' initial biases.</p></details> |  |
| **[A General Infrastructure and Workflow for Quadrotor Deep Reinforcement Learning and Reality Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15129v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying robot learning methods to a quadrotor in unstructured outdoor environments is an exciting task. Quadrotors operating in real-world environments by learning-based methods encounter several challenges: a large amount of simulator generated data required for training, strict demands for real-time processing onboard, and the sim-to-real gap caused by dynamic and noisy conditions. Current works have made a great breakthrough in applying learning-based methods to end-to-end control of quadrotors, but rarely mention the infrastructure system training from scratch and deploying to reality, which makes it difficult to reproduce methods and applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a platform that enables the seamless transfer of end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We integrate the training environment, flight dynamics control, DRL algorithms, the MAVROS middleware stack, and hardware into a comprehensive workflow and architecture that enables quadrotors' policies to be trained from scratch to real-world deployment in several minutes. Our platform provides rich types of environments including hovering, dynamic obstacle avoidance, trajectory tracking, balloon hitting, and planning in unknown environments, as a physical experiment benchmark. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate the efficiency of proposed sim-to-real platform, and robust outdoor flight performance under real-world perturbations.

These phenomena are often attributed to the training characteristics of such networks. Aiming at the problem, this paper develops a new intelligent optimizer, Fast-Slow Co-advancing Optimizer (FSCO), which employs reinforcement learning in the training process of GANs to make training easier. Specifically, this paper allows the training step size to be controlled by an agent to improve training stability, and makes the training process more intelligent with variable learning rates, making GANs less sensitive to step size. Experiments have been conducted on three benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness of the developed FSCO.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent improvements, small LLMs struggle to handle questions involving multiple tables and complex SQL patterns under a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) setting. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) partially compensate the knowledge deficits in pretrained models but falls short while dealing with queries involving multi-hop reasoning. To bridge this gap, different LLM training strategies to reinforce reasoning capabilities have been proposed, ranging from leveraging a thinking process within ZSL, including reasoning traces in SFT, or adopt Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies. However, the influence of reasoning on Text2SQL performance is still largely unexplored. This paper investigates to what extent LLM reasoning capabilities influence their Text2SQL performance on four benchmark datasets. To this end, it considers the following LLM settings: (1) ZSL, including general-purpose reasoning or not; (2) SFT, with and without task-specific reasoning traces; (3) RL, leveraging execution accuracy as primary reward function; (4) SFT+RL, i.e, a two-stage approach that combines SFT and RL. The results show that general-purpose reasoning under ZSL proves to be ineffective in tackling complex Text2SQL cases. Small LLMs benefit from SFT with reasoning much more than larger ones, bridging the gap of their (weaker) model pretraining. RL is generally beneficial across all tested models and datasets, particularly when SQL queries involve multi-hop reasoning and multiple tables. Small LLMs with SFT+RL excel on most complex datasets thanks to a strategic balance between generality of the reasoning process and optimization of the execution accuracy. Thanks to RL, the7B Qwen-Coder-2.5 model performs on par with 100+ Billion ones on the Bird dataset.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, the endurance of such systems is constrained by the limited onboard energy, where frequent recharging or battery replacements are required. This consequently disrupts continuous operation and may be impractical in disaster scenarios. To address this challenge, we explore a dual energy harvesting (EH) framework that integrates time-switching (TS), power-splitting (PS), and element-splitting (ES) EH protocols for radio frequency energy, along with solar energy as a renewable source. First, we present the proposed system architecture and EH operating protocols, introducing the proposed hybrid ES-TS-PS EH strategy to extend UAV-mounted RIS endurance. Next, we outline key application scenarios and the associated design challenges. After that, a deep reinforcement learning-based framework is introduced to maximize the EH efficiency by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory, RIS phase shifts, and EH strategies. The framework considers dual EH, hardware impairments, and channel state information imperfections to reflect real-world deployment conditions. The optimization problem is formulated as a Markov decision process and solved using an enhanced deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, incorporating clipped double Q-learning and softmax-based Q-value estimation for improved stability and efficiency. The results demonstrate significant performance gains compared to the considered baseline approaches. Finally, possible challenges and open research directions are presented, highlighting the transformative potential of energy-efficient UAV-mounted RIS networks for IoT systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-Efficient Irregular RIS-aided UAV-Assisted Optimization: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15031v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) enhance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-assisted communication by extending coverage, improving efficiency, and enabling adaptive beamforming. This paper investigates a multiple-input single-output system where a base station (BS) communicates with multiple single-antenna users through a UAV-assisted RIS, dynamically adapting to user mobility to maintain seamless connectivity. To extend UAV-RIS operational time, we propose a hybrid energy-harvesting resource allocation (HERA) strategy that leverages the irregular RIS ON/OFF capability while adapting to BS-RIS and RIS-user channels. The HERA strategy dynamically allocates resources by integrating non-linear radio frequency energy harvesting (EH) based on the time-switching (TS) approach and renewable energy as a complementary source. A non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is formulated to maximize EH efficiency while satisfying quality-of-service, power, and energy constraints under channel state information and hardware impairments. The optimization jointly considers BS transmit power, RIS phase shifts, TS factor, and RIS element selection as decision variables. To solve this problem, we introduce the energy-efficient deep deterministic policy gradient (EE-DDPG) algorithm. This deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach integrates action clipping and softmax-weighted Q-value estimation to mitigate estimation errors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HERA method significantly improves EH efficiency, reaching up to 81.5\% and 73.2\% in single-user and multi-user scenarios, respectively, contributing to extended UAV operational time. Additionally, the proposed EE-DDPG model outperforms existing DRL algorithms while maintaining practical computational complexity.</p></details> |  |

While self-supervised learning in other domains aims to find patterns in a fixed dataset, self-supervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) agents discover new behaviors by learning from the goals achieved during unstructured interaction with the environment. However, these methods have failed to see similar success, both due to a lack of data from slow environment simulations as well as a lack of stable algorithms. We take a step toward addressing both of these issues by releasing a high-performance codebase and benchmark (JaxGCRL) for self-supervised GCRL, enabling researchers to train agents for millions of environment steps in minutes on a single GPU. By utilizing GPU-accelerated replay buffers, environments, and a stable contrastive RL algorithm, we reduce training time by up to $22\times$. Additionally, we assess key design choices in contrastive RL, identifying those that most effectively stabilize and enhance training performance. With this approach, we provide a foundation for future research in self-supervised GCRL, enabling researchers to quickly iterate on new ideas and evaluate them in diverse and challenging environments.

These intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation, followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity.

Specifically, dynamic ball manipulation in rugged environments presents two key challenges. The first is coordinating distinct motion modalities to integrate terrain traversal and ball control seamlessly. The second is overcoming sparse rewards in end-to-end deep reinforcement learning, which impedes efficient policy convergence. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. A high-level policy, informed by proprioceptive data and ball position, adaptively switches between pre-trained low-level skills such as ball dribbling and rough terrain navigation. We further propose Dynamic Skill-Focused Policy Optimization to suppress gradients from inactive skills and enhance critical skill learning. Both simulation and real-world experiments validate that our methods outperform baseline approaches in dynamic ball manipulation across rugged terrains, highlighting its effectiveness in challenging environments.

To address these challenges and more accurately reflect the complexities faced by modern cloud environments, we introduce the Dynamic VM Allocation problem in Multi-NUMA PM (DVAMP). We formally define both offline and online versions of DVAMP as mixed-integer linear programming problems, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for analysis. A tight performance bound for greedy online algorithms is derived, offering insights into the worst-case optimality gap as a function of the number of physical machines and VM lifetime variability. To address the challenges posed by DVAMP, we propose SPANE (Symmetry-Preserving Architecture for Multi-NUMA Environments), a novel deep reinforcement learning approach that exploits the problem's inherent symmetries. SPANE produces invariant results under arbitrary permutations of physical machine states, enhancing learning efficiency and solution quality. Extensive experiments conducted on the Huawei-East-1 dataset demonstrate that SPANE outperforms existing baselines, reducing average VM wait time by 45%. Our work contributes to the field of cloud resource management by providing both theoretical insights and practical solutions for VM scheduling in multi-NUMA environments, addressing a critical gap in the literature and offering improved performance for real-world cloud systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures.

However, existing zero-RL approaches are inherently ``on-policy'', limiting learning to a model's own outputs and failing to acquire reasoning abilities beyond its initial capabilities. We introduce LUFFY (Learning to reason Under oFF-policY guidance), a framework that augments zero-RL with off-policy reasoning traces. LUFFY dynamically balances imitation and exploration by combining off-policy demonstrations with on-policy rollouts during training. Notably, we propose policy shaping via regularized importance sampling to avoid superficial and rigid imitation during mixed-policy training. Remarkably, LUFFY achieves an over +7.0 average gain across six math benchmarks and an advantage of over +6.2 points in out-of-distribution tasks. It also substantially surpasses imitation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT), particularly in generalization. Analysis shows LUFFY not only imitates effectively but also explores beyond demonstrations, offering a scalable path to train generalizable reasoning models with off-policy guidance.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[InstructEngine: Instruction-driven Text-to-Image Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10329v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human/AI Feedback (RLHF/RLAIF) has been extensively utilized for preference alignment of text-to-image models. Existing methods face certain limitations in terms of both data and algorithm. For training data, most approaches rely on manual annotated preference data, either by directly fine-tuning the generators or by training reward models to provide training signals. However, the high annotation cost makes them difficult to scale up, the reward model consumes extra computation and cannot guarantee accuracy. From an algorithmic perspective, most methods neglect the value of text and only take the image feedback as a comparative signal, which is inefficient and sparse. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose the InstructEngine framework. Regarding annotation cost, we first construct a taxonomy for text-to-image generation, then develop an automated data construction pipeline based on it. Leveraging advanced large multimodal models and human-defined rules, we generate 25K text-image preference pairs. Finally, we introduce cross-validation alignment method, which refines data efficiency by organizing semantically analogous samples into mutually comparable pairs. Evaluations on DrawBench demonstrate that InstructEngine improves SD v1.5 and SDXL's performance by 10.53% and 5.30%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation study confirming the benefits of InstructEngine's all components. A win rate of over 50% in human reviews also proves that InstructEngine better aligns with human preferences.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

The system integrates a dual strategy: (1) high-precision multi-AUV localization enabled by Fisher information matrix-optimized USV path planning, and (2) reinforcement learning-based cooperative planning and control method for multi-AUV task execution. Extensive experimental evaluations in the underwater data collection task demonstrate the system's operational feasibility, with quantitative results showing significant performance improvements over baseline methods. The proposed system exhibits robust coordination capabilities between USV and AUVs while maintaining stability in extreme sea conditions.

While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving TIR by optimizing final answer correctness, existing approaches often overlook the efficiency and cost associated with tool usage. This can lead to suboptimal behavior, including excessive tool calls that increase computational and financial overhead, or insufficient tool use that compromises answer quality. In this work, we propose Optimal Tool Call-controlled Policy Optimization (OTC-PO), a simple yet effective RL-based framework that encourages models to produce accurate answers with minimal tool calls. Our method introduces a tool-integrated reward that jointly considers correctness and tool efficiency, promoting high tool productivity. We instantiate this framework within both Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), resulting in OTC-PPO and OTC-GRPO. Experiments with Qwen-2.5 and Qwen-Math across multiple QA benchmarks show that our approach reduces tool calls by up to 73.1\% and improves tool productivity by up to 229.4\%, while maintaining comparable answer accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based framework that explicitly optimizes tool-use efficiency in TIR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recursive Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13241v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring an adversary's goals from exhibited behavior is crucial for counterplanning and non-cooperative multi-agent systems in domains like cybersecurity, military, and strategy games. Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods based on maximum entropy principles show promise in recovering adversaries' goals but are typically offline, require large batch sizes with gradient descent, and rely on first-order updates, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. We propose an online Recursive Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (RDIRL) approach to recover the cost function governing the adversary actions and goals. Specifically, we minimize an upper bound on the standard Guided Cost Learning (GCL) objective using sequential second-order Newton updates, akin to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), leading to a fast (in terms of convergence) learning algorithm. We demonstrate that RDIRL is able to recover cost and reward functions of expert agents in standard and adversarial benchmark tasks. Experiments on benchmark tasks show that our proposed approach outperforms several leading IRL algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Establishing Reliability Metrics for Reward Models in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14838v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reward model (RM) that represents human preferences plays a crucial role in optimizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs), e.g., through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or rejection sampling. However, a long challenge for RM is its uncertain reliability, i.e., LLM outputs with higher rewards may not align with actual human preferences. Currently, there is a lack of a convincing metric to quantify the reliability of RMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textit{\underline{R}eliable at \underline{$\eta$}} (RETA) metric, which directly measures the reliability of an RM by evaluating the average quality (scored by an oracle) of the top $\eta$ quantile responses assessed by an RM. On top of RETA, we present an integrated benchmarking pipeline that allows anyone to evaluate their own RM without incurring additional Oracle labeling costs. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the superior stability of RETA metric, providing solid evaluations of the reliability of various publicly available and proprietary RMs. When dealing with an unreliable RM, we can use the RETA metric to identify the optimal quantile from which to select the responses.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, such as zero-shot reformulations and LLM-based dynamic recognition, struggle with performance degradation when encountering unseen intents, leading to erroneous task routing. To enhance the model's generalization performance on unseen tasks, we employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) combined with a Reward-based Curriculum Sampling (RCS) during Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training in intent detection tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained models substantially outperform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baselines in generalization. Besides, the introduction of the RCS, significantly bolsters the effectiveness of RL in intent detection by focusing the model on challenging cases during training. Moreover, incorporating Chain-of-Thought (COT) processes in RL notably improves generalization in complex intent detection tasks, underscoring the importance of thought in challenging scenarios. This work advances the generalization of intent detection tasks, offering practical insights for deploying adaptable dialogue systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Enhanced Dual-Currency VCG Auction Mechanism for Resource Allocation in IoV: A Value of Information Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14824v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is undergoing a transformative evolution, enabled by advancements in future 6G network technologies, to support intelligent, highly reliable, and low-latency vehicular services. However, the enhanced capabilities of loV have heightened the demands for efficient network resource allocation while simultaneously giving rise to diverse vehicular service requirements. For network service providers (NSPs), meeting the customized resource-slicing requirements of vehicle service providers (VSPs) while maximizing social welfare has become a significant challenge. This paper proposes an innovative solution by integrating a mean-field multi-agent reinforcement learning (MFMARL) framework with an enhanced Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism to address the problem of social welfare maximization under the condition of unknown VSP utility functions. The core of this solution is introducing the ``value of information" as a novel monetary metric to estimate the expected benefits of VSPs, thereby ensuring the effective execution of the VCG auction mechanism. MFMARL is employed to optimize resource allocation for social welfare maximization while adapting to the intelligent and dynamic requirements of IoV. The proposed enhanced VCG auction mechanism not only protects the privacy of VSPs but also reduces the likelihood of collusion among VSPs, and it is theoretically proven to be dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC). The simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the VCG mechanism implemented using quantization methods, the proposed mechanism exhibits significant advantages in convergence speed, social welfare maximization, and resistance to collusion, providing new insights into resource allocation in intelligent 6G networks.</p></details> |  |

This paper draws insights from this behavior to enable agents to learn efficient assembly strategies through visual reinforcement learning. Hence, we propose a Separate Primitive Policy (S2P) to simultaneously learn how to derive location and insertion actions. S2P is compatible with model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. Ten insertion tasks featuring different polygons are developed as benchmarks for evaluations. Simulation experiments show that S2P can boost the sample efficiency and success rate even with force constraints. Real-world experiments are also performed to verify the feasibility of S2P. Ablations are finally given to discuss the generalizability of S2P and some factors that affect its performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Contrastive Skill Learning with State-Transition Based Skill Clustering and Dynamic Length Adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14805v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant progress in various domains, but scaling it to long-horizon tasks with complex decision-making remains challenging. Skill learning attempts to address this by abstracting actions into higher-level behaviors. However, current approaches often fail to recognize semantically similar behaviors as the same skill and use fixed skill lengths, limiting flexibility and generalization. To address this, we propose Dynamic Contrastive Skill Learning (DCSL), a novel framework that redefines skill representation and learning. DCSL introduces three key ideas: state-transition based skill representation, skill similarity function learning, and dynamic skill length adjustment. By focusing on state transitions and leveraging contrastive learning, DCSL effectively captures the semantic context of behaviors and adapts skill lengths to match the appropriate temporal extent of behaviors. Our approach enables more flexible and adaptive skill extraction, particularly in complex or noisy datasets, and demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing methods in task completion and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; 23 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |

While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers an efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback, traditional DPO methods are limited by their reliance on single preference pairs. Recent work like Curriculum-DPO integrates multiple pairs using a one-dimensional difficulty curriculum based on pairwise distinguishability (PD), but overlooks the complexity of the input prompt itself. To address this, we propose 2D-Curri-DPO, a novel framework employing a two-dimensional curriculum that jointly models Prompt Complexity (PC) and Pairwise Distinguishability. This framework introduces dual difficulty metrics to quantify prompt semantic complexity and response preference clarity, defines a curriculum strategy space encompassing multiple selectable strategies for task adaptation, and incorporates a KL-divergence-based adaptive mechanism for dynamic reference model updates to enhance training stability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that 2D-Curri-DPO significantly outperforms standard DPO and prior curriculum methods across multiple benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Vicuna Bench, and WizardLM. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging test sets like UltraFeedback. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of the 2D structure and adaptive mechanisms, while analysis provides guidance for strategy selection. These findings demonstrate that effective alignment requires modeling both prompt complexity and pairwise distinguishability, establishing adaptive, multi-dimensional curriculum learning as a powerful and interpretable new paradigm for preference-based language model optimization.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

The introduction of Open RAN (O-RAN) enables telecommunication providers to leverage network intelligence to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining Quality of Service (QoS). One promising approach involves traffic-aware cell shutdown strategies, where underutilized cells are selectively deactivated without compromising overall network performance. However, achieving this balance requires precise traffic steering mechanisms that account for throughput performance, power efficiency, and network interference constraints. This work proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) model based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to optimize traffic steering and energy efficiency. The objective is to maximize energy efficiency and performance gains while strategically shutting down underutilized cells. The proposed RL model learns adaptive policies to make optimal shutdown decisions by considering throughput degradation constraints, interference thresholds, and PRB utilization balance. Experimental validation using TeraVM Viavi RIC tester data demonstrates that our method significantly improves the network's energy efficiency and downlink throughput.</p></details> |  |

Some approaches have leveraged AI/ML techniques for beamforming and beam selection, however, these methods often overlook the multi-objective nature of PMI selection, which requires balancing spectral efficiency (SE) and interference reduction. This paper proposes an interference-aware PMI selection method using an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) reinforcement learning model, designed for deployment within an O-RAN framework as an xApp. The proposed model prioritizes user equipment (UE) based on a novel strategy and adjusts PMI values accordingly, with interference management and efficient resource utilization. Experimental results in an O-RAN environment demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in improving network performance metrics, including SE and interference mitigation.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has focused on training agents to cooperate on a single task, these specialized models do not generalize to new tasks, even if they are highly similar. Here, we study how reinforcement learning on a distribution of environments with a single partner enables learning general cooperative skills that support ZSC with many new partners on many new problems. We introduce two Jax-based, procedural generators that create billions of solvable coordination challenges. We develop a new paradigm called Cross-Environment Cooperation (CEC), and show that it outperforms competitive baselines quantitatively and qualitatively when collaborating with real people. Our findings suggest that learning to collaborate across many unique scenarios encourages agents to develop general norms, which prove effective for collaboration with different partners. Together, our results suggest a new route toward designing generalist cooperative agents capable of interacting with humans without requiring human data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CogSci 2025, In-review for ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning from Multi-level and Episodic Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14732v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing an effective reward function has long been a challenge in reinforcement learning, particularly for complex tasks in unstructured environments. To address this, various learning paradigms have emerged that leverage different forms of human input to specify or refine the reward function. Reinforcement learning from human feedback is a prominent approach that utilizes human comparative feedback, expressed as a preference for one behavior over another, to tackle this problem. In contrast to comparative feedback, we explore multi-level human feedback, which is provided in the form of a score at the end of each episode. This type of feedback offers more coarse but informative signals about the underlying reward function than binary feedback. Additionally, it can handle non-Markovian rewards, as it is based on the evaluation of an entire episode. We propose an algorithm to efficiently learn both the reward function and the optimal policy from this form of feedback. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves sublinear regret and demonstrate its empirical effectiveness through extensive simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pairwise or Pointwise? Evaluating Feedback Protocols for Bias in LLM-Based Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14716v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as proxies for human labelers in both training (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) and large-scale response evaluation (LLM-as-a-judge). Alignment and evaluation are critical components in the development of reliable LLMs, and the choice of feedback protocol plays a central role in both but remains understudied. In this work, we show that the choice of feedback protocol (absolute scores versus relative preferences) can significantly affect evaluation reliability and induce systematic biases. In particular, we show that pairwise evaluation protocols are more vulnerable to distracted evaluation. Generator models can exploit spurious attributes (or distractor features) favored by the LLM judge, resulting in inflated scores for lower-quality outputs and misleading training signals. We find that absolute scoring is more robust to such manipulation, producing judgments that better reflect response quality and are less influenced by distractor features. Our results demonstrate that generator models can flip preferences by embedding distractor features, skewing LLM-as-a-judge comparisons and leading to inaccurate conclusions about model quality in benchmark evaluations. Pairwise preferences flip in about 35% of the cases, compared to only 9% for absolute scores. We offer recommendations for choosing feedback protocols based on dataset characteristics and evaluation objectives.</p></details> |  |

They offer advantages over traditional optimization-based planning algorithms. These advantages include fewer manually selected parameters and faster development. Within ML-based planning, imitation learning (IL) is a common algorithm. It primarily learns driving policies directly from supervised trajectory data. While IL has demonstrated strong performance on many open-loop benchmarks, it remains challenging to determine if the learned policy truly understands fundamental driving principles, rather than simply extrapolating from the ego-vehicle's initial state. Several studies have identified this limitation and proposed algorithms to address it. However, these methods often use original datasets for evaluation. In these datasets, future trajectories are heavily dependent on initial conditions. Furthermore, IL often overfits to the most common scenarios. It struggles to generalize to rare or unseen situations. To address these challenges, this work proposes: 1) a novel closed-loop simulator supporting both imitation and reinforcement learning, 2) a causal benchmark derived from the Waymo Open Dataset to rigorously assess the impact of the copycat problem, and 3) a novel framework integrating imitation learning and reinforcement learning to overcome the limitations of purely imitative approaches. The code for this work will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by human perception, we propose that focusing on essential data segments, rather than the entire dataset, can improve the accuracy and reliability of the learning models. However, identifying these critical data segments, or "hard attention finding," is challenging, especially in few-shot learning, due to the scarcity of training data and the complexity of model parameters. To address this, we introduce LaHA, a novel framework that leverages language-guided deep reinforcement learning to identify and utilize informative data regions, thereby improving both interpretability and performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of LaHA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-AI Collaboration in Cloud Security: Cognitive Hierarchy-Driven Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16054v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the complexity of multi-tenant cloud environments and the growing need for real-time threat mitigation, Security Operations Centers (SOCs) must adopt AI-driven adaptive defense mechanisms to counter Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). However, SOC analysts face challenges in handling adaptive adversarial tactics, requiring intelligent decision-support frameworks. We propose a Cognitive Hierarchy Theory-driven Deep Q-Network (CHT-DQN) framework that models interactive decision-making between SOC analysts and AI-driven APT bots. The SOC analyst (defender) operates at cognitive level-1, anticipating attacker strategies, while the APT bot (attacker) follows a level-0 policy. By incorporating CHT into DQN, our framework enhances adaptive SOC defense using Attack Graph (AG)-based reinforcement learning. Simulation experiments across varying AG complexities show that CHT-DQN consistently achieves higher data protection and lower action discrepancies compared to standard DQN. A theoretical lower bound further confirms its superiority as AG complexity increases. A human-in-the-loop (HITL) evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) reveals that SOC analysts using CHT-DQN-derived transition probabilities align more closely with adaptive attackers, leading to better defense outcomes. Moreover, human behavior aligns with Prospect Theory (PT) and Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT): participants are less likely to reselect failed actions and more likely to persist with successful ones. This asymmetry reflects amplified loss sensitivity and biased probability weighting -- underestimating gains after failure and overestimating continued success. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating cognitive models into deep reinforcement learning to improve real-time SOC decision-making for cloud security.</p></details> |  |

This theoretical result relaxes the Markov assumption on the stochastic process underlying conventional $Q$-learning, deploying a generalized form of the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation theorem to establish optimality. This result has clear downstream implications for most active subfields of Reinforcement Learning, with clear paths for extension to the field of Causal Inference.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods usually solve the problem with limited resolution of spatial discretization, and/or cannot deal with complex practical constraints well. We propose to enhance the practical applicability of online 3D-BPP via learning on a novel hierarchical representation, packing configuration tree (PCT). PCT is a full-fledged description of the state and action space of bin packing which can support packing policy learning based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The size of the packing action space is proportional to the number of leaf nodes, making the DRL model easy to train and well-performing even with continuous solution space. We further discover the potential of PCT as tree-based planners in deliberately solving packing problems of industrial significance, including large-scale packing and different variations of BPP setting. A recursive packing method is proposed to decompose large-scale packing into smaller sub-trees while a spatial ensemble mechanism integrates local solutions into global. For different BPP variations with additional decision variables, such as lookahead, buffering, and offline packing, we propose a unified planning framework enabling out-of-the-box problem solving. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing online BPP baselines and is versatile in incorporating various practical constraints. The planning process excels across large-scale problems and diverse problem variations. We develop a real-world packing robot for industrial warehousing, with careful designs accounting for constrained placement and transportation stability. Our packing robot operates reliably and efficiently on unprotected pallets at 10 seconds per box. It achieves averagely 19 boxes per pallet with 57.4% space utilization for relatively large-size boxes.</p></details> |  |

A joint surrogate fitness function guides the optimization by combining local diversity, behavioral certainty, and global population diversity. To assess demonstration quality, we apply a set of evaluation metrics, including the reward-based optimality gap, fidelity interquartile means (IQMs), fitness composition analysis, and trajectory visualizations. Hyperparameter sensitivity is also examined to better understand the dynamics of trajectory optimization. Our findings demonstrate that optimizing trajectory selection via surrogate fitness metrics significantly improves interpretability of RL policies in both discrete and continuous environments. In gridworld domains, evaluations reveal significantly enhanced demonstration fidelities compared to random and ablated baselines. In continuous control, the proposed framework offers valuable insights, particularly for early-stage policies, while fidelity-based optimization proves more effective for mature policies. By refining and systematically analyzing surrogate fitness functions, this study advances the interpretability of RL models. The proposed improvements provide deeper insights into RL decision-making, benefiting applications in safety-critical and explainability-focused domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures, under review</p></details> |

Such a lack of \textit{semantic dependencies} modeling among multi-entities leads to unreliable outputs, intensifying MLLMs' hallucinations and over-reliance on language priors. To this end, we propose Relation-R1, the first unified relational comprehension framework that explicitly integrates cognitive chain-of-thought (CoT)-guided Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we first establish foundational reasoning capabilities via SFT, enforcing structured outputs with thinking processes. Then, GRPO is utilized to refine these outputs via multi-reward optimization, prioritizing visual-semantic grounding over language-induced biases, thereby improving generalization capability. Extensive experiments on widely-used PSG and SWiG datasets demonstrate that Relation-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both binary and \textit{N}-ary relation understanding.</p></details> | Ongoing project |

Efficient IIoT operations require a trade-off between model quality and training latency. Consequently, a primary challenge of FL in IIoT is to optimize overall system performance by balancing model quality and training latency. This paper designs a satisfaction function that accounts for data size, Age of Information (AoI), and training latency for meta-computing. Additionally, the satisfaction function is incorporated into the utility functions to incentivize nodes in IIoT participation in model training. We model the utility functions of servers and nodes as a two-stage Stackelberg game and employ a deep reinforcement learning approach to learn the Stackelberg equilibrium. This approach ensures balanced rewards and enhances the applicability of the incentive scheme for IIoT. Simulation results demonstrate that, under the same budget constraints, the proposed incentive scheme improves utility by at least 23.7% compared to existing FL schemes without compromising model accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging Level-k game theory, we model human driver decision-making using reinforcement learning pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. This enables the resulting models to exhibit diverse behaviors, improving the intelligence and realism of surrounding vehicles in simulation. Building upon this capability, we further develop a scenario generation framework that utilizes the Poisson cognitive hierarchy theory to control the distribution of vehicles with different driving styles through Poisson and binomial sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that CHARMS is capable of both making intelligent decisions as an ego vehicle and generating diverse, realistic driving scenarios as surrounding vehicles. The code for CHARMS will be released at https://github.com/WUTAD-Wjy/CHARMS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Auto-Bidding with Value-Guided Explorations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14587v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-bidding, with its strong capability to optimize bidding decisions within dynamic and competitive online environments, has become a pivotal strategy for advertising platforms. Existing approaches typically employ rule-based strategies or Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. However, rule-based strategies lack the flexibility to adapt to time-varying market conditions, and RL-based methods struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observations within Markov Decision Process (MDP) frameworks. Furthermore, these approaches often face challenges in ensuring strategy adaptability across diverse advertising objectives. Additionally, as offline training methods are increasingly adopted to facilitate the deployment and maintenance of stable online strategies, the issues of documented behavioral patterns and behavioral collapse resulting from training on fixed offline datasets become increasingly significant. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel offline Generative Auto-bidding framework with Value-Guided Explorations (GAVE). GAVE accommodates various advertising objectives through a score-based Return-To-Go (RTG) module. Moreover, GAVE integrates an action exploration mechanism with an RTG-based evaluation method to explore novel actions while ensuring stability-preserving updates. A learnable value function is also designed to guide the direction of action exploration and mitigate Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problems. Experimental results on two offline datasets and real-world deployments demonstrate that GAVE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both offline evaluations and online A/B tests. The implementation code is publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |

Machine Learning (ML) methods used in UAV-assisted Sensor Networks (UASNETs) and especially in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) face challenges such as complex and lengthy model training, gaps between simulation and reality, and low sample efficiency, which conflict with the urgency of emergencies such as SAR operations. This paper proposes In-Context Learning (ICL)-based Data Collection Scheduling (ICLDC) scheme, as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The UAV collects and transmits logged sensory data, to an LLM, to generate a task description in natural language, from which it obtains a data collection schedule to be executed by the UAV. The system continuously adapts by adding feedback to task descriptions and utilizing feedback for future decisions. This method is tested against jailbreaking attacks, where task description is manipulated to undermine network performance, highlighting the vulnerability of LLMs to such attacks. The proposed ICLDC outperforms the Maximum Channel Gain by reducing cumulative packet loss by approximately 56\%. ICLDC presents a promising direction for intelligent scheduling and control in UAV-assisted data collection.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures, |

Meta-thinking self-reflection, assessment, and control of thinking processes is an important next step in enhancing LLM reliability, flexibility, and performance, particularly for complex or high-stakes tasks. The survey begins by analyzing current LLM limitations, such as hallucinations and the lack of internal self-assessment mechanisms. It then talks about newer methods, including RL from human feedback (RLHF), self-distillation, and chain-of-thought prompting, and each of their limitations. The crux of the survey is to talk about how multi-agent architectures, namely supervisor-agent hierarchies, agent debates, and theory of mind frameworks, can emulate human-like introspective behavior and enhance LLM robustness. By exploring reward mechanisms, self-play, and continuous learning methods in MARL, this survey gives a comprehensive roadmap to building introspective, adaptive, and trustworthy LLMs. Evaluation metrics, datasets, and future research avenues, including neuroscience-inspired architectures and hybrid symbolic reasoning, are also discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

MARL corresponds to the learning problem in a multi-agent system in which multiple agents learn simultaneously. It is an interdisciplinary domain with a long history that includes game theory, machine learning, stochastic control, psychology, and optimisation. Although MARL has achieved considerable empirical success in solving real-world games, there is a lack of a self-contained overview in the literature that elaborates the game theoretical foundations of modern MARL methods and summarises the recent advances. In fact, the majority of existing surveys are outdated and do not fully cover the recent developments since 2010. In this work, we provide a monograph on MARL that covers both the fundamentals and the latest developments in the research frontier. The goal of our monograph is to provide a self-contained assessment of the current state-of-the-art MARL techniques from a game theoretical perspective. We expect this work to serve as a stepping stone for both new researchers who are about to enter this fast-growing domain and existing domain experts who want to obtain a panoramic view and identify new directions based on recent advances.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Imitation to Exploration: End-to-end Autonomous Driving based on World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02253v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, end-to-end autonomous driving architectures have gained increasing attention due to their advantage in avoiding error accumulation. Most existing end-to-end autonomous driving methods are based on Imitation Learning (IL), which can quickly derive driving strategies by mimicking expert behaviors. However, IL often struggles to handle scenarios outside the training dataset, especially in high-dynamic and interaction-intensive traffic environments. In contrast, Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based driving models can optimize driving decisions through interaction with the environment, improving adaptability and robustness. To leverage the strengths of both IL and RL, we propose RAMBLE, an end-to-end world model-based RL method for driving decision-making. RAMBLE extracts environmental context information from RGB images and LiDAR data through an asymmetrical variational autoencoder. A transformer-based architecture is then used to capture the dynamic transitions of traffic participants. Next, an actor-critic structure reinforcement learning algorithm is applied to derive driving strategies based on the latent features of the current state and dynamics. To accelerate policy convergence and ensure stable training, we introduce a training scheme that initializes the policy network using IL, and employs KL loss and soft update mechanisms to smoothly transition the model from IL to RL. RAMBLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in route completion rate on the CARLA Leaderboard 1.0 and completes all 38 scenarios on the CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex and dynamic traffic scenarios. The model will be open-sourced upon paper acceptance at https://github.com/SCP-CN-001/ramble to support further research and development in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables; T-ITS under review</p></details> |

However, existing path planning methodologies fall short of addressing this need due to their incapability to handle the diverse and complex parking scenarios in reality. While non-learning methods provide reliable planning results, they are vulnerable to intricate occasions, whereas learning-based ones are good at exploration but unstable in converging to feasible solutions. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we introduce Hybrid pOlicy Path plannEr (HOPE). This novel solution integrates a reinforcement learning agent with Reeds-Shepp curves, enabling effective planning across diverse scenarios. HOPE guides the exploration of the reinforcement learning agent by applying an action mask mechanism and employs a transformer to integrate the perceived environmental information with the mask. To facilitate the training and evaluation of the proposed planner, we propose a criterion for categorizing the difficulty level of parking scenarios based on space and obstacle distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms typical rule-based algorithms and traditional reinforcement learning methods, showing higher planning success rates and generalization across various scenarios. We also conduct real-world experiments to verify the practicability of HOPE. The code for our solution is openly available on https://github.com/jiamiya/HOPE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by T-ITS. 11 pages, 5 tables, 6 figures, 2 page appendix</p></details> |
| **[Fast Adaptive Anti-Jamming Channel Access via Deep Q Learning and Coarse-Grained Spectrum Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04963v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the anti-jamming channel access problem in complex and unknown jamming environments, where the jammer could dynamically adjust its strategies to target different channels. Traditional channel hopping anti-jamming approaches using fixed patterns are ineffective against such dynamic jamming attacks. Although the emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based dynamic channel access approach could achieve the Nash equilibrium under fast-changing jamming attacks, it requires extensive training episodes. To address this issue, we propose a fast adaptive anti-jamming channel access approach guided by the intuition of ``learning faster than the jammer", where a synchronously updated coarse-grained spectrum prediction serves as an auxiliary task for the deep Q learning (DQN) based anti-jamming model. This helps the model identify a superior Q-function compared to standard DRL while significantly reducing the number of training episodes. Numerical results indicate that the proposed approach significantly accelerates the rate of convergence in model training, reducing the required training episodes by up to 70% compared to standard DRL. Additionally, it also achieves a 10% improvement in throughput over NE strategies, owing to the effective use of coarse-grained spectrum prediction.</p></details> |  |

In the paper, we study a class of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization with nonsmooth regularization, where the objective function is possibly nonconvex on primal variable $x$, and it is nonconcave and satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition on dual variable $y$. Moreover, we propose a class of enhanced momentum-based gradient descent ascent methods (i.e., MSGDA and AdaMSGDA) to solve these stochastic nonconvex-PL minimax problems. In particular, our AdaMSGDA algorithm can use various adaptive learning rates in updating the variables $x$ and $y$ without relying on any specifical types. Theoretically, we prove that our methods have the best known sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ only requiring one sample at each loop in finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution. Some numerical experiments on PL-game and Wasserstein-GAN demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in AISTATS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Steganography in Game Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10442v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exchange of messages has always carried with it the timeless challenge of secrecy. From whispers in shadows to the enigmatic notes written in the margins of history, humanity has long sought ways to convey thoughts that remain imperceptible to all but the chosen few. The challenge of subliminal communication has been addressed in various forms of steganography. However, the field faces a fundamental paradox: as the art of concealment advances, so too does the science of revelation, leading to an ongoing evolutionary interplay. This study seeks to extend the boundaries of what is considered a viable steganographic medium. We explore a steganographic paradigm, in which hidden information is communicated through the episodes of multiple agents interacting with an environment. Each agent, acting as an encoder, learns a policy to disguise the very existence of hidden messages within actions seemingly directed toward innocent objectives. Meanwhile, an observer, serving as a decoder, learns to associate behavioural patterns with their respective agents despite their dynamic nature, thereby unveiling the hidden messages. The interactions of agents are governed by the framework of multi-agent reinforcement learning and shaped by feedback from the observer. This framework encapsulates a game-theoretic dilemma, wherein agents face decisions between cooperating to create distinguishable behavioural patterns or defecting to pursue individually optimal yet potentially overlapping episodic actions. As a proof of concept, we exemplify action steganography through the game of labyrinth, a navigation task where subliminal communication is concealed within the act of steering toward a destination, and systematically validate the stego-system in terms of distortion, capacity, secrecy and robustness when subjected to simulated passive and active adversaries.</p></details> |  |

Traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches often rely on monolithic value representations, limiting their ability to adapt to individual preferences. We introduce a novel framework that leverages low-rank preference modeling to efficiently learn and generalize user-specific reward functions. By representing reward functions in a low-dimensional subspace and modeling individual preferences as weighted combinations of shared basis functions, our approach avoids rigid user categorization while enabling scalability and few-shot adaptation. We validate our method on multiple preference datasets, demonstrating superior generalization to unseen users and improved accuracy in preference prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

This growth enhances functionality, e.g., automation, remote monitoring, and control, and introduces substantial security challenges, especially in defending these devices against cyber threats. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial for securing IoT; however, traditional IDS often struggle to adapt to IoT networks' dynamic and evolving nature and threat patterns. A potential solution is using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enhance IDS adaptability, enabling them to learn from and react to their operational environment dynamically. This systematic review examines the application of DRL to enhance IDS in IoT settings, covering research from the past ten years. This review underscores the state-of-the-art DRL techniques employed to improve adaptive threat detection and real-time security across IoT domains by analyzing various studies. Our findings demonstrate that DRL significantly enhances IDS capabilities by enabling systems to learn and adapt from their operational environment. This adaptability allows IDS to improve threat detection accuracy and minimize false positives, making it more effective in identifying genuine threats while reducing unnecessary alerts. Additionally, this systematic review identifies critical research gaps and future research directions, emphasizing the necessity for more diverse datasets, enhanced reproducibility, and improved integration with emerging IoT technologies. This review aims to foster the development of dynamic and adaptive IDS solutions essential for protecting IoT networks against sophisticated cyber threats.</p></details> |  |

The vast range of spatiotemporal scales inherent in these systems currently renders full resolution impractical, necessitating the development of effective closure models for under-resolved simulations. Under-resolved LBMs are unstable, and while there is a number of important efforts to stabilize them, they often face limitations in generalizing across scales and physical systems. We present a novel, data-driven, multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that drastically improves stability and accuracy of coarse-grained LBM simulations. The proposed method uses a convolutional neural network to dynamically control the local relaxation parameter for the LB across the simulation grid. The LB-MARL framework is showcased in turbulent Kolmogorov flows. We find that the MARL closures stabilize the simulations and recover the energy spectra of significantly more expensive fully resolved simulations while maintaining computational efficiency. The learned closure model can be transferred to flow scenarios unseen during training and has improved robustness and spectral accuracy compared to traditional LBM models. We believe that MARL closures open new frontiers for efficient and accurate simulations of a multitude of complex problems not accessible to present-day LB methods alone.</p></details> |  |

By modifying the reward mechanism to penalize moves that do no increase the fitness value and relying on the local auxiliary objectives, LRSAO dynamically adapts its selection strategy to optimize performance according to the landscape and unlearn previous objectives when necessary. We analyze and evaluate LRSAO on the black-box complexity version of the non-monotonic Jump function, with gap parameter $\ell$, where each auxiliary objective is beneficial at specific stages of optimization. The Jump function is hard to optimize for evolutionary-based algorithms and the best-known complexity for reinforcement-based selection on Jump was $O(n^2 \log(n) / \ell)$. Our approach improves over this result to achieve a complexity of $\Theta(n^2 / \ell^2 + n \log(n))$ resulting in a significant improvement, which demonstrates the efficiency and adaptability of LRSAO, highlighting its potential to outperform traditional methods in complex optimization scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference version with an appendix containing the proofs omitted for reasons of space</p></details> |

Novel approaches using reinforcement learning (RL) agents have been proposed to help grid operators navigate the massive decision space and nonlinear behavior of these complex networks. However, applying RL to power grid security assessment, specifically for combinatorially troublesome contingency analysis problems, has proven difficult to scale. The integration of quantum computing into these RL frameworks helps scale by improving computational efficiency and boosting agent proficiency by leveraging quantum advantages in action exploration and model-based interdependence. To demonstrate a proof-of-concept use of quantum computing for RL agent training and simulation, we propose a hybrid agent that runs on quantum hardware using IBM's Qiskit Runtime. We also provide detailed insight into the construction of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for generating relevant quantum output. This agent's proficiency at maintaining grid stability is demonstrated relative to a benchmark model without quantum enhancement using N-k contingency analysis.

Existing approaches are either limited to simulations that overlook hardware constraints or rely on predefined ground-specific motion trajectories, failing to enable standing up across postures in real-world scenes. To bridge this gap, we present HoST (Humanoid Standing-up Control), a reinforcement learning framework that learns standing-up control from scratch, enabling robust sim-to-real transfer across diverse postures. HoST effectively learns posture-adaptive motions by leveraging a multi-critic architecture and curriculum-based training on diverse simulated terrains. To ensure successful real-world deployment, we constrain the motion with smoothness regularization and implicit motion speed bound to alleviate oscillatory and violent motions on physical hardware, respectively. After simulation-based training, the learned control policies are directly deployed on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our experimental results demonstrate that the controllers achieve smooth, stable, and robust standing-up motions across a wide range of laboratory and outdoor environments.

| **[Improving RL Exploration for LLM Reasoning through Retrospective Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14363v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has increasingly become a pivotal technique in the post-training of large language models (LLMs). The effective exploration of the output space is essential for the success of RL. We observe that for complex problems, during the early stages of training, the model exhibits strong exploratory capabilities and can identify promising solution ideas. However, its limited capability at this stage prevents it from successfully solving these problems. The early suppression of these potentially valuable solution ideas by the policy gradient hinders the model's ability to revisit and re-explore these ideas later. Consequently, although the LLM's capabilities improve in the later stages of training, it still struggles to effectively address these complex problems. To address this exploration issue, we propose a novel algorithm named Retrospective Replay-based Reinforcement Learning (RRL), which introduces a dynamic replay mechanism throughout the training process. RRL enables the model to revisit promising states identified in the early stages, thereby improving its efficiency and effectiveness in exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness of RRL, we conduct extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation, and general dialogue tasks. The results indicate that RRL maintains high exploration efficiency throughout the training period, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of RL in optimizing LLMs for complicated reasoning tasks. Moreover, it also improves the performance of RLHF, making the model both safer and more helpful.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

In the context of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), self-play not only boosts Large Language Model (LLM) performance but also overcomes the limitations of traditional Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumptions by finding the Nash equilibrium (NE) of a preference-based, two-player constant-sum game. However, existing methods either guarantee only average-iterate convergence, incurring high storage and inference costs, or converge to the NE of a regularized game, failing to accurately reflect true human preferences. In this paper, we introduce Magnetic Preference Optimization (MPO), a novel approach capable of achieving last-iterate convergence to the NE of the original game, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing methods. Building upon Magnetic Mirror Descent (MMD), MPO attains a linear convergence rate, making it particularly suitable for fine-tuning LLMs. To ensure our algorithm is both theoretically sound and practically viable, we present a simple yet effective implementation that adapts the theoretical insights to the RLHF setting. Empirical results demonstrate that MPO can significantly enhance the performance of LLMs, highlighting the potential of self-play methods in alignment.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

In this work, we present two-Staged history-Resampling Policy Optimization (SRPO), which successfully surpasses the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero-32B on the AIME24 and LiveCodeBench benchmarks. SRPO achieves this using the same base model as DeepSeek (i.e. Qwen2.5-32B) and relies solely on RL, without prior Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Building upon Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), we introduce two key methodological innovations: (1) a two-stage cross-domain training paradigm designed to balance the development of mathematical reasoning and coding proficiency, and (2) History Resampling (HR), a technique to address ineffective samples. Our comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, dedicating to offer valuable insights into scaling LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |

By modeling precision selection as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we employ Q-learning to adaptively assign precision levels to key operations, striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and numerical accuracy, while ensuring stability through double-precision scalar computations and residual computing. In practice, the algorithm is trained on a set of data and subsequently performs inference for precision selection on out-of-sample data, without requiring re-analysis or retraining for new datasets. This enables the method to adapt seamlessly to new problem instances without the computational overhead of recalibration. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of RL in enhancing solver's performance, marking the first application of RL to mixed-precision numerical methods. The findings highlight the approach's practical advantages, robustness, and scalability, providing valuable insights into its integration with iterative solvers and paving the way for AI-driven advancements in scientific computing.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in generative modeling aim to address these issues by providing uncertainty quantification and correction. However, the quality of generated simulation remains heavily dependent on the choice of conditioning priors. In this work, we present an efficient generative framework for dynamics emulation, unifying principles of turbulence with diffusion-based modeling: Cohesion. Specifically, our method estimates large-scale coherent structure of the underlying dynamics as guidance during the denoising process, where small-scale fluctuation in the flow is then resolved. These coherent priors are efficiently approximated using reduced-order models, such as deep Koopman operators, that allow for rapid generation of long prior sequences while maintaining stability over extended forecasting horizon. With this gain, we can reframe forecasting as trajectory planning, a common task in reinforcement learning, where conditional denoising is performed once over entire sequences, minimizing the computational cost of autoregressive-based generative methods. Empirical evaluations on chaotic systems of increasing complexity, including Kolmogorov flow, shallow water equations, and subseasonal-to-seasonal climate dynamics, demonstrate Cohesion superior long-range forecasting skill that can efficiently generate physically-consistent simulations, even in the presence of partially-observed guidance.</p></details> | 41 pages, 25 figures |
| **[InfiGUI-R1: Advancing Multimodal GUI Agents from Reactive Actors to Deliberative Reasoners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14239v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have powered Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents, showing promise in automating tasks on computing devices. Recent works have begun exploring reasoning in GUI tasks with encouraging results. However, many current approaches rely on manually designed reasoning templates, which may result in reasoning that is not sufficiently robust and adaptive for complex GUI environments. Meanwhile, some existing agents continue to operate as Reactive Actors, relying primarily on implicit reasoning that may lack sufficient depth for GUI tasks demanding planning and error recovery. We argue that advancing these agents requires a shift from reactive acting towards acting based on deliberate reasoning. To facilitate this transformation, we introduce InfiGUI-R1, an MLLM-based GUI agent developed through our Actor2Reasoner framework, a reasoning-centric, two-stage training approach designed to progressively evolve agents from Reactive Actors to Deliberative Reasoners. The first stage, Reasoning Injection, focuses on establishing a basic reasoner. We employ Spatial Reasoning Distillation to transfer cross-modal spatial reasoning capabilities from teacher models to MLLMs through trajectories with explicit reasoning steps, enabling models to integrate GUI visual-spatial information with logical reasoning before action generation. The second stage, Deliberation Enhancement, refines the basic reasoner into a deliberative one using Reinforcement Learning. This stage introduces two approaches: Sub-goal Guidance, which rewards models for generating accurate intermediate sub-goals, and Error Recovery Scenario Construction, which creates failure-and-recovery training scenarios from identified prone-to-error steps. Experimental results show InfiGUI-R1 achieves strong performance in GUI grounding and trajectory tasks.

| **[Large Language Model for Verilog Generation with Code-Structure-Guided Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18271v4)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked significant interest in the automatic generation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs, particularly using Verilog. Current research on this topic primarily focuses on pre-training and instruction tuning, but the effectiveness of these methods is constrained by the limited availability of training data, as public Verilog code is far less abundant than software code. In particular, these methods struggle to effectively capture Verilog parallel code structures, which fundamentally differ from the imperative, sequential control flow typical in most software programming languages. This paper introduces VeriSeek, an LLM enhanced by reinforcement learning using a limited amount of high-quality training data to achieve high Verilog code generation performance. Our reinforcement learning approach employs code structure information as feedback signals to refine the pre-trained model, enabling it to effectively learn important patterns from Verilog code with parallel structures. Experiments show that VeriSeek outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods manually design prompts for the LLM to generate adversarial prompts, which effectively bypass safety filters while producing sensitive images, exposing safety vulnerabilities of T2I models. However, due to the LLM's limited understanding of the T2I model and its safety filters, existing methods require numerous queries to achieve a successful attack, limiting their practical applicability. To address this issue, we propose Reason2Attack(R2A), which aims to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities in generating adversarial prompts by incorporating the jailbreaking attack into the post-training process of the LLM. Specifically, we first propose a CoT example synthesis pipeline based on Frame Semantics, which generates adversarial prompts by identifying related terms and corresponding context illustrations. Using CoT examples generated by the pipeline, we fine-tune the LLM to understand the reasoning path and format the output structure. Subsequently, we incorporate the jailbreaking attack task into the reinforcement learning process of the LLM and design an attack process reward that considers prompt length, prompt stealthiness, and prompt effectiveness, aiming to further enhance reasoning accuracy. Extensive experiments on various T2I models show that R2A achieves a better attack success ratio while requiring fewer queries than baselines. Moreover, our adversarial prompts demonstrate strong attack transferability across both open-source and commercial T2I models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive or distressing material</p></details> |

However, the straightforward replacement of humans with AI deprives LLMs from learning more fine-grained AI supervision beyond binary signals. In this paper, we propose Direct Advantage Regression (DAR), a simple alignment algorithm using online AI reward to optimize policy improvement through weighted supervised fine-tuning. As an RL-free approach, DAR maintains theoretical consistency with online RLHF pipelines while significantly reducing implementation complexity and improving learning efficiency. Our empirical results underscore that AI reward is a better form of AI supervision consistently achieving higher human-AI agreement as opposed to AI preference. Additionally, evaluations using GPT-4-Turbo and MT-bench show that DAR outperforms both OAIF and online RLHF baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v5)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025.

A flexible spine enables undulation of the body through a wavelike motion along the spine, aiding navigation over uneven terrains and obstacles. Yet environmental uncertainties, such as surface irregularities and variations in friction, can significantly disrupt body-limb coordination and cause discrepancies between predictions from mathematical models and real-world outcomes. Addressing this challenge requires the development of sophisticated control strategies capable of dynamically adapting to uncertain conditions while maintaining efficient locomotion. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a promising framework for handling non-deterministic environments and enabling robotic systems to adapt effectively and perform robustly under challenging conditions. In this study, we comparatively examine learning-based control strategies and biologically inspired gait design methods on a salamander-like robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been accepted for presentation at the Mechanical Intelligence in Robotics workshop at ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Typically, this is accomplished by relying on a therapist's training and intuition along with feedback from a patient. However, this requires the therapist to become an expert on any technological components, such as in the case of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET). While there exist approaches to automatically adapt therapeutic content to a patient, they generally rely on hand-authored, pre-defined rules, which may not generalize to all individuals. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically adapt therapeutic content to patients based on physiological measures. We implement our approach in the context of virtual reality arachnophobia exposure therapy, and rely on experience-driven procedural content generation via reinforcement learning (EDPCGRL) to generate virtual spiders to match an individual patient. Through a human subject study, we demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms a more common rules-based method, highlighting its potential for enhancing personalized therapeutic interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Bridge (Collaborative AI and Modelling of Humans Bridge Program)</p></details> |

At the same time, recent breakthroughs in reasoning models, such as Deepseek-R1, unlock the opportunity for reinforcement learning to improve LLM reasoning skills. An in-depth understanding of how ITC interacts with reasoning across different models could provide important guidance on how to further advance the LLM frontier. This work conducts a comprehensive analysis of inference-time scaling methods for both reasoning and non-reasoning models on challenging reasoning tasks. Specifically, we focus our research on verifier-free inference time-scaling methods due to its generalizability without needing a reward model. We construct the Pareto frontier of quality and efficiency. We find that non-reasoning models, even with an extremely high inference budget, still fall substantially behind reasoning models. For reasoning models, majority voting proves to be a robust inference strategy, generally competitive or outperforming other more sophisticated ITC methods like best-of-N and sequential revisions, while the additional inference compute offers minimal improvements. We further perform in-depth analyses of the association of key response features (length and linguistic markers) with response quality, with which we can improve the existing ITC methods. We find that correct responses from reasoning models are typically shorter and have fewer hedging and thinking markers (but more discourse markers) than the incorrect responses.</p></details> |  |

Anthropological evidence suggests that the earliest forms of some writing systems originally consisted of iconic pictographs, which signify their referent via visual resemblance. While previous studies have examined the emergence and, separately, the evolution of pictographic systems through a computational lens, most employ non-naturalistic methodologies that make it difficult to draw clear analogies to human and animal cognition. We develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning testbed for emergent communication called a Signification Game, and formulate a model of inferential communication that enables agents to leverage visual theory of mind to communicate actions using pictographs. Our model, which is situated within a broader formalism for animal communication, sheds light on the cognitive and cultural processes underlying the emergence of proto-writing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an oral to CogSci 2025, published here with permission from organizers</p></details> |
| **[Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in mathematics and programming tasks. It is widely believed that RLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities that exceed corresponding base models' capacity. In this study, however, we critically re-examines this assumption by measuring the pass@\textit{k} metric with large values of \textit{k} to explore the reasoning capability boundary of the models across a wide range of model families and benchmarks. Surprisingly, the RL does \emph{not}, in fact, elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RL-trained models outperform their base models at smaller values of $k$ (\eg, $k$=1), base models can achieve a comparable or even higher pass@$k$ score compared to their RL counterparts at large $k$ values. The reasoning paths generated by RL-trained models are already included in the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that most reasoning abilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models. Further analysis shows that RL training boosts the performance by biasing the model's output distribution toward paths that are more likely to yield rewards, therefore sampling correct responses more efficiently. But this also results in a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. Similar results are observed in visual reasoning tasks trained with RLVR. Moreover, we find that distillation can genuinely introduce new knowledge into the model, different from RLVR. These findings underscore a critical limitation of RLVR in advancing LLM reasoning abilities which requires us to fundamentally rethink the impact of RL training in reasoning LLMs and the need of a better paradigm.

To address this asymmetry, we introduce PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling), a framework that strategically decouples these phases by generating numerous rollouts in parallel but updating only on an informative subset. Within this framework, we develop max-variance down-sampling, a theoretically motivated method that selects rollouts with maximally diverse reward signals. We prove that this approach has an efficient algorithmic solution, and empirically demonstrate that GRPO with PODS using max-variance down-sampling achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on the GSM8K benchmark.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

However, this approach not only demands extensive amounts of training data but also struggles to effectively understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. The issue significantly limits its application in real-world scenarios, especially for high-level tasks. Inspired by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), which efficiently enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models in real-world settings, we propose \name, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the GUI capabilities of LVLMs in high-level real-world task scenarios, through unified action space rule modeling. By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update the model, \name achieves superior performance using only 0.02\% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks.</p></details> |  |

Flex-rate transponders allow existing lightpaths to accommodate new services, a task we term routing and wavelength assignment with lightpath reuse (RWA-LR). We re-examine this problem and present a thorough benchmarking of heuristic algorithms for RWA-LR, which are shown to have 6% increased throughput when candidate paths are ordered by number of hops, rather than total length. We train an RL agent for RWA-LR with graph attention networks for the policy and value functions to exploit the graph-structured data. We provide details of our methodology and open source all of our code for reproduction. We outperform the previous state-of-the-art RL approach by 2.5% (17.4 Tbps mean additional throughput) and the best heuristic by 1.2% (8.5 Tbps mean additional throughput). This marginal gain highlights the difficulty in learning effective RL policies on long horizon resource allocation tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, identifying suitable candidates from a rapidly growing and continuously evolving collection of TPLs remains a challenging task. TPL recommender systems have been studied, offering a promising solution to address this issue. They typically rely on collaborative filtering (CF) that exploits a two-dimensional project-library matrix (user-item in general context of recommendation) when making recommendations. We have noticed that CF-based approaches often encounter two challenges: (i) a tendency to recommend popular items more frequently, making them even more dominant, a phenomenon known as popularity bias, and (ii) difficulty in generating recommendations for new users or items due to limited user-item interactions, commonly referred to as the cold-start problem. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach to address popularity bias and the cold-start problem in TPL recommendation. Our method comprises three key components. First, we utilize a graph convolution network (GCN)-based embedding model to learn user preferences and user-item interactions, allowing us to capture complex relationships within interaction subgraphs and effectively represent new user/item embeddings. Second, we introduce an aggregation operator to generate a representative embedding from user and item embeddings, which is then used to model cold-start users. Finally, we adopt a model-based RL framework for TPL recommendation, where popularity bias is mitigated through a carefully designed reward function and a rarity-based replay buffer partitioning strategy. The results demonstrated that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in cold-start scenarios while effectively mitigating the impact of popularity bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Dynamic Safety Shield for Safe and Efficient Reinforcement Learning of Navigation Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04153v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to a variety of robotics applications, where it outperforms classical methods. However, the safety aspect of RL and the transfer to the real world remain an open challenge. A prominent field for tackling this challenge and ensuring the safety of the agents during training and execution is safe reinforcement learning. Safe RL can be achieved through constrained RL and safe exploration approaches. The former learns the safety constraints over the course of training to achieve a safe behavior by the end of training, at the cost of high number of collisions at earlier stages of the training. The latter offers robust safety by enforcing the safety constraints as hard constraints, which prevents collisions but hinders the exploration of the RL agent, resulting in lower rewards and poor performance. To overcome those drawbacks, we propose a novel safety shield, that combines the robustness of the optimization-based controllers with the long prediction capabilities of the RL agents, allowing the RL agent to adaptively tune the parameters of the controller. Our approach is able to improve the exploration of the RL agents for navigation tasks, while minimizing the number of collisions. Experiments in simulation show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in the reached goals-to-collisions ratio in different challenging environments. The goals-to-collisions ratio metrics emphasizes the importance of minimizing the number of collisions, while learning to accomplish the task. Our approach achieves a higher number of reached goals compared to the classic safety shields and fewer collisions compared to constrained RL approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in a real-world experiment.</p></details> | Accepted in L4DC2025 |
| **[A Reinforcement Learning Method to Factual and Counterfactual Explanations for Session-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13632v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session-based Recommendation (SR) systems have recently achieved considerable success, yet their complex, "black box" nature often obscures why certain recommendations are made. Existing explanation methods struggle to pinpoint truly influential factors, as they frequently depend on static user profiles or fail to grasp the intricate dynamics within user sessions. In response, we introduce FCESR (Factual and Counterfactual Explanations for Session-based Recommendation), a novel framework designed to illuminate SR model predictions by emphasizing both the sufficiency (factual) and necessity (counterfactual) of recommended items. By recasting explanation generation as a combinatorial optimization challenge and leveraging reinforcement learning, our method uncovers the minimal yet critical sequence of items influencing recommendations. Moreover, recognizing the intrinsic value of robust explanations, we innovatively utilize these factual and counterfactual insights within a contrastive learning paradigm, employing them as high-quality positive and negative samples to fine-tune and significantly enhance SR accuracy. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations across diverse datasets and multiple SR architectures confirm that our framework not only boosts recommendation accuracy but also markedly elevates the quality and interpretability of explanations, thereby paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the application of sim-to-real deep reinforcement learning (RL) for the design of bipedal locomotion controllers for humanoid robots on compliant and uneven terrains. Our key contribution is to show that a simple training curriculum for exposing the RL agent to randomized terrains in simulation can achieve robust walking on a real humanoid robot using only proprioceptive feedback. We train an end-to-end bipedal locomotion policy using the proposed approach, and show extensive real-robot demonstration on the HRP-5P humanoid over several difficult terrains inside and outside the lab environment. Further, we argue that the robustness of a bipedal walking policy can be improved if the robot is allowed to exhibit aperiodic motion with variable stepping frequency. We propose a new control policy to enable modification of the observed clock signal, leading to adaptive gait frequencies depending on the terrain and command velocity. Through simulation experiments, we show the effectiveness of this policy specifically for walking over challenging terrains by controlling swing and stance durations.

| **[Compile Scene Graphs with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13617v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next token prediction is the fundamental principle for training large language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their reasoning performance. As an effective way to model language, image, video, and other modalities, the use of LLMs for end-to-end extraction of structured visual representations, such as scene graphs, remains underexplored. It requires the model to accurately produce a set of objects and relationship triplets, rather than generating text token by token. To achieve this, we introduce R1-SGG, a multimodal LLM (M-LLM) initially trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the scene graph dataset and subsequently refined using reinforcement learning to enhance its ability to generate scene graphs in an end-to-end manner. The SFT follows a conventional prompt-response paradigm, while RL requires the design of effective reward signals. Given the structured nature of scene graphs, we design a graph-centric reward function that integrates node-level rewards, edge-level rewards, and a format consistency reward. Our experiments demonstrate that rule-based RL substantially enhances model performance in the SGG task, achieving a zero failure rate--unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize effectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/gpt4vision/R1-SGG.</p></details> |  |

However, their nonlinear and hysteretic behavior, resulting from the properties of soft materials, presents substantial challenges for accurate modeling and control. In this study, we present a soft robotic system designed for surgical applications and propose a hysteresis-aware whole-body neural network model that accurately captures and predicts the soft robot's whole-body motion, including its hysteretic behavior. Building upon the high-precision dynamic model, we construct a highly parallel simulation environment for soft robot control and apply an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm to efficiently train whole-body motion control strategies. Based on the trained control policy, we developed a soft robotic system for surgical applications and validated it through phantom-based laser ablation experiments in a physical environment. The results demonstrate that the hysteresis-aware modeling reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 84.95 percent compared to traditional modeling methods. The deployed control algorithm achieved a trajectory tracking error ranging from 0.126 to 0.250 mm on the real soft robot, highlighting its precision in real-world conditions. The proposed method showed strong performance in phantom-based surgical experiments and demonstrates its potential for complex scenarios, including future real-world clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Reward-Free Reinforcement Learning Framework for Vehicle Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15262v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning plays a crucial role in vehicle control by guiding agents to learn optimal control strategies through designing or learning appropriate reward signals. However, in vehicle control applications, rewards typically need to be manually designed while considering multiple implicit factors, which easily introduces human biases. Although imitation learning methods does not rely on explicit reward signals, they necessitate high-quality expert actions, which are often challenging to acquire. To address these issues, we propose a reward-free reinforcement learning framework (RFRLF). This framework directly learns the target states to optimize agent behavior through a target state prediction network (TSPN) and a reward-free state-guided policy network (RFSGPN), avoiding the dependence on manually designed reward signals. Specifically, the policy network is learned via minimizing the differences between the predicted state and the expert state. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RFRLF in controlling vehicle driving, showing its advantages in improving learning efficiency and adapting to reward-free environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task Assignment and Exploration Optimization for Low Altitude UAV Rescue via Generative AI Enhanced Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13554v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven convolutional neural networks enhance rescue, inspection, and surveillance tasks performed by low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground computing nodes (GCNs) in unknown environments. However, their high computational demands often exceed a single UAV's capacity, leading to system instability, further exacerbated by the limited and dynamic resources of GCNs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel cooperation framework involving UAVs, ground-embedded robots (GERs), and high-altitude platforms (HAPs), which enable resource pooling through UAV-to-GER (U2G) and UAV-to-HAP (U2H) communications to provide computing services for UAV offloaded tasks. Specifically, we formulate the multi-objective optimization problem of task assignment and exploration optimization in UAVs as a dynamic long-term optimization problem. Our objective is to minimize task completion time and energy consumption while ensuring system stability over time. To achieve this, we first employ the Lyapunov optimization technique to transform the original problem, with stability constraints, into a per-slot deterministic problem. We then propose an algorithm named HG-MADDPG, which combines the Hungarian algorithm with a generative diffusion model (GDM)-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach. We first introduce the Hungarian algorithm as a method for exploration area selection, enhancing UAV efficiency in interacting with the environment. We then innovatively integrate the GDM and multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to optimize task assignment decisions, such as task offloading and resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant improvements in task offloading efficiency, latency reduction, and system stability compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[SwitchMT: An Adaptive Context Switching Methodology for Scalable Multi-Task Learning in Intelligent Autonomous Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13541v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to train intelligent autonomous agents (such as mobile robots) on multiple tasks is crucial for adapting to dynamic real-world environments. However, state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods only excel in single-task settings, and still struggle to generalize across multiple tasks due to task interference. Moreover, real-world environments also demand the agents to have data stream processing capabilities. Toward this, a state-of-the-art work employs Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to improve multi-task learning by exploiting temporal information in data stream, while enabling lowpower/energy event-based operations. However, it relies on fixed context/task-switching intervals during its training, hence limiting the scalability and effectiveness of multi-task learning. To address these limitations, we propose SwitchMT, a novel adaptive task-switching methodology for RL-based multi-task learning in autonomous agents. Specifically, SwitchMT employs the following key ideas: (1) a Deep Spiking Q-Network with active dendrites and dueling structure, that utilizes task-specific context signals to create specialized sub-networks; and (2) an adaptive task-switching policy that leverages both rewards and internal dynamics of the network parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that SwitchMT achieves superior performance in multi-task learning compared to state-of-the-art methods. It achieves competitive scores in multiple Atari games (i.e., Pong: -8.8, Breakout: 5.6, and Enduro: 355.2) compared to the state-of-the-art, showing its better generalized learning capability.

| **[PathVLM-R1: A Reinforcement Learning-Driven Reasoning Model for Pathology Visual-Language Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09258v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diagnosis of pathological images is often limited by expert availability and regional disparities, highlighting the importance of automated diagnosis using Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Traditional multimodal models typically emphasize outcomes over the reasoning process, compromising the reliability of clinical decisions. To address the weak reasoning abilities and lack of supervised processes in pathological VLMs, we have innovatively proposed PathVLM-R1, a visual language model designed specifically for pathological images. We have based our model on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and enhanced its performance for pathological tasks through meticulously designed post-training strategies. Firstly, we conduct supervised fine-tuning guided by pathological data to imbue the model with foundational pathological knowledge, forming a new pathological base model. Subsequently, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and propose a dual reward-driven reinforcement learning optimization, ensuring strict constraint on logical supervision of the reasoning process and accuracy of results via cross-modal process reward and outcome accuracy reward. In the pathological image question-answering tasks, the testing results of PathVLM-R1 demonstrate a 14% improvement in accuracy compared to baseline methods, and it demonstrated superior performance compared to the Qwen2.5-VL-32B version despite having a significantly smaller parameter size. Furthermore, in out-domain data evaluation involving four medical imaging modalities: Computed Tomography (CT), dermoscopy, fundus photography, and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images: PathVLM-R1's transfer performance improved by an average of 17.3% compared to traditional SFT methods. These results clearly indicate that PathVLM-R1 not only enhances accuracy but also possesses broad applicability and expansion potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prejudge-Before-Think: Enhancing Large Language Models at Test-Time by Process Prejudge Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13500v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a new \emph{process prejudge} strategy in LLM reasoning to demonstrate that bootstrapping with process prejudge allows the LLM to adaptively anticipate the errors encountered when advancing the subsequent reasoning steps, similar to people sometimes pausing to think about what mistakes may occur and how to avoid them, rather than relying solely on trial and error. Specifically, we define a prejudge node in the rationale, which represents a reasoning step, with at least one step that follows the prejudge node that has no paths toward the correct answer. To synthesize the prejudge reasoning process, we present an automated reasoning framework with a dynamic tree-searching strategy. This framework requires only one LLM to perform answer judging, response critiquing, prejudge generation, and thought completion. Furthermore, we develop a two-phase training mechanism with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to further enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results from competition-level complex reasoning demonstrate that our method can teach the model to prejudge before thinking and significantly enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs. Code and data is released at https://github.com/wjn1996/Prejudge-Before-Think.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-cultural Deployment of Autonomous Vehicles Using Data-light Inverse Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11506v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>More than the adherence to specific traffic regulations, driving culture touches upon a more implicit part - an informal, conventional, collective behavioral pattern followed by drivers - that varies across countries, regions, and even cities. Such cultural divergence has become one of the biggest challenges in deploying autonomous vehicles (AVs) across diverse regions today. The current emergence of data-driven methods has shown a potential solution to enable culture-compatible driving through learning from data, but what if some underdeveloped regions cannot provide sufficient local data to inform driving culture? This issue is particularly significant for a broader global AV market. Here, we propose a cross-cultural deployment scheme for AVs, called data-light inverse reinforcement learning, designed to re-calibrate culture-specific AVs and assimilate them into other cultures. First, we report the divergence in driving cultures through a comprehensive comparative analysis of naturalistic driving datasets on highways from three countries: Germany, China, and the USA. Then, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme by testing the expeditious cross-cultural deployment across these three countries, with cumulative testing mileage of over 56084 km. The performance is particularly advantageous when cross-cultural deployment is carried out without affluent local data. Results show that we can reduce the dependence on local data by a margin of 98.67% at best. This study is expected to bring a broader, fairer AV global market, particularly in those regions that lack enough local data to develop culture-compatible AVs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Sequential Recommenders through Counterfactual Augmentation of System Exposure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13482v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In sequential recommendation (SR), system exposure refers to items that are exposed to the user. Typically, only a few of the exposed items would be interacted with by the user. Although SR has achieved great success in predicting future user interests, existing SR methods still fail to fully exploit system exposure data. Most methods only model items that have been interacted with, while the large volume of exposed but non-interacted items is overlooked. Even methods that consider the whole system exposure typically train the recommender using only the logged historical system exposure, without exploring unseen user interests. In this paper, we propose counterfactual augmentation over system exposure for sequential recommendation (CaseRec). To better model historical system exposure, CaseRec introduces reinforcement learning to account for different exposure rewards. CaseRec uses a decision transformer-based sequential model to take an exposure sequence as input and assigns different rewards according to the user feedback. To further explore unseen user interests, CaseRec proposes to perform counterfactual augmentation, where exposed original items are replaced with counterfactual items. Then, a transformer-based user simulator is proposed to predict the user feedback reward for the augmented items. Augmentation, together with the user simulator, constructs counterfactual exposure sequences to uncover new user interests. Finally, CaseRec jointly uses the logged exposure sequences with the counterfactual exposure sequences to train a decision transformer-based sequential model for generating recommendation. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show the effectiveness of CaseRec. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZiqiZhao1/CaseRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at SIGIR 2025 (Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval)</p></details> |
| **[From Large to Super-Tiny: End-to-End Optimization for Cost-Efficient LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13471v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by optimizing traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines, improving performance and generalization. This has spurred their integration into various systems. Many NLP systems, including ours, employ a "one-stage" pipeline directly incorporating LLMs. While effective, this approach incurs substantial costs and latency due to the need for large model parameters to achieve satisfactory outcomes. This paper introduces a three-stage cost-efficient end-to-end LLM deployment pipeline-including prototyping, knowledge transfer, and model compression-to tackle the cost-performance dilemma in LLM-based frameworks. Our approach yields a super tiny model optimized for cost and performance in online systems, simplifying the system architecture. Initially, by transforming complex tasks into a function call-based LLM-driven pipeline, an optimal performance prototype system is constructed to produce high-quality data as a teacher model. The second stage combine techniques like rejection fine-tuning, reinforcement learning and knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge to a smaller 0.5B student model, delivering effective performance at minimal cost. The final stage applies quantization and pruning to extremely compress model to 0.4B, achieving ultra-low latency and cost. The framework's modular design and cross-domain capabilities suggest potential applicability in other NLP areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backstepping Temporal Difference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09875v3)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy learning ability is an important feature of reinforcement learning (RL) for practical applications. However, even one of the most elementary RL algorithms, temporal-difference (TD) learning, is known to suffer form divergence issue when the off-policy scheme is used together with linear function approximation. To overcome the divergent behavior, several off-policy TD-learning algorithms, including gradient-TD learning (GTD), and TD-learning with correction (TDC), have been developed until now. In this work, we provide a unified view of such algorithms from a purely control-theoretic perspective, and propose a new convergent algorithm. Our method relies on the backstepping technique, which is widely used in nonlinear control theory. Finally, convergence of the proposed algorithm is experimentally verified in environments where the standard TD-learning is known to be unstable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR2023</p></details> |

While recent works equip reinforcement learning (RL)-based LRMs with retrieval capabilities, they suffer from overthinking and lack robustness in reasoning, reducing their effectiveness in question answering (QA) tasks. To address this, we propose ReaRAG, a factuality-enhanced reasoning model that explores diverse queries without excessive iterations. Our solution includes a novel data construction framework with an upper bound on the reasoning chain length. Specifically, we first leverage an LRM to generate deliberate thinking, then select an action from a predefined action space (Search and Finish). For Search action, a query is executed against the RAG engine, where the result is returned as observation to guide reasoning steps later. This process iterates until a Finish action is chosen. Benefiting from ReaRAG's strong reasoning capabilities, our approach outperforms existing baselines on multi-hop QA. Further analysis highlights its strong reflective ability to recognize errors and refine its reasoning trajectory. Our study enhances LRMs' factuality while effectively integrating robust reasoning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey of Mixture-of-Experts: Algorithms, Theory, and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07137v3)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved astonishing successes in many domains, especially with the recent breakthroughs in the development of foundational large models. These large models, leveraging their extensive training data, provide versatile solutions for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, as modern datasets become increasingly diverse and complex, the development of large AI models faces two major challenges: (1) the enormous consumption of computational resources and deployment difficulties, and (2) the difficulty in fitting heterogeneous and complex data, which limits the usability of the models. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models has recently attracted much attention in addressing these challenges, by dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant sub-models to process input data. It has been shown that MoEs can significantly improve model performance and efficiency with fewer resources, particularly excelling in handling large-scale, multimodal data. Given the tremendous potential MoE has demonstrated across various domains, it is urgent to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advancements of MoEs in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE have their limitations, e.g., being outdated or lacking discussion on certain key areas, and we aim to address these gaps. In this paper, we first introduce the basic design of MoE, including gating functions, expert networks, routing mechanisms, training strategies, and system design. We then explore the algorithm design of MoE in important machine learning paradigms such as continual learning, meta-learning, multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, we summarize theoretical studies aimed at understanding MoE and review its applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions.</p></details> | 29 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Decentralized Handover Parameter Optimization with MARL for Load Balancing in 5G Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13424v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cellular networks, cell handover refers to the process where a device switches from one base station to another, and this mechanism is crucial for balancing the load among different cells. Traditionally, engineers would manually adjust parameters based on experience. However, the explosive growth in the number of cells has rendered manual tuning impractical. Existing research tends to overlook critical engineering details in order to simplify handover problems. In this paper, we classify cell handover into three types, and jointly model their mutual influence. To achieve load balancing, we propose a multi-agent-reinforcement-learning (MARL)-based scheme to automatically optimize the parameters. To reduce the agent interaction costs, a distributed training is implemented based on consensus approximation of global average load, and it is shown that the approximation error is bounded. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme outperforms existing benchmarks in balancing load and improving network performance.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

In healthcare, applying RL algorithms could assist patients in improving their health status. In ride-sharing platforms, applying RL algorithms could increase drivers' income and customer satisfaction. For large language models, applying RL algorithms could align their outputs with human preferences. Over the past decade, RL has been arguably one of the most vibrant research frontiers in machine learning. Nevertheless, statistics as a field, as opposed to computer science, has only recently begun to engage with RL both in depth and in breadth. This chapter presents a selective review of statistical inferential tools for RL, covering both hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction. Our goal is to highlight the value of statistical inference in RL for both the statistics and machine learning communities, and to promote the broader application of classical statistical inference tools in this vibrant area of research.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Optimal Discriminator Weighted Imitation Perspective for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13368v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Iterative Dual Reinforcement Learning (IDRL), a new method that takes an optimal discriminator-weighted imitation view of solving RL. Our method is motivated by a simple experiment in which we find training a discriminator using the offline dataset plus an additional expert dataset and then performing discriminator-weighted behavior cloning gives strong results on various types of datasets. That optimal discriminator weight is quite similar to the learned visitation distribution ratio in Dual-RL, however, we find that current Dual-RL methods do not correctly estimate that ratio. In IDRL, we propose a correction method to iteratively approach the optimal visitation distribution ratio in the offline dataset given no addtional expert dataset. During each iteration, IDRL removes zero-weight suboptimal transitions using the learned ratio from the previous iteration and runs Dual-RL on the remaining subdataset. This can be seen as replacing the behavior visitation distribution with the optimized visitation distribution from the previous iteration, which theoretically gives a curriculum of improved visitation distribution ratios that are closer to the optimal discriminator weight. We verify the effectiveness of IDRL on various kinds of offline datasets, including D4RL datasets and more realistic corrupted demonstrations. IDRL beats strong Primal-RL and Dual-RL baselines in terms of both performance and stability, on all datasets.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Here we compare their capabilities when used in permutation invariant neural networks for reinforcement learning (RL), with machine learning algorithms based on Transformers, such as ChatGPT. Transformers are based on the long standing conception of integrate-and-fire 'point' neurons, whereas Cooperator is inspired by recent neurobiological breakthroughs suggesting that the cellular foundations of mental life depend on context-sensitive pyramidal neurons in the neocortex which have two functionally distinct points. Weshow that when used for RL, an algorithm based on Cooperator learns far quicker than that based on Transformer, even while having the same number of parameters.</p></details> |  |

It tackles the problem of intermediate state estimation when external localization is unavailable or in the event of a sensor outage. The proposed observer comprises two nonlinear observers based on a recently developed iteratively preconditioned gradient descent (IPG) algorithm. It takes the inputs via an IMU preintegration model where the first observer is a quaternion-based IPG. The output for the first observer is the input for the second observer, estimating the velocity and, consequently, the position. The proposed observer is validated on a public underwater dataset and a real-world experiment using our robot platform. The estimation is compared with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF). Results demonstrate that our method outperforms these methods regarding better positional accuracy and lower variance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2025 (International Conference on Robotics and Automation), Atlanta, USA</p></details> |

Safety is critical in performing satellite maintenance, so the control techniques utilized must be trusted in addition to being highly efficient. In this work, Genetic Fuzzy Trees are combined with the widely used LQR control scheme via Thales' TrUE AI Toolkit to create a trusted and efficient controller for a two-degree-of-freedom planar robotic manipulator that would theoretically be used to perform satellite maintenance.

Recent advancements in low-cost teleoperation devices and VR/AR technologies have expanded accessibility, particularly for bimanual robot manipulators. However, transitioning from in-person to remote teleoperation presents challenges in task performance. We introduce SPARK, a kinematically scaled, low-cost teleoperation system for operating bimanual robots. Its effectiveness is compared to existing technologies like the 3D SpaceMouse and VR/AR controllers. We further extend SPARK to SPARK-Remote, integrating sensor-based force feedback using haptic gloves and a force controller for remote teleoperation. We evaluate SPARK and SPARK-Remote variants on 5 bimanual manipulation tasks which feature operational properties - positional precision, rotational precision, large movements in the workspace, and bimanual collaboration - to test the effective teleoperation modes. Our findings offer insights into improving low-cost teleoperation interfaces for real-world applications.

It can help significantly reduce the environmental impact of herbicides while reducing weed management costs for farmers. In this paper, we demonstrate that a custom-designed robotic spot spraying tool based on computer vision and deep learning can significantly reduce herbicide usage on sugarcane farms. We present results from field trials that compare robotic spot spraying against industry-standard broadcast spraying, by measuring the weed control efficacy, the reduction in herbicide usage, and the water quality improvements in irrigation runoff. The average results across 25 hectares of field trials show that spot spraying on sugarcane farms is 97\% as effective as broadcast spraying and reduces herbicide usage by 35\%, proportionally to the weed density. For specific trial strips with lower weed pressure, spot spraying reduced herbicide usage by up to 65\%. Water quality measurements of irrigation-induced runoff, three to six days after spraying, showed reductions in the mean concentration and mean load of herbicides of 39\% and 54\%, respectively, compared to broadcast spraying. These promising results reveal the capability of spot spraying technology to reduce herbicide usage on sugarcane farms without impacting weed control and potentially providing sustained water quality benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 17 figures, 4 tables.

However, most studies on these systems focus on planar motion planning without addressing rapid vertical motion. Despite their success on mild rugged terrains, recent field tests reveal a critical need for 3D behaviors (e.g., climbing or traversing tall obstacles). The challenges of 3D motion planning partially lie in designing sensing and control for a complex high-degree-of-freedom system, typically with over 25 degrees of freedom. To address the first challenge regarding sensing, we propose a tactile antenna system that enables the robot to probe obstacles to gather information about their structure. Building on this sensory input, we develop a control framework that integrates data from the antenna and foot contact sensors to dynamically adjust the robot's vertical body undulation for effective climbing. With the addition of simple, low-bandwidth tactile sensors, a robot with high static stability and redundancy exhibits predictable climbing performance in complex environments using a simple feedback controller. Laboratory and outdoor experiments demonstrate the robot's ability to climb obstacles up to five times its height. Moreover, the robot exhibits robust climbing capabilities on obstacles covered with shifting, robot-sized random items and those characterized by rapidly changing curvatures. These findings demonstrate an alternative solution to perceive the environment and facilitate effective response for legged robots, paving ways towards future highly capable, low-profile many-legged robots.</p></details> | Accepted by RSS 2025 |

Existing methods, including modular-based and end-to-end approaches, often lack robust spatial reasoning capabilities. Unlike recent point-based and flow-based affordance methods that focus on dense spatial representations or trajectory modeling, we propose A0, a hierarchical affordance-aware diffusion model that decomposes manipulation tasks into high-level spatial affordance understanding and low-level action execution. A0 leverages the Embodiment-Agnostic Affordance Representation, which captures object-centric spatial affordances by predicting contact points and post-contact trajectories. A0 is pre-trained on 1 million contact points data and fine-tuned on annotated trajectories, enabling generalization across platforms. Key components include Position Offset Attention for motion-aware feature extraction and a Spatial Information Aggregation Layer for precise coordinate mapping. The model's output is executed by the action execution module. Experiments on multiple robotic systems (Franka, Kinova, Realman, and Dobot) demonstrate A0's superior performance in complex tasks, showcasing its efficiency, flexibility, and real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe Autonomous Environmental Contact for Soft Robots using Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14755v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots built from soft materials will inherently apply lower environmental forces than their rigid counterparts, and therefore may be more suitable in sensitive settings with unintended contact. However, these robots' applied forces result from both their design and their control system in closed-loop, and therefore, ensuring bounds on these forces requires controller synthesis for safety as well. This article introduces the first feedback controller for a soft manipulator that formally meets a safety specification with respect to environmental contact. In our proof-of-concept setting, the robot's environment has known geometry and is deformable with a known elastic modulus. Our approach maps a bound on applied forces to a safe set of positions of the robot's tip via predicted deformations of the environment. Then, a quadratic program with Control Barrier Functions in its constraints is used to supervise a nominal feedback signal, verifiably maintaining the robot's tip within this safe set. Hardware experiments on a multi-segment soft pneumatic robot demonstrate that the proposed framework successfully constrains its environmental contact forces. This framework represents a fundamental shift in perspective on control and safety for soft robots, defining and implementing a formally verifiable logic specification on their pose and contact forces.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

Existing methods based on 3D Gaussians instead of dense voxels do not effectively exploit the geometry and opacity properties of Gaussians, which limits the network's estimation of complex environments and also limits the description of the scene by 3D Gaussians. In this paper, we propose a 3D occupancy prediction method which enhances the geometric and semantic scene understanding for robots, dubbed RoboOcc. It utilizes the Opacity-guided Self-Encoder (OSE) to alleviate the semantic ambiguity of overlapping Gaussians and the Geometry-aware Cross-Encoder (GCE) to accomplish the fine-grained geometric modeling of the surrounding scene. We conduct extensive experiments on Occ-ScanNet and EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet datasets, and our RoboOcc achieves state-of the-art performance in both local and global camera settings. Further, in ablation studies of Gaussian parameters, the proposed RoboOcc outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin of (8.47, 6.27) in IoU and mIoU metric, respectively. The codes will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

Multidimensional human motion data significantly deepen the understanding of the complex mechanisms governing neuromuscular alterations, thereby facilitating the development and application of rehabilitation robots in multifaceted real-world environments. However, currently available lower limb datasets are inadequate for supplying the essential multimodal data and large-scale gait samples necessary for effective data-driven approaches, and they neglect the significant effects of acquisition interference in real applications.To fill this gap, we present the K2MUSE dataset, which includes a comprehensive collection of multimodal data, comprising kinematic, kinetic, amplitude-mode ultrasound (AUS), and surface electromyography (sEMG) measurements. The proposed dataset includes lower limb multimodal data from 30 able-bodied participants walking under different inclines (0$^\circ$, $\pm$5$^\circ$, and $\pm$10$^\circ$), various speeds (0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s, and 1.5 m/s), and different nonideal acquisition conditions (muscle fatigue, electrode shifts, and inter-day differences). The kinematic and ground reaction force data were collected via a Vicon motion capture system and an instrumented treadmill with embedded force plates, whereas the sEMG and AUS data were synchronously recorded for thirteen muscles on the bilateral lower limbs. This dataset offers a new resource for designing control frameworks for rehabilitation robots and conducting biomechanical analyses of lower limb locomotion.

Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that empower robots with semantic reflection ability for failure, translating semantic reflection into how to correct fine-grained robotic actions remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we build the Phoenix framework, which leverages motion instruction as a bridge to connect high-level semantic reflection with low-level robotic action correction. In this motion-based self-reflection framework, we start with a dual-process motion adjustment mechanism with MLLMs to translate the semantic reflection into coarse-grained motion instruction adjustment. To leverage this motion instruction for guiding how to correct fine-grained robotic actions, a multi-task motion-conditioned diffusion policy is proposed to integrate visual observations for high-frequency robotic action correction. By combining these two models, we could shift the demand for generalization capability from the low-level manipulation policy to the MLLMs-driven motion adjustment model and facilitate precise, fine-grained robotic action correction. Utilizing this framework, we further develop a lifelong learning method to automatically improve the model's capability from interactions with dynamic environments. The experiments conducted in both the RoboMimic simulation and real-world scenarios prove the superior generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation tasks. Our code is released at \href{https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/Motion-based-Self-Reflection-Framework}{https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/Motion-based-Self-Reflection-Framework}.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

To improve the learning experience and the resulting understanding of vectors, we propose to investigate how concreteness fading implemented with the use of augmented reality and tangible robots could help learners to build a strong representation of vector addition. We design a gamified learning environment consisting of three concreteness fading stages and conduct an experiment with 30 participants. Our results shows a positive learning gain. We analyze extensively the behavior of the participants to understand the usage of the technological tools -- augmented reality and tangible robots -- during the learning scenario.

| **[Experience-based Refinement of Task Planning Knowledge in Autonomous Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14259v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The requirement for autonomous robots to exhibit higher-level cognitive skills by planning and adapting in an ever-changing environment is indeed a great challenge for the AI community. Progress has been made in the automated planning community on refinement and repair of an agent's symbolic knowledge to do task planning in an incomplete or changing environmental model, but these advances up to now have not been transferred to real physical robots. This paper demonstrates how a physical robot can be capable of adapting its symbolic knowledge of the environment, by using experiences in robot action execution to drive knowledge refinement and hence to improve the success rate of the task plans the robot creates. To implement more robust planning systems, we propose a method for refining domain knowledge to improve the knowledge on which intelligent robot behavior is based. This architecture has been implemented and evaluated using a NAO robot. The refined knowledge leads to the future synthesis of task plans which demonstrate decreasing rates of failure over time as faulty knowledge is removed or adjusted.</p></details> |  |

These physical `gliders' robustly emerge from an ensemble of individually undulating three-link two-motor robots and can remain bound for hundreds of undulations and travel for multiple robot dimensions. Gliders occur in two distinct binding symmetries and form over a wide range of angular oscillation extent. This parameter sets the maximal concavity which influences formation probability and translation characteristics. Analysis of dynamics in simulation reveals the mechanism of effective dynamical attraction -- a result of the emergent interplay of appropriately oriented and timed repulsive interactions.

A flexible spine enables undulation of the body through a wavelike motion along the spine, aiding navigation over uneven terrains and obstacles. Yet environmental uncertainties, such as surface irregularities and variations in friction, can significantly disrupt body-limb coordination and cause discrepancies between predictions from mathematical models and real-world outcomes. Addressing this challenge requires the development of sophisticated control strategies capable of dynamically adapting to uncertain conditions while maintaining efficient locomotion. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a promising framework for handling non-deterministic environments and enabling robotic systems to adapt effectively and perform robustly under challenging conditions. In this study, we comparatively examine learning-based control strategies and biologically inspired gait design methods on a salamander-like robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been accepted for presentation at the Mechanical Intelligence in Robotics workshop at ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Relevance-driven Decision Making for Safer and More Efficient Human Robot Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13998v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human brain possesses the ability to effectively focus on important environmental components, which enhances perception, learning, reasoning, and decision-making. Inspired by this cognitive mechanism, we introduced a novel concept termed relevance for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). Relevance is a dimensionality reduction process that incorporates a continuously operating perception module, evaluates cue sufficiency within the scene, and applies a flexible formulation and computation framework. In this paper, we present an enhanced two-loop framework that integrates real-time and asynchronous processing to quantify relevance and leverage it for safer and more efficient human-robot collaboration (HRC). The two-loop framework integrates an asynchronous loop, which leverages LLM world knowledge to quantify relevance, and a real-time loop, which performs scene understanding, human intent prediction, and decision-making based on relevance. HRC decision-making is enhanced by a relevance-based task allocation method, as well as a motion generation and collision avoidance approach that incorporates human trajectory prediction. Simulations and experiments show that our methodology for relevance quantification can accurately and robustly predict the human objective and relevance, with an average accuracy of up to 0.90 for objective prediction and up to 0.96 for relevance prediction. Moreover, our motion generation methodology reduces collision cases by 63.76% and collision frames by 44.74% when compared with a state-of-the-art (SOTA) collision avoidance method. Our framework and methodologies, with relevance, guide the robot on how to best assist humans and generate safer and more efficient actions for HRC.</p></details> |  |

This research bridges the gap between textile production and robotic automation by proposing a novel deep learning-based pipeline for reverse knitting to integrate vision-based robotic systems into textile manufacturing. The pipeline employs a two-stage architecture, enabling robots to first identify front labels before inferring complete labels, ensuring accurate, scalable pattern generation. By incorporating diverse yarn structures, including single-yarn (sj) and multi-yarn (mj) patterns, this study demonstrates how our system can adapt to varying material complexities. Critical challenges in robotic textile manipulation, such as label imbalance, underrepresented stitch types, and the need for fine-grained control, are addressed by leveraging specialized deep-learning architectures. This work establishes a foundation for fully automated robotic knitting systems, enabling customizable, flexible production processes that integrate perception, planning, and actuation, thereby advancing textile manufacturing through intelligent robotic automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Green Robotic Mixed Reality with Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13697v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realizing green communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images at high frequencies through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR (GSRMR), which achieves a lower energy consumption and makes a concrete step towards green RoboMR. The crux to GSRMR is to build a GS model which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a photo-realistic view from the robot's pose, thereby reducing the need for excessive image uploads. Since the GS model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or not) and power allocation across different frames. The GSCLO problem is solved by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSRMR reduces the communication energy by over 10x compared with RoboMR. Furthermore, the proposed GSRMR with APO outperforms extensive baseline schemes, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, accepted by IEEE INFOCOM 2025 Workshop on Networked Robotics and Communication Systems</p></details> |

This paper describes the quadrupedal climbing robot Magnecko, developed with the major goal of providing a research platform for legged climbing locomotion.

| **[Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments using Acceleration Obstacles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13637v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the issue of motion planning in dynamic environments by extending the concept of Velocity Obstacle and Nonlinear Velocity Obstacle to Acceleration Obstacle AO and Nonlinear Acceleration Obstacle NAO. Similarly to VO and NLVO, the AO and NAO represent the set of colliding constant accelerations of the maneuvering robot with obstacles moving along linear and nonlinear trajectories, respectively. Contrary to prior works, we derive analytically the exact boundaries of AO and NAO. To enhance an intuitive understanding of these representations, we first derive the AO in several steps: first extending the VO to the Basic Acceleration Obstacle BAO that consists of the set of constant accelerations of the robot that would collide with an obstacle moving at constant accelerations, while assuming zero initial velocities of the robot and obstacle. This is then extended to the AO while assuming arbitrary initial velocities of the robot and obstacle. And finally, we derive the NAO that in addition to the prior assumptions, accounts for obstacles moving along arbitrary trajectories. The introduction of NAO allows the generation of safe avoidance maneuvers that directly account for the robot's second-order dynamics, with acceleration as its control input. The AO and NAO are demonstrated in several examples of selecting avoidance maneuvers in challenging road traffic. It is shown that the use of NAO drastically reduces the adjustment rate of the maneuvering robot's acceleration while moving in complex road traffic scenarios. The presented approach enables reactive and efficient navigation for multiple robots, with potential application for autonomous vehicles operating in complex dynamic environments.</p></details> | 6 pages, 13 figures |
| **[On the Importance of Tactile Sensing for Imitation Learning: A Case Study on Robotic Match Lighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13618v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of robotic manipulation has advanced significantly in the last years. At the sensing level, several novel tactile sensors have been developed, capable of providing accurate contact information. On a methodological level, learning from demonstrations has proven an efficient paradigm to obtain performant robotic manipulation policies. The combination of both holds the promise to extract crucial contact-related information from the demonstration data and actively exploit it during policy rollouts. However, despite its potential, it remains an underexplored direction. This work therefore proposes a multimodal, visuotactile imitation learning framework capable of efficiently learning fast and dexterous manipulation policies. We evaluate our framework on the dynamic, contact-rich task of robotic match lighting - a task in which tactile feedback influences human manipulation performance. The experimental results show that adding tactile information into the policies significantly improves performance by over 40%, thereby underlining the importance of tactile sensing for contact-rich manipulation tasks.

| **[Hysteresis-Aware Neural Network Modeling and Whole-Body Reinforcement Learning Control of Soft Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13582v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots exhibit inherent compliance and safety, which makes them particularly suitable for applications requiring direct physical interaction with humans, such as surgical procedures. However, their nonlinear and hysteretic behavior, resulting from the properties of soft materials, presents substantial challenges for accurate modeling and control. In this study, we present a soft robotic system designed for surgical applications and propose a hysteresis-aware whole-body neural network model that accurately captures and predicts the soft robot's whole-body motion, including its hysteretic behavior. Building upon the high-precision dynamic model, we construct a highly parallel simulation environment for soft robot control and apply an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm to efficiently train whole-body motion control strategies. Based on the trained control policy, we developed a soft robotic system for surgical applications and validated it through phantom-based laser ablation experiments in a physical environment. The results demonstrate that the hysteresis-aware modeling reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 84.95 percent compared to traditional modeling methods. The deployed control algorithm achieved a trajectory tracking error ranging from 0.126 to 0.250 mm on the real soft robot, highlighting its precision in real-world conditions. The proposed method showed strong performance in phantom-based surgical experiments and demonstrates its potential for complex scenarios, including future real-world clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Robotic Skill Acquisition From a Suboptimal Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03131v4)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has emerged as a crucial method for robots to acquire new skills. However, when given suboptimal task trajectory demonstrations with shape characteristics reflecting human preferences but subpar dynamic attributes such as slow motion, robots not only need to mimic the behaviors but also optimize the dynamic performance. In this work, we leverage optimization-based methods to search for a superior-performing trajectory whose shape is similar to that of the demonstrated trajectory. Specifically, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to quantify the difference between two trajectories and combine it with additional performance metrics, such as collision cost, to construct the cost function. Moreover, we develop a multi-policy version of the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP), called MSTOMP, which is more stable and robust to parameter changes. To deal with the jitter in the demonstrated trajectory, we further utilize the gain-controlling method in the frequency domain to denoise the demonstration and propose a computationally more efficient metric, called Mean Square Error in the Spectrum (MSES), that measures the trajectories' differences in the frequency domain. We also theoretically highlight the connections between the time domain and the frequency domain methods. Finally, we verify our method in both simulation experiments and real-world experiments, showcasing its improved optimization performance and stability compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integration of a Graph-Based Path Planner and Mixed-Integer MPC for Robot Navigation in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13372v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to update a path plan is a required capability for autonomous mobile robots navigating through uncertain environments. This paper proposes a re-planning strategy using a multilayer planning and control framework for cases where the robot's environment is partially known. A medial axis graph-based planner defines a global path plan based on known obstacles where each edge in the graph corresponds to a unique corridor. A mixed-integer model predictive control (MPC) method detects if a terminal constraint derived from the global plan is infeasible, subject to a non-convex description of the local environment. Infeasibility detection is used to trigger efficient global re-planning via medial axis graph edge deletion. The proposed re-planning strategy is demonstrated experimentally.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long Range Navigator (LRN): Extending robot planning horizons beyond metric maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13149v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A robot navigating an outdoor environment with no prior knowledge of the space must rely on its local sensing to perceive its surroundings and plan. This can come in the form of a local metric map or local policy with some fixed horizon. Beyond that, there is a fog of unknown space marked with some fixed cost. A limited planning horizon can often result in myopic decisions leading the robot off course or worse, into very difficult terrain. Ideally, we would like the robot to have full knowledge that can be orders of magnitude larger than a local cost map. In practice, this is intractable due to sparse sensing information and often computationally expensive. In this work, we make a key observation that long-range navigation only necessitates identifying good frontier directions for planning instead of full map knowledge. To this end, we propose Long Range Navigator (LRN), that learns an intermediate affordance representation mapping high-dimensional camera images to `affordable' frontiers for planning, and then optimizing for maximum alignment with the desired goal. LRN notably is trained entirely on unlabeled ego-centric videos making it easy to scale and adapt to new platforms. Through extensive off-road experiments on Spot and a Big Vehicle, we find that augmenting existing navigation stacks with LRN reduces human interventions at test-time and leads to faster decision making indicating the relevance of LRN. https://personalrobotics.github.io/lrn</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Learning Diverse Robot Striking Motions with Diffusion Models and Kinematically Constrained Gradient Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15528v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in robot learning have enabled robots to generate skills for a variety of tasks. Yet, robot learning is typically sample inefficient, struggles to learn from data sources exhibiting varied behaviors, and does not naturally incorporate constraints. These properties are critical for fast, agile tasks such as playing table tennis. Modern techniques for learning from demonstration improve sample efficiency and scale to diverse data, but are rarely evaluated on agile tasks. In the case of reinforcement learning, achieving good performance requires training on high-fidelity simulators. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel diffusion modeling approach that is offline, constraint-guided, and expressive of diverse agile behaviors. The key to our approach is a kinematic constraint gradient guidance (KCGG) technique that computes gradients through both the forward kinematics of the robot arm and the diffusion model to direct the sampling process. KCGG minimizes the cost of violating constraints while simultaneously keeping the sampled trajectory in-distribution of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for time-critical robotic tasks by evaluating KCGG in two challenging domains: simulated air hockey and real table tennis. In simulated air hockey, we achieved a 25.4% increase in block rate, while in table tennis, we saw a 17.3% increase in success rate compared to imitation learning baselines.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

Our approach incorporates a continuously operating perception module, evaluates cue sufficiency within the scene, and applies a flexible formulation and computation framework. To accurately and efficiently quantify relevance, we developed an event-based framework that maintains a continuous perception of the scene and selectively triggers relevance determination. Within this framework, we developed a probabilistic methodology, which considers various factors and is built on a novel structured scene representation. Simulation results demonstrate that the relevance framework and methodology accurately predict the relevance of a general HRC setup, achieving a precision of 0.99, a recall of 0.94, an F1 score of 0.96, and an object ratio of 0.94. Relevance can be broadly applied to several areas in HRC to accurately improve task planning time by 79.56% compared with pure planning for a cereal task, reduce perception latency by up to 26.53% for an object detector, improve HRC safety by up to 13.50% and reduce the number of inquiries for HRC by 80.84%. A real-world demonstration showcases the relevance framework's ability to intelligently and seamlessly assist humans in everyday tasks.</p></details> | under review |

However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality demonstration data and real-world-aligned evaluation benchmarks severely limits such development. To address this, we introduce RoboTwin, a generative digital twin framework that uses 3D generative foundation models and large language models to produce diverse expert datasets and provide a real-world-aligned evaluation platform for dual-arm robotic tasks. Specifically, RoboTwin creates varied digital twins of objects from single 2D images, generating realistic and interactive scenarios.

We accomplish this by exploiting guidance about a problem's structure to limit exploration of the planning space and through modifying DaSH's conflict resolution scheme.

These LTL-encoded tasks require robots to apply their skills to specific regions and objects in a temporal and logical order. While existing temporal logic planning algorithms can synthesize correct-by-construction plans, they typically lack reactivity to unexpected failures of robot skills, which can compromise mission performance. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a reactive LTL planning algorithm that adapts to unexpected failures during deployment. Specifically, the proposed algorithm reassigns sub-tasks to robots based on their functioning skills and locally revises team plans to accommodate these new assignments and ensure mission completion. The main novelty of the proposed algorithm is its ability to handle cases where mission completion becomes impossible due to limited functioning robots. Instead of reporting mission failure, the algorithm strategically prioritizes the most crucial sub-tasks and locally revises the team's plans, as per user-specified priorities, to minimize mission violations. We provide theoretical conditions under which the proposed framework computes the minimum-violation task reassignments and team plans. We provide numerical and hardware experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

This design integrates the actuators within the hand while maintaining an anthropomorphic form. Each finger joint features a self-locking mechanism that allows the hand to sustain large external forces without active motor engagement. This approach shifts the payload limitation from the motor strength to the mechanical strength of the hand, allowing the use of smaller, more cost-effective motors. With 18 DoF and weighing only 790 grams, the Krysalis Hand delivers an active squeezing force of 10 N per finger and supports a passive payload capacity exceeding 10 lbs. These characteristics make Krysalis Hand one of the lightest, strongest, and most dexterous robotic end-effectors of its kind. Experimental evaluations validate its ability to perform intricate manipulation tasks and handle heavy payloads, underscoring its potential for industrial applications as well as academic research.

Results were derived from a multimodal analysis, including questionnaires, open-ended responses, and behavioral observations. This approach allowed us to validate the developed emotion generator and explore the relationship between the personality traits of Agreeableness, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and Empathy. Furthermore, we drew robust conclusions on how these traits influence relational trust, capability trust, enjoyability, and sociability.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

VBTSs have emerged as a promising solution, offering high spatial resolution and cost-effectiveness by sensing contact through camera-captured deformation patterns of elastic gel pads. However, these sensors' complex physical characteristics and visual signal processing requirements present unique challenges for robotic applications. The lack of efficient and accurate simulation tools for VBTS has significantly limited the scale and scope of tactile robotics research. Here we present Taccel, a high-performance simulation platform that integrates IPC and ABD to model robots, tactile sensors, and objects with both accuracy and unprecedented speed, achieving an 18-fold acceleration over real-time across thousands of parallel environments. Unlike previous simulators that operate at sub-real-time speeds with limited parallelization, Taccel provides precise physics simulation and realistic tactile signals while supporting flexible robot-sensor configurations through user-friendly APIs. Through extensive validation in object recognition, robotic grasping, and articulated object manipulation, we demonstrate precise simulation and successful sim-to-real transfer. These capabilities position Taccel as a powerful tool for scaling up tactile robotics research and development. By enabling large-scale simulation and experimentation with tactile sensing, Taccel accelerates the development of more capable robotic systems, potentially transforming how robots interact with and understand their physical environment.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

| **[Causality-enhanced Decision-Making for Autonomous Mobile Robots in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11901v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of robots in shared environments -- such as warehouses, shopping centres, and hospitals -- demands a deep understanding of the underlying dynamics and human behaviours, including how, when, and where individuals engage in various activities and interactions. This knowledge goes beyond simple correlation studies and requires a more comprehensive causal analysis. By leveraging causal inference to model cause-and-effect relationships, we can better anticipate critical environmental factors and enable autonomous robots to plan and execute tasks more effectively. To this end, we propose a novel causality-based decision-making framework that reasons over a learned causal model to predict battery usage and human obstructions, understanding how these factors could influence robot task execution. Such reasoning framework assists the robot in deciding when and how to complete a given task. To achieve this, we developed also PeopleFlow, a new Gazebo-based simulator designed to model context-sensitive human-robot spatial interactions in shared workspaces. PeopleFlow features realistic human and robot trajectories influenced by contextual factors such as time, environment layout, and robot state, and can simulate a large number of agents. While the simulator is general-purpose, in this paper we focus on a warehouse-like environment as a case study, where we conduct an extensive evaluation benchmarking our causal approach against a non-causal baseline. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solutions, highlighting how causal reasoning enables autonomous robots to operate more efficiently and safely in dynamic environments shared with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Causa...</summary><p>Causal Discovery and Inference - Robot Autonomy - Human-Robot Spatial Interaction - Decision-Making</p></details> |
| **[Embodied Neuromorphic Control Applied on a 7-DOF Robotic Manipulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12702v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of artificial intelligence towards real-time interaction with the environment is a key aspect of embodied intelligence and robotics. Inverse dynamics is a fundamental robotics problem, which maps from joint space to torque space of robotic systems. Traditional methods for solving it rely on direct physical modeling of robots which is difficult or even impossible due to nonlinearity and external disturbance. Recently, data-based model-learning algorithms are adopted to address this issue. However, they often require manual parameter tuning and high computational costs. Neuromorphic computing is inherently suitable to process spatiotemporal features in robot motion control at extremely low costs. However, current research is still in its infancy: existing works control only low-degree-of-freedom systems and lack performance quantification and comparison. In this paper, we propose a neuromorphic control framework to control 7 degree-of-freedom robotic manipulators. We use Spiking Neural Network to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity of the motion data to improve control accuracy, and eliminate manual parameters tuning. We validated the algorithm on two robotic platforms, which reduces torque prediction error by at least 60% and performs a target position tracking task successfully. This work advances embodied neuromorphic control by one step forward from proof of concept to applications in complex real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant advances in replicating human hand kinematics and control algorithms, robotic systems still struggle to match human capabilities in dynamic environments, primarily due to inadequate tactile feedback. To bridge this gap, we present F-TAC Hand, a biomimetic hand featuring high-resolution tactile sensing (0.1mm spatial resolution) across 70% of its surface area. Through optimized hand design, we overcome traditional challenges in integrating high-resolution tactile sensors while preserving the full range of motion. The hand, powered by our generative algorithm that synthesizes human-like hand configurations, demonstrates robust grasping capabilities in dynamic real-world conditions. Extensive evaluation across 600 real-world trials demonstrates that this tactile-embodied system significantly outperforms non-tactile-informed alternatives in complex manipulation tasks (p<0.0001). These results provide empirical evidence for the critical role of rich tactile embodiment in developing advanced robotic intelligence, offering new perspectives on the relationship between physical sensing capabilities and intelligent behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crossing the Human-Robot Embodiment Gap with Sim-to-Real RL using One Human Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12609v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching robots dexterous manipulation skills often requires collecting hundreds of demonstrations using wearables or teleoperation, a process that is challenging to scale. Videos of human-object interactions are easier to collect and scale, but leveraging them directly for robot learning is difficult due to the lack of explicit action labels from videos and morphological differences between robot and human hands. We propose Human2Sim2Robot, a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework for training dexterous manipulation policies using only one RGB-D video of a human demonstrating a task. Our method utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation to cross the human-robot embodiment gap without relying on wearables, teleoperation, or large-scale data collection typically necessary for imitation learning methods. From the demonstration, we extract two task-specific components: (1) the object pose trajectory to define an object-centric, embodiment-agnostic reward function, and (2) the pre-manipulation hand pose to initialize and guide exploration during RL training. We found that these two components are highly effective for learning the desired task, eliminating the need for task-specific reward shaping and tuning. We demonstrate that Human2Sim2Robot outperforms object-aware open-loop trajectory replay by 55% and imitation learning with data augmentation by 68% across grasping, non-prehensile manipulation, and multi-step tasks.

| **[A Centralized Planning and Distributed Execution Method for Shape Filling with Homogeneous Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22522v3)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pattern formation task is commonly seen in a multi-robot system. In this paper, we study the problem of forming complex shapes with functionally limited mobile robots, which have to rely on other robots to precisely locate themselves. The goal is to decide whether a given shape can be filled by a given set of robots; in case the answer is yes, to complete a shape formation process as fast as possible with a minimum amount of communication. Traditional approaches either require global coordinates for each robot or are prone to failure when attempting to form complex shapes beyond the capability of given approaches - the latter calls for a decision procedure that can tell whether a target shape can be formed before the actual shape-forming process starts. In this paper, we develop a method that does not require global coordinate information during the execution process and can effectively decide whether it is feasible to form the desired shape. The latter is achieved via a planning procedure that is capable of handling a variety of complex shapes, in particular, those with holes, and assigning a simple piece of scheduling information to each robot, facilitating subsequent distributed execution, which does not rely on the coordinates of all robots but only those of neighboring ones. The effectiveness of our shape-forming approach is vividly illustrated in several simulation case studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified World Models: Coupling Video and Action Diffusion for Pretraining on Large Robotic Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02792v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building generalist robots. However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation required for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. By simply controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

Controlling soft robots is challenging due to their nonlinear dynamics and the presence of time delays, especially in applications like a soft robotic arm for patient care. This paper presents a learning-based approach to approximate the nonlinear state predictor (Smith Predictor), aiming to improve tracking performance in a two-module soft robot arm with a short inherent input delay. The method uses Kernel Recursive Least Squares Tracker (KRLST) for online learning of the system dynamics and a Legendre Delay Network (LDN) to compress past input history for efficient delay compensation. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in tracking performance compared to a baseline model-based non-linear controller. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of the improvements. The method is computationally efficient and adaptable online, making it suitable for real-world scenarios and highlighting its potential for enabling safer and more accurate control of soft robots in assistive care applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality demonstration data and real-world-aligned evaluation benchmarks severely limits such development. To address this, we introduce RoboTwin, a generative digital twin framework that uses 3D generative foundation models and large language models to produce diverse expert datasets and provide a real-world-aligned evaluation platform for dual-arm robotic tasks. Specifically, RoboTwin creates varied digital twins of objects from single 2D images, generating realistic and interactive scenarios. It also introduces a spatial relation-aware code generation framework that combines object annotations with large language models to break down tasks, determine spatial constraints, and generate precise robotic movement code. Our framework offers a comprehensive benchmark with both simulated and real-world data, enabling standardized evaluation and better alignment between simulated training and real-world performance. We validated our approach using the open-source COBOT Magic Robot platform. Policies pre-trained on RoboTwin-generated data and fine-tuned with limited real-world samples improve the success rate of over 70% for single-arm tasks and over 40% for dual-arm tasks compared to models trained solely on real-world data. This significant improvement demonstrates RoboTwin's potential to enhance the development and evaluation of dual-arm robotic manipulation systems.

To assist surgeons achieve this level of accuracy, the Improved Integrated Robotic Intraocular Snake (I2RIS) with dexterous capability has been developed. However, such flexible tendon-driven robots often suffer from hysteresis problems, which significantly challenges precise control and positioning. In particular, we observed multi-stage hysteresis phenomena in the small-scale I2RIS. In this paper, we propose an Extended Generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii (EGPI) model to increase the fitting accuracy of the hysteresis. The model incorporates a novel switching mechanism that enables it to describe multi-stage hysteresis in the regions of monotonic input. Experimental validation on I2RIS data demonstrate that the EGPI model outperforms the conventional Generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii (GPI) model in terms of RMSE, NRMSE, and MAE across multiple motor input directions. The EGPI model in our study highlights the potential in modeling multi-stage hysteresis in minimally invasive flexible robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 5th Modeling, Estimation and Control Conference (MECC 2025)</p></details> |

However, deep learning-based models in robotics face significant challenges due to limited training data and highly noisy signal features. In this paper, we present Sparse Masked Autoregressive Flow-based Adversarial AutoEncoders model to address these problems. This approach integrates Masked Autoregressive Flow model into Adversarial AutoEncoders to construct a flexible latent space and utilize Sparse autoencoder to efficiently focus on important features, even in scenarios with limited feature space. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 4.96% to 9.75% higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for pick-and-place robotic operations with randomly placed cans, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it showed up to 19.67% better performance in scenarios involving collisions with lightweight objects. Additionally, unlike the existing state-of-the-art model, our model performs inferences within 1 millisecond, ensuring real-time anomaly detection. These capabilities make our model highly applicable to machine learning-based robotic safety systems in dynamic environments.

We conduct a comparative analysis on various approaches for sensing force, data collection, behavior cloning, tactile representation learning, and low-level robot control. From our analysis, we articulate when and why forces are needed, and highlight opportunities to improve learning of contact-rich, generalist robot policies on the path toward highly capable touch-based robot foundation models. We generally find that while there are few tasks such as pouring, peg-in-hole insertion, and handling delicate objects, the performance of imitation learning models is not at a level of dynamics where force truly matters. Also, force and touch are abstract quantities that can be inferred through a wide range of modalities and are often measured and controlled implicitly. We hope that juxtaposing the different approaches currently in use will help the reader to gain a systemic understanding and help inspire the next generation of robot foundation models.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

By introducing a best-shot prompting technique and a reinforcement learning-based control algorithm, RoboMorph iteratively improves robot designs through feedback loops. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboMorph successfully generates nontrivial robots optimized for different terrains while showcasing improvements in robot morphology over successive evolutions. Our approach highlights the potential of using LLMs for data-driven, modular robot design, providing a promising methodology that can be extended to other domains with similar design frameworks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing forward-facing camera systems often encounter challenges in dynamic environments and open spaces, leading to significant performance degradation during deployment. To address these limitations, a localization system utilizing a single downward-facing camera to capture ground textures presents a promising solution. Nevertheless, existing feature-based ground-texture localization methods face difficulties when operating on surfaces with sparse features or repetitive patterns. To address this limitation, we propose GroundSLAM, a novel feature-free and ground-texture-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. GroundSLAM consists of three components: feature-free visual odometry, ground-texture-based loop detection and map optimization, and map reuse. Specifically, we introduce a kernel cross-correlator (KCC) for image-level pose tracking, loop detection, and map reuse to improve localization accuracy and robustness, and incorporate adaptive pruning strategies to enhance efficiency. Due to these specific designs, GroundSLAM is able to deliver efficient and stable localization across various ground surfaces such as those with sparse features and repetitive patterns. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first ground-texture dataset with precise ground-truth poses, consisting of 131k images collected from 10 kinds of indoor and outdoor ground surfaces. Extensive experimental results show that GroundSLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both indoor and outdoor localization. We release our code and dataset at https://github.com/sair-lab/GroundSLAM.</p></details> |  |

Recently decentralized technologies such as smart contract and blockchain are being explored for applications in robotics. However, the limited transaction processing and high maintenance cost hinder the widespread adoption of such approaches. Moreover, blockchain transactions be they on public or private permissioned blockchain are publically readable which further fails to preserve the confidentiality of the robot's data and privacy of the robot. In this work, we propose RoboComm a Decentralized Identity based approach for privacy-preserving interaction between robots. With DID a component of Self-Sovereign Identity; robots can authenticate each other independently without relying on any third-party service. Verifiable Credentials enable private data associated with a robot to be stored within the robot's hardware, unlike existing blockchain based approaches where the data has to be on the blockchain. We improve throughput by allowing message exchange over state channels. Being a blockchain backed solution RoboComm provides a trustworthy system without relying on a single party.

However, to realize the swimming performance of biology, there is a need for soft robotic swimmers with both distributed muscles and kinematic feedback. This study presents the design and swimming performance of a soft robotic fish with independently controllable muscles and embedded kinematic sensing distributed along the body. The soft swimming robot consists of an interior flexible spine, three axially distributed sets of HASEL artificial muscles, embedded strain gauges, a streamlined silicone body, and off-board electronics. In a fixed configuration, the soft robot generates a maximum thrust of 7.9 mN when excited near its first resonant frequency (2 Hz) with synchronized antagonistic actuation of all muscles. When excited near its second resonant frequency (8 Hz), synchronized muscle actuation generates 5.0 mN of thrust. By introducing a sequential phase offset into the muscle actuation, the thrust at the second resonant frequency increases to 7.2 mN, a 44% increase from simple antagonistic activation. The sequential muscle activation improves the thrust by increasing 1) the tail-beat velocity and 2) traveling wave content in the swimming kinematics by four times. Further, the second resonant frequency (8 Hz) generates nearly as much thrust as the first resonance (2 Hz) while requiring only $\approx25$% of the tail displacement, indicating that higher resonant frequencies have benefits for swimming in confined environments where a smaller kinematic envelope is necessary. These results demonstrate the performance benefits of independently controllable muscles and distributed kinematic sensing, and this type of soft robotic swimmer provides a platform to address the open challenge of sensorimotor control.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

HER facilitates learning from failed attempts by replaying trajectories with redefined goals. However, it relies on a heuristic-based replay method that lacks a principled framework. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel replay strategy, "Next-Future", which focuses on rewarding single-step transitions. This approach significantly enhances sample efficiency and accuracy in learning multi-goal Markov decision processes (MDPs), particularly under stringent accuracy requirements -- a critical aspect for performing complex and precise robotic-arm tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by highlighting how single-step learning enables improved value approximation within the multi-goal RL framework. The performance of the proposed replay strategy is evaluated across eight challenging robotic manipulation tasks, using ten random seeds for training. Our results indicate substantial improvements in sample efficiency for seven out of eight tasks and higher success rates in six tasks. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the practical feasibility of the learned policies, demonstrating the potential of "Next-Future" in solving complex robotic-arm tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Through expert interviews and surveys, we identify and weigh key features contributing to R for wheeled robots on urban streets. Our findings reveal that pedestrian density, crowd dynamics and pedestrian flow are the most critical factors, collectively accounting for 28% of the total score. Computing robotability across New York City yields significant variation; the area of highest R is 3.0 times more "robotable" than the area of lowest R. Deployments of a physical robot on high and low robotability areas show the adequacy of the score in anticipating the ease of robot navigation.

While there is ongoing research on enabling camera calibration using natural images, many systems in practice still rely on using designated calibration targets with e.g. checkerboard patterns or April tag grids. Once calibration images from different perspectives have been acquired and feature descriptors detected, those are typically used in an optimization process to minimize the geometric reprojection error. For this optimization to converge, input images need to be of sufficient quality and particularly sharpness; they should neither contain motion blur nor rolling-shutter artifacts that can arise when the calibration board was not static during image capture. In this work, we present a novel calibration image acquisition technique controlled via voice commands recorded with a clip-on microphone, that can be more robust and user-friendly than e.g. triggering capture with a remote control, or filtering out blurry frames from a video sequence in postprocessing. To achieve this, we use a state-of-the-art speech-to-text transcription model with accurate per-word timestamping to capture trigger words with precise temporal alignment. Our experiments show that the proposed method improves user experience by being fast and efficient, allowing us to successfully calibrate complex multi-camera setups.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Existing works focus on developing complex and heavyweight planners while ignoring the role of human intelligence. Since humans are highly capable agents who are also widely available in a crowd navigation setting, we propose an alternative scheme where the robot utilises people as planners to benefit from their effective planning decisions and social behaviours. Through a set of rule-based evaluations, we identify suitable human leaders who exhibit the potential to guide the robot towards its goal. Using a simple base planner, the robot follows the selected leader through shorthorizon subgoals that are designed to be straightforward to achieve. We demonstrate through both simulated and real-world experiments that our novel framework generates safe and efficient robot plans compared to existing planners, even without predictive or data-driven modules. Our method also brings human-like robot behaviours without explicitly defining traffic rules and social norms.

However, designing effective curricula for a specific task often requires extensive domain knowledge and human intervention, which limits its applicability across various domains. Our core idea is that large language models (LLMs), with their extensive training on diverse language data and ability to encapsulate world knowledge, present significant potential for efficiently breaking down tasks and decomposing skills across various robotics environments. Additionally, the demonstrated success of LLMs in translating natural language into executable code for RL agents strengthens their role in generating task curricula. In this work, we propose CurricuLLM, which leverages the high-level planning and programming capabilities of LLMs for curriculum design, thereby enhancing the efficient learning of complex target tasks. CurricuLLM consists of: (Step 1) Generating sequence of subtasks that aid target task learning in natural language form, (Step 2) Translating natural language description of subtasks in executable task code, including the reward code and goal distribution code, and (Step 3) Evaluating trained policies based on trajectory rollout and subtask description. We evaluate CurricuLLM in various robotics simulation environments, ranging from manipulation, navigation, and locomotion, to show that CurricuLLM can aid learning complex robot control tasks. In addition, we validate humanoid locomotion policy learned through CurricuLLM in real-world.

Traditional methods rely on labor-intensive annotations or rigid assumptions, limiting flexibility. We propose a framework combining sparse keypoint tracking and probabilistic modeling that propagates expert-annotated landmarks across endoscopic frames, even with large tissue deformations. Clustered tissue keypoints enable dynamic local transformation construction via PCA, and tool poses, tracked similarly, are expressed relative to these frames. Embedding these into a Task-Parameterized Gaussian Mixture Model (TP-GMM) integrates data-driven observations with labeled clinical expertise, effectively predicting relative tool-tissue poses and enhancing visual understanding of robotic surgical motions directly from video data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA'25 Workshop of 3rd Robot-Assisted Medical Imaging</p></details> |

We propose a multimodal demonstration learning framework that explicitly models human demonstrations from RGB video with robot demonstrations in voxelized RGB-D space. Focusing on the "pick and place" task from the RH20T dataset, we utilize data from 5 users across 10 diverse scenes. Our approach combines ResNet-based visual encoding for human intention modeling and a Perceiver Transformer for voxel-based robot action prediction. After 2000 training epochs, the human model reaches 71.67% accuracy, and the robot model achieves 71.8% accuracy, demonstrating the framework's potential for aligning complex, multimodal human and robot behaviors in manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA'...</summary><p>ICRA'25 Workshop: Human-Centered Robot Learning in the Era of Big Data and Large Models</p></details> |

This paper proposes an innovative framework that integrates advanced visual perception, continuous ergonomic monitoring, and adaptive Behaviour Tree decision-making to overcome the limitations of traditional methods that typically operate as isolated components. Our approach synthesizes deep learning models, advanced tracking algorithms, and dynamic ergonomic assessments into a modular, scalable, and adaptive system. Experimental validation demonstrates the framework's superiority over existing solutions across multiple dimensions: the visual perception module outperformed previous detection models with 72.4% mAP@50:95; the system achieved high accuracy in recognizing operator intentions (92.5%); it promptly classified ergonomic risks with minimal latency (0.57 seconds); and it dynamically managed robotic interventions with exceptionally responsive decision-making capabilities (0.07 seconds), representing a 56% improvement over benchmark systems.

This paper introduces a teacher prior framework based on the teacher student paradigm, integrating imitation and auxiliary task learning to improve learning efficiency and generalization. Unlike traditional paradigms that strongly rely on encoder-based state embeddings, our framework decouples the network design, simplifying the policy network and deployment. A high performance teacher policy is first trained using privileged information to acquire generalizable motion skills. The teacher's motion distribution is transferred to the student policy, which relies only on noisy proprioceptive data, via a generative adversarial mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by distributional shifts. Additionally, auxiliary task learning enhances the student policy's feature representation, speeding up convergence and improving adaptability to varying terrains. The framework is validated on a humanoid robot, showing a great improvement in locomotion stability on dynamic terrains and significant reductions in development costs. This work provides a practical solution for deploying robust locomotion strategies in humanoid robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Drone-based additive manufacturing promises flexible and autonomous material deposition in large-scale or hazardous environments. However, achieving robust real-time control of a multi-rotor aerial robot under varying payloads and potential disturbances remains challenging. Traditional controllers like PID often require frequent parameter re-tuning, limiting their applicability in dynamic scenarios. We propose a DRL framework that learns adaptable control policies for multi-rotor drones performing waypoint navigation in AM tasks. We compare Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) within a curriculum learning scheme designed to handle increasing complexity. Our experiments show TD3 consistently balances training stability, accuracy, and success, particularly when mass variability is introduced. These findings provide a scalable path toward robust, autonomous drone control in additive manufacturing.</p></details> |  |

However, unlike human social learning, they lack a critical pathway for intrinsic cognitive development, namely, learning from human feedback during interaction. To understand human ubiquitous observation, supervision, and shared control in dynamic and uncertain environments, this study presents a brain-computer interface (BCI) framework that enables classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect cognitively demanding and safety-critical events. As a timely and motivating co-robotic engineering application, we simulate a human-in-the-loop scenario to flag risky events in semi-autonomous robotic driving-representative of long-tail cases that pose persistent bottlenecks to the safety performance of smart mobility systems and robotic vehicles. Drawing on recent advances in few-shot learning, we propose a dual-attention Siamese convolutional network paired with Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging approach to generate robust EEG-encoded signal representations. Inverse source localization reveals activation in Broadman areas 4 and 9, indicating perception-action coupling during task-relevant mental imagery. The model achieves 80% classification accuracy under data-scarce conditions and exhibits a nearly 100% increase in the utility of salient features compared to state-of-the-art methods, as measured through integrated gradient attribution. Beyond performance, this study contributes to our understanding of the cognitive architecture required for BCI agents-particularly the role of attention and memory mechanisms-in categorizing diverse mental states and supporting both inter- and intra-subject adaptation. Overall, this research advances the development of cognitive robotics and socially guided learning for service robots in complex built environments.</p></details> | 50 pages, 18 figures |

Understanding impacts on kinematics, muscle activity, and HRI dynamics is key to achieve improved usability of wearable robots. Objectives: We propose a systematic methodology evaluate an ankle exoskeleton's effects on human movement during walking and load-carrying (10 kg front pack), focusing on joint kinematics, muscle activity, and HRI torque signals. Materials and Methods: Using Xsens MVN (inertial motion capture), Delsys EMG, and a unilateral exoskeleton, three experiments were conducted: (1) isolated dorsiflexion/plantarflexion; (2) gait analysis (two subjects, passive/active modes); and (3) load-carrying under assistance. Results and Conclusions: The first experiment confirmed that the HRI sensor captured both voluntary and involuntary torques, providing directional torque insights. The second experiment showed that the device slightly restricted ankle range of motion (RoM) but supported normal gait patterns across all assistance modes. The exoskeleton reduced muscle activity, particularly in active mode. HRI torque varied according to gait phases and highlighted reduced synchronization, suggesting a need for improved support. The third experiment revealed that load-carrying increased GM and TA muscle activity, but the device partially mitigated user effort by reducing muscle activity compared to unassisted walking. HRI increased during load-carrying, providing insights into user-device dynamics. These results demonstrate the importance of tailoring exoskeleton evaluation methods to specific devices and users, while offering a framework for future studies on exoskeleton biomechanics and HRI.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving comprehensive environmental perception still requires cooperation with additional sensors, which makes the system bulky and limits its adaptability to unstructured environments. In this work, we present a vision-enhanced camera-based dual-modality sensor, which realizes full-scale distance sensing from 50 cm to -3 mm while simultaneously keeping ultra-high-resolution texture sensing and reconstruction capabilities. Unlike conventional designs with fixed opaque gel layers, our sensor features a partially transparent sliding window, enabling mechanical switching between tactile and visual modes. For each sensing mode, a dynamic distance sensing model and a contact geometry reconstruction model are proposed. Through integration with soft robotic fingers, we systematically evaluate the performance of each mode, as well as in their synergistic operation. Experimental results show robust distance tracking across various speeds, nanometer-scale roughness detection, and sub-millimeter 3D texture reconstruction. The combination of both modalities improves the robot's efficiency in executing grasping tasks. Furthermore, the embedded mechanical transmission in the sensor allows for fine-grained intra-hand adjustments and precise manipulation, unlocking new capabilities for soft robotic hands.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shoulder Range of Motion Rehabilitation Robot Incorporating Scapulohumeral Rhythm for Frozen Shoulder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10163v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel rehabilitation robot designed to address the challenges of passive range of motion (PROM) exercises for frozen shoulder patients by integrating advanced scapulohumeral rhythm stabilization. Frozen shoulder is characterized by limited glenohumeral motion and disrupted scapulohumeral rhythm, with therapist-assisted interventions being highly effective for restoring normal shoulder function. While existing robotic solutions replicate natural shoulder biomechanics, they lack the ability to stabilize compensatory movements, such as shoulder shrugging, which are critical for effective rehabilitation. Our proposed device features a 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) mechanism, including 5 DoF for shoulder motion and an innovative 1 DoF Joint press for scapular stabilization. The robot employs a personalized two-phase operation: recording normal shoulder movement patterns from the unaffected side and applying them to guide the affected side. Experimental results demonstrated the robot's ability to replicate recorded motion patterns with high precision, with root mean square error (RMSE) values consistently below 1 degree. In simulated frozen shoulder conditions, the robot effectively suppressed scapular elevation, delaying the onset of compensatory movements and guiding the affected shoulder to move more closely in alignment with normal shoulder motion, particularly during arm elevation movements such as abduction and flexion. These findings confirm the robot's potential as a rehabilitation tool capable of automating PROM exercises while correcting compensatory movements. The system provides a foundation for advanced, personalized rehabilitation for patients with frozen shoulders.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint of a manuscript that has been submitted for publication</p></details> |

Nevertheless, their real-world deployment is hindered by substantial computational and storage demands. Recent insights into the homogeneous patterns in the LLM layer have inspired sparsification techniques to address these challenges, such as early exit and token pruning. However, these methods often neglect the critical role of the final layers that encode the semantic information most relevant to downstream robotic tasks. Aligning with the recent breakthrough of the Shallow Brain Hypothesis (SBH) in neuroscience and the mixture of experts in model sparsification, we conceptualize each LLM layer as an expert and propose a Mixture-of-Layers Vision-Language-Action model (MoLe-VLA, or simply MoLe) architecture for dynamic LLM layer activation. We introduce a Spatial-Temporal Aware Router (STAR) for MoLe to selectively activate only parts of the layers based on the robot's current state, mimicking the brain's distinct signal pathways specialized for cognition and causal reasoning. Additionally, to compensate for the cognitive ability of LLMs lost in MoLe, we devise a Cognition Self-Knowledge Distillation (CogKD) framework. CogKD enhances the understanding of task demands and improves the generation of task-relevant action sequences by leveraging cognitive features. Extensive experiments conducted in both RLBench simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the superiority of MoLe-VLA in both efficiency and performance. Specifically, MoLe-VLA achieves an 8% improvement in the mean success rate across ten tasks while reducing computational costs by up to x5.6 compared to standard LLMs.</p></details> |  |

EmbodiedAgent addresses critical limitations of hallucination in impractical tasks. Our approach integrates a next-action prediction paradigm with a structured memory system to decompose tasks into executable robot skills while dynamically validating actions against environmental constraints. We present MultiPlan+, a dataset of more than 18,000 annotated planning instances spanning 100 scenarios, including a subset of impractical cases to mitigate hallucination. To evaluate performance, we propose the Robot Planning Assessment Schema (RPAS), combining automated metrics with LLM-aided expert grading. Experiments demonstrate EmbodiedAgent's superiority over state-of-the-art models, achieving 71.85% RPAS score. Real-world validation in an office service task highlights its ability to coordinate heterogeneous robots for long-horizon objectives.</p></details> |  |

A velocity-free control law is proposed by combining the internal model principle and the passivity-based output-feedback control approach. The resulting controller not only ensures asymptotic convergence of the regulation error but also rejects unwanted external sinusoidal disturbances. The potential of the proposed method lies in its simplicity, intuitiveness, and straightforward gain selection criteria for the synthesis of multi-joint robot manipulator control systems.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose GenTe, a framework for generating physically realistic and adaptable terrains to train generalizable locomotion policies. GenTe constructs an atomic terrain library that includes both geometric and physical terrains, enabling curriculum training for reinforcement learning-based locomotion policies. By leveraging function-calling techniques and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), GenTe generates complex, contextually relevant terrains from textual and graphical inputs. The framework introduces realistic force modeling for terrain interactions, capturing effects such as soil sinkage and hydrodynamic resistance. To the best of our knowledge, GenTe is the first framework that systemically generates simulation environments for legged robot locomotion control. Additionally, we introduce a benchmark of 100 generated terrains. Experiments demonstrate improved generalization and robustness in bipedal robot locomotion.</p></details> |  |

However, human oversight remains crucial. This study compared two touchless methods for directing mobile robots: voice control and gesture control, to investigate the efficiency of the methods and the preference of users. We tested these methods in two conditions: one in which participants remained stationary and one in which they walked freely alongside the robot. We hypothesized that walking alongside the robot would result in higher intuitiveness ratings and improved task performance, based on the idea that walking promotes spatial alignment and reduces the effort required for mental rotation. In a 2x2 within-subject design, 218 participants guided the quadruped robot Spot along a circuitous route with multiple 90-degree turns using rotate left, rotate right, and walk forward commands. After each trial, participants rated the intuitiveness of the command mapping, while post-experiment interviews were used to gather the participants' preferences. Results showed that voice control combined with walking with Spot was the most favored and intuitive, whereas gesture control while standing caused confusion for left/right commands. Nevertheless, 29% of participants preferred gesture control, citing increased task engagement and visual congruence as reasons. An odometry-based analysis revealed that participants often followed behind Spot, particularly in the gesture control condition, when they were allowed to walk. In conclusion, voice control with walking produced the best outcomes. Improving physical ergonomics and adjusting gesture types could make gesture control more effective.</p></details> |  |

However, their application to multi-person tracking (MPT) has been limited due to data scarcity and the inherent difficulty of distinguishing individuals. In this study, we propose a cooperative MPT system that utilizes co-located RGB and thermal cameras, where pseudo-annotations (bounding boxes and person IDs) are used to train both RGB and thermal trackers. Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the thermal tracker performs robustly in both bright and dark environments. Moreover, the results suggest that a tracker-switching strategy -- guided by a binary brightness classifier -- is more effective for information integration than a tracker-fusion approach. As an application example, we present an image change pattern recognition (ICPR) method, the ``human-as-landmark,'' which combines two key properties: the thermal recognizability of humans in dark environments and the rich landmark characteristics -- appearance, geometry, and semantics -- of static objects (occluders). Whereas conventional SLAM focuses on mapping static landmarks in well-lit environments, the present study takes a first step toward a new Human-Only SLAM paradigm, ``DD-SLAM,'' which aims to map even dynamic landmarks in complete darkness.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, technical report</p></details> |

By parameterizing the control input with an initial stabilizing feedback term, we are able to reduce the width of the predicted state intervals compared to existing methods. We demonstrate this through a numerical comparison where we show that our controller performs better in the presence of large amounts of noise. Finally, we present a simulation study of a robot navigation scenario, where we incorporate a time-varying entropy term into the cost function in order to autonomously explore an uncertain area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in L-CSS</p></details> |

Using a dataset that included facial emotion detection, eye gaze estimation, and gestures from 55 participants in a user study, we analyzed how human behavior changed in response to different types of failures and varying explanation levels. Our goal is to assess whether human collaborators are ready to accept less detailed explanations without inducing confusion. We formulate a data-driven predictor to predict human confusion during robot failure explanations. We also propose and evaluate a mechanism, based on the predictor, to adapt the explanation level according to observed human behavior. The promising results from this evaluation indicate the potential of this research in adapting a robot's explanations for failures to enhance the collaborative experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, Manuscript in submission for IROS 2025</p></details> |

However, advancing surgeon-robot collaboration still requires further research, particularly on task-specific automation. For instance, automated tool segmentation can assist surgeons in visualizing and tracking of endovascular tools during cardiac procedures. While learning-based models have demonstrated state-of-the-art segmentation performances, generating ground-truth labels for fully-supervised methods is both labor-intensive time consuming, and costly. In this study, we propose a weakly-supervised learning method with multi-lateral pseudo labeling for tool segmentation in cardiovascular angiogram datasets. The method utilizes a modified U-Net architecture featuring one encoder and multiple laterally branched decoders. The decoders generate diverse pseudo labels under different perturbations, augmenting available partial labels. The pseudo labels are self-generated using a mixed loss function with shared consistency across the decoders. The weakly-supervised model was trained end-to-end and validated using partially annotated angiogram data from three cardiovascular catheterization procedures. Validation results show that the model could perform closer to fully-supervised models. Also, the proposed weakly-supervised multi-lateral method outperforms three well known methods used for weakly-supervised learning, offering the highest segmentation performance across the three angiogram datasets. Furthermore, numerous ablation studies confirmed the model's consistent performance under different parameters. Finally, the model was applied for tool segmentation in a robot-assisted catheterization experiments. The model enhanced visualization with high connectivity indices for guidewire and catheter, and a mean processing time of 35 ms per frame.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies that compared different formats of AARs have mainly focused on human teams. However, the inclusion of robotic teammates brings along new challenges in understanding teammate intent and communication. Traditional AAR between human teammates may not be satisfactory for human-robot teams. To address this limitation, we propose a new training review (TR) tool, called the Virtual Spectator Interface (VSI), to enhance human-robot team performance and situational awareness (SA) in a simulated search mission. The proposed VSI primarily utilizes visual feedback to review subjects' behavior. To examine the effectiveness of VSI, we took elements from AAR to conduct our own TR, designed a 1 x 3 between-subjects experiment with experimental conditions: TR with (1) VSI, (2) screen recording, and (3) non-technology (only verbal descriptions). The results of our experiments demonstrated that the VSI did not result in significantly better team performance than other conditions. However, the TR with VSI led to more improvement in the subjects SA over the other conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Functors provide structured maps between planning domain ontologies which enables the transfer of task plans without the need for replanning. Unlike methods tailored to specific plans, our framework applies universally within the source domain once a structured map is defined. We demonstrate this approach by transferring a task plan from the canonical Blocksworld domain to one compatible with the AI2-THOR Kitchen environment. Additionally, we discuss practical limitations, propose benchmarks for evaluating symbolic plan transfer methods, and outline future directions for scaling this approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[REALM: Real-Time Estimates of Assistance for Learned Models in Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09243v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are a variety of mechanisms (i.e., input types) for real-time human interaction that can facilitate effective human-robot teaming. For example, previous works have shown how teleoperation, corrective, and discrete (i.e., preference over a small number of choices) input can enable robots to complete complex tasks. However, few previous works have looked at combining different methods, and in particular, opportunities for a robot to estimate and elicit the most effective form of assistance given its understanding of a task. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the value of different human assistance mechanisms based on the action uncertainty of a robot policy. Our key idea is to construct mathematical expressions for the expected post-interaction differential entropy (i.e., uncertainty) of a stochastic robot policy to compare the expected value of different interactions. As each type of human input imposes a different requirement for human involvement, we demonstrate how differential entropy estimates can be combined with a likelihood penalization approach to effectively balance feedback informational needs with the level of required input. We demonstrate evidence of how our approach interfaces with emergent learning models (e.g., a diffusion model) to produce accurate assistance value estimates through both simulation and a robot user study. Our user study results indicate that the proposed approach can enable task completion with minimal human feedback for uncertain robot behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

Utilizing soft-legged robots in performing tasks as a replacement for human beings is an important stride to take, especially under harsh and hazardous conditions over rough terrain environments. For the demand to teach any robot how to behave in different scenarios, a real-time physical and visual simulation is essential. When it comes to soft robots specifically, a simulation framework is still an arduous problem that needs to be disclosed. Using the simulation open framework architecture (SOFA) is an advantageous step. However, neither SOFA's manual nor prior public SOFA projects show its maximum capabilities the users can reach. So, we resolved this by establishing customized settings and handling the framework components appropriately. Settling on perfect, fine-tuned SOFA parameters has stimulated our motivation towards implementing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) reinforcement learning (RL) method of proximal policy optimization (PPO). The final representation is a well-defined, ready-to-deploy walking, tripedal, soft-legged robot based on PPO-RL in a SOFA environment. Robot navigation performance is a key metric to be considered for measuring the success resolution. Although in the simulated soft robots case, an 82\% success rate in reaching a single goal is a groundbreaking output, we pushed the boundaries to further steps by evaluating the progress under assigning a sequence of goals. While trailing the platform steps, outperforming discovery has been observed with an accumulative squared error deviation of 19 mm.

| **[Concurrent-Allocation Task Execution for Multi-Robot Path-Crossing-Minimal Navigation in Obstacle Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09230v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reducing undesirable path crossings among trajectories of different robots is vital in multi-robot navigation missions, which not only reduces detours and conflict scenarios, but also enhances navigation efficiency and boosts productivity. Despite recent progress in multi-robot path-crossing-minimal (MPCM) navigation, the majority of approaches depend on the minimal squared-distance reassignment of suitable desired points to robots directly. However, if obstacles occupy the passing space, calculating the actual robot-point distances becomes complex or intractable, which may render the MPCM navigation in obstacle environments inefficient or even infeasible. In this paper, the concurrent-allocation task execution (CATE) algorithm is presented to address this problem (i.e., MPCM navigation in obstacle environments). First, the path-crossing-related elements in terms of (i) robot allocation, (ii) desired-point convergence, and (iii) collision and obstacle avoidance are encoded into integer and control barrier function (CBF) constraints. Then, the proposed constraints are used in an online constrained optimization framework, which implicitly yet effectively minimizes the possible path crossings and trajectory length in obstacle environments by minimizing the desired point allocation cost and slack variables in CBF constraints simultaneously. In this way, the MPCM navigation in obstacle environments can be achieved with flexible spatial orderings. Note that the feasibility of solutions and the asymptotic convergence property of the proposed CATE algorithm in obstacle environments are both guaranteed, and the calculation burden is also reduced by concurrently calculating the optimal allocation and the control input directly without the path planning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compliant Explicit Reference Governor for Contact Friendly Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09188v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the Compliant Explicit Reference Governor (C-ERG), an extension of the Explicit Reference Governor that allows the robot to operate safely while in contact with the environment. The C-ERG is an intermediate layer that can be placed between a high-level planner and a low-level controller: its role is to enforce operational constraints and to enable the smooth transition between free-motion and contact operations. The C-ERG ensures safety by limiting the total energy available to the robotic arm at the time of contact. In the absence of contact, however, the C-ERG does not penalize the system performance. Numerical examples showcase the behavior of the C-ERG for increasingly complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steady-State Drifting Equilibrium Analysis of Single-Track Two-Wheeled Robots for Controller Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09134v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drifting is an advanced driving technique where the wheeled robot's tire-ground interaction breaks the common non-holonomic pure rolling constraint. This allows high-maneuverability tasks like quick cornering, and steady-state drifting control enhances motion stability under lateral slip conditions. While drifting has been successfully achieved in four-wheeled robot systems, its application to single-track two-wheeled (STTW) robots, such as unmanned motorcycles or bicycles, has not been thoroughly studied. To bridge this gap, this paper extends the drifting equilibrium theory to STTW robots and reveals the mechanism behind the steady-state drifting maneuver. Notably, the counter-steering drifting technique used by skilled motorcyclists is explained through this theory. In addition, an analytical algorithm based on intrinsic geometry and kinematics relationships is proposed, reducing the computation time by four orders of magnitude while maintaining less than 6% error compared to numerical methods. Based on equilibrium analysis, a model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to achieve steady-state drifting and equilibrium points transition, with its effectiveness and robustness validated through simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Robot Coordination with Adversarial Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09047v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the resilience of perception-based multi-robot coordination with wireless communication to online adversarial perception. A systematic study of this problem is essential for many safety-critical robotic applications that rely on the measurements from learned perception modules. We consider a (small) team of quadrotor robots that rely only on an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and the visual data measurements obtained from a learned multi-task perception module (e.g., object detection) for downstream tasks, including relative localization and coordination. We focus on a class of adversarial perception attacks that cause misclassification, mislocalization, and latency. We propose that the effects of adversarial misclassification and mislocalization can be modeled as sporadic (intermittent) and spurious measurement data for the downstream tasks. To address this, we present a framework for resilience analysis of multi-robot coordination with adversarial measurements. The framework integrates data from Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and the learned perception model for robust relative localization and state estimation in the presence of adversarially sporadic and spurious measurements. The framework allows for quantifying the degradation in system observability and stability in relation to the success rate of adversarial perception. Finally, experimental results on a multi-robot platform demonstrate the real-world applicability of our methodology for resource-constrained robotic platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear at the 2025 Int'l Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</p></details> |
| **[Performance Evaluation of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for a Quadruped Robot Leg](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08698v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complexities in the dynamic model of the legged robots make it necessary to utilize model-free controllers in the task of trajectory tracking. In This paper, an adaptive transpose Jacobian approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic model complexity, which utilizes an adaptive PI-algorithm to adjust the control gains. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is compared with the conventional transpose Jacobian and sliding mode control algorithms and evaluated by the root mean square of the errors and control input energy criteria. In order to appraise the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software for a quadruped robot leg for semi-elliptical path tracking. The obtained results show that the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian reduces the overshoot and root mean square of the errors and at the same time, decreases the control input energy. Moreover, transpose Jacobin and adaptive transpose Jacobian are more robust to changes in initial conditions compared to the conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, sliding mode control performs well up to 20% uncertainties in the parameters due to its model-based nature, whereas the transpose Jacobin and the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian algorithms show promising results even in higher mass uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Xplore</p></details> |

| **[Safe Flow Matching: Robot Motion Planning with Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08661v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling have led to promising results in robot motion planning, particularly through diffusion and flow-based models that capture complex, multimodal trajectory distributions. However, these methods are typically trained offline and remain limited when faced with unseen environments or dynamic constraints, often lacking explicit mechanisms to ensure safety during deployment. In this work, we propose, Safe Flow Matching (SafeFM), a motion planning approach for trajectory generation that integrates flow matching with safety guarantees. By incorporating the proposed flow matching barrier functions, SafeFM ensures that generated trajectories remain within safe regions throughout the planning horizon, even in the presence of previously unseen obstacles or state-action constraints. Unlike diffusion-based approaches, our method allows for direct, efficient sampling of constraint-satisfying trajectories, making it well-suited for real-time motion planning. We evaluate SafeFM on a diverse set of tasks, including planar robot navigation and 7-DoF manipulation, demonstrating superior safety, generalization, and planning performance compared to state-of-the-art generative planners.

| **[MBE-ARI: A Multimodal Dataset Mapping Bi-directional Engagement in Animal-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08646v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animal-robot interaction (ARI) remains an unexplored challenge in robotics, as robots struggle to interpret the complex, multimodal communication cues of animals, such as body language, movement, and vocalizations. Unlike human-robot interaction, which benefits from established datasets and frameworks, animal-robot interaction lacks the foundational resources needed to facilitate meaningful bidirectional communication. To bridge this gap, we present the MBE-ARI (Multimodal Bidirectional Engagement in Animal-Robot Interaction), a novel multimodal dataset that captures detailed interactions between a legged robot and cows. The dataset includes synchronized RGB-D streams from multiple viewpoints, annotated with body pose and activity labels across interaction phases, offering an unprecedented level of detail for ARI research. Additionally, we introduce a full-body pose estimation model tailored for quadruped animals, capable of tracking 39 keypoints with a mean average precision (mAP) of 92.7%, outperforming existing benchmarks in animal pose estimation. The MBE-ARI dataset and our pose estimation framework lay a robust foundation for advancing research in animal-robot interaction, providing essential tools for developing perception, reasoning, and interaction frameworks needed for effective collaboration between robots and animals. The dataset and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/RISELabPurdue/MBE-ARI/, inviting further exploration and development in this critical area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[FindAnything: Open-Vocabulary and Object-Centric Mapping for Robot Exploration in Any Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08603v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometrically accurate and semantically expressive map representations have proven invaluable to facilitate robust and safe mobile robot navigation and task planning. Nevertheless, real-time, open-vocabulary semantic understanding of large-scale unknown environments is still an open problem. In this paper we present FindAnything, an open-world mapping and exploration framework that incorporates vision-language information into dense volumetric submaps. Thanks to the use of vision-language features, FindAnything bridges the gap between pure geometric and open-vocabulary semantic information for a higher level of understanding while allowing to explore any environment without the help of any external source of ground-truth pose information. We represent the environment as a series of volumetric occupancy submaps, resulting in a robust and accurate map representation that deforms upon pose updates when the underlying SLAM system corrects its drift, allowing for a locally consistent representation between submaps. Pixel-wise vision-language features are aggregated from efficient SAM (eSAM)-generated segments, which are in turn integrated into object-centric volumetric submaps, providing a mapping from open-vocabulary queries to 3D geometry that is scalable also in terms of memory usage. The open-vocabulary map representation of FindAnything achieves state-of-the-art semantic accuracy in closed-set evaluations on the Replica dataset. This level of scene understanding allows a robot to explore environments based on objects or areas of interest selected via natural language queries. Our system is the first of its kind to be deployed on resource-constrained devices, such as MAVs, leveraging vision-language information for real-world robotic tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Diffusion Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08438v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in visual domains such as image and video generation. They have also recently emerged as a promising approach in robotics, especially in robot manipulations. Diffusion models leverage a probabilistic framework, and they stand out with their ability to model multi-modal distributions and their robustness to high-dimensional input and output spaces. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art diffusion models in robotic manipulation, including grasp learning, trajectory planning, and data augmentation. Diffusion models for scene and image augmentation lie at the intersection of robotics and computer vision for vision-based tasks to enhance generalizability and data scarcity. This paper also presents the two main frameworks of diffusion models and their integration with imitation learning and reinforcement learning. In addition, it discusses the common architectures and benchmarks and points out the challenges and advantages of current state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Human strategies for correcting `human-robot' errors during a laundry sorting task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08395v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mental models and expectations underlying human-human interaction (HHI) inform human-robot interaction (HRI) with domestic robots. To ease collaborative home tasks by improving domestic robot speech and behaviours for human-robot communication, we designed a study to understand how people communicated when failure occurs. To identify patterns of natural communication, particularly in response to robotic failures, participants instructed Laundrobot to move laundry into baskets using natural language and gestures. Laundrobot either worked error-free, or in one of two error modes. Participants were not advised Laundrobot would be a human actor, nor given information about error modes. Video analysis from 42 participants found speech patterns, included laughter, verbal expressions, and filler words, such as ``oh'' and ``ok'', also, sequences of body movements, including touching one's own face, increased pointing with a static finger, and expressions of surprise. Common strategies deployed when errors occurred, included correcting and teaching, taking responsibility, and displays of frustration. The strength of reaction to errors diminished with exposure, possibly indicating acceptance or resignation. Some used strategies similar to those used to communicate with other technologies, such as smart assistants. An anthropomorphic robot may not be ideally suited to this kind of task. Laundrobot's appearance, morphology, voice, capabilities, and recovery strategies may have impacted how it was perceived. Some participants indicated Laundrobot's actual skills were not aligned with expectations; this made it difficult to know what to expect and how much Laundrobot understood. Expertise, personality, and cultural differences may affect responses, however these were not assessed.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a novel RL framework leveraging foot-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs). Instead of pursuing detailed actuator modeling and system identification, we utilize foot-mounted IMU measurements to enhance rapid stabilization capabilities over challenging terrains. Additionally, we propose symmetric data augmentation dedicated to the proposed observation space and random network distillation to enhance bipedal locomotion learning over rough terrain. We validate our approach through hardware experiments on a miniature-sized humanoid EVAL-03 over a variety of environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method improves rapid stabilization capabilities over non-rigid surfaces and sudden environmental transitions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sony.github.io/learning-feet-imu-locomotion/</p></details> |
| **[Task Matters: Investigating Human Questioning Behavior in Different Household Service for Learning by Asking Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13916v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning by Asking (LBA) enables robots to identify knowledge gaps during task execution and acquire the missing information by asking targeted questions. However, different tasks often require different types of questions, and how to adapt questioning strategies accordingly remains underexplored. This paper investigates human questioning behavior in two representative household service tasks: a Goal-Oriented task (refrigerator organization) and a Process-Oriented task (cocktail mixing). Through a human-human study involving 28 participants, we analyze the questions asked using a structured framework that encodes each question along three dimensions: acquired knowledge, cognitive process, and question form. Our results reveal that participants adapt both question types and their temporal ordering based on task structure. Goal-Oriented tasks elicited early inquiries about user preferences, while Process-Oriented tasks led to ongoing, parallel questioning of procedural steps and preferences. These findings offer actionable insights for developing task-sensitive questioning strategies in LBA-enabled robots for more effective and personalized human-robot collaboration.</p></details> |  |

While traditional practices involve hiring human caregivers to serve meals and attend to basic needs, older adults often require continuous companionship and health monitoring. However, hiring human caregivers for this job costs a lot of money. However, using a robot like Nao could be cheaper and still helpful. This study explores the integration of humanoid robots, particularly Nao, in health monitoring and caregiving for older adults. Using a mixed-methods approach with a within-subject factorial design, we investigated the effectiveness of nonverbal communication modalities, including touch, gestures, and LED patterns, in enhancing human-robot interactions. Our results indicate that Nao's touch-based health monitoring was well-received by participants, with positive ratings across various dimensions. LED patterns were perceived as more effective and accurate compared to hand and head gestures. Moreover, longer interactions were associated with higher trust levels and perceived empathy, highlighting the importance of prolonged engagement in fostering trust in human-robot interactions. Despite limitations, our study contributes valuable insights into the potential of humanoid robots to improve health monitoring and caregiving for older adults.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The dataset used in this manuscript was created for the purpose of a class project and does not represent actual research data reviewed through a formal ethical process.
