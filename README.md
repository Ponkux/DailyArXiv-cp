| **[Multi-Modal Multi-Task (M3T) Federated Foundation Models for Embodied AI: Potentials and Challenges for Edge Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11191v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As embodied AI systems become increasingly multi-modal, personalized, and interactive, they must learn effectively from diverse sensory inputs, adapt continually to user preferences, and operate safely under resource and privacy constraints. These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: Foundation Models (FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas Federated Learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied environments. In this vision paper, we introduce Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed nature of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical deployment dimensions of FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning, Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for deploying FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Embodied AI in Machine Learning -- is it Really Embodied?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10705v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is gaining momentum in the machine learning communities with the goal of leveraging current progress in AI (deep learning, transformers, large language and visual-language models) to empower robots. In this chapter we put this work in the context of "Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence" (GOFAI) (Haugeland, 1989) and the behavior-based or embodied alternatives (R. A. Brooks 1991; Pfeifer and Scheier 2001). We claim that the AI-powered robots are only weakly embodied and inherit some of the problems of GOFAI. Moreover, we review and critically discuss the possibility of cross-embodiment learning (Padalkar et al. 2024). We identify fundamental roadblocks and propose directions on how to make progress.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |
| **[KAITIAN: A Unified Communication Framework for Enabling Efficient Collaboration Across Heterogeneous Accelerators in Embodied AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10183v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, such as autonomous robots and intelligent vehicles, are increasingly reliant on diverse heterogeneous accelerators (e.g., GPGPUs, NPUs, FPGAs) to meet stringent real-time processing and energy-efficiency demands. However, the proliferation of vendor-specific proprietary communication libraries creates significant interoperability barriers, hindering seamless collaboration between different accelerator types and leading to suboptimal resource utilization and performance bottlenecks in distributed AI workloads. This paper introduces KAITIAN, a novel distributed communication framework designed to bridge this gap. KAITIAN provides a unified abstraction layer that intelligently integrates vendor-optimized communication libraries for intra-group efficiency with general-purpose communication protocols for inter-group interoperability. Crucially, it incorporates a load-adaptive scheduling mechanism that dynamically balances computational tasks across heterogeneous devices based on their real-time performance characteristics. Implemented as an extension to PyTorch and rigorously evaluated on a testbed featuring NVIDIA GPUs and Cambricon MLUs, KAITIAN demonstrates significant improvements in resource utilization and scalability for distributed training tasks. Experimental results show that KAITIAN can accelerate training time by up to 42% compared to baseline homogeneous systems, while incurring minimal communication overhead (2.8--4.3%) and maintaining model accuracy. KAITIAN paves the way for more flexible and powerful heterogeneous computing in complex embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

| **[EmbodiedMAE: A Unified 3D Multi-Modal Representation for Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10105v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present EmbodiedMAE, a unified 3D multi-modal representation for robot manipulation. Current approaches suffer from significant domain gaps between training datasets and robot manipulation tasks, while also lacking model architectures that can effectively incorporate 3D information. To overcome these limitations, we enhance the DROID dataset with high-quality depth maps and point clouds, constructing DROID-3D as a valuable supplement for 3D embodied vision research. Then we develop EmbodiedMAE, a multi-modal masked autoencoder that simultaneously learns representations across RGB, depth, and point cloud modalities through stochastic masking and cross-modal fusion. Trained on DROID-3D, EmbodiedMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art vision foundation models (VFMs) in both training efficiency and final performance across 70 simulation tasks and 20 real-world robot manipulation tasks on two robot platforms. The model exhibits strong scaling behavior with size and promotes effective policy learning from 3D inputs. Experimental results establish EmbodiedMAE as a reliable unified 3D multi-modal VFM for embodied AI systems, particularly in precise tabletop manipulation settings where spatial perception is critical.</p></details> |  |
| **[EWMBench: Evaluating Scene, Motion, and Semantic Quality in Embodied World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09694v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in creative AI have enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images and videos conditioned on language instructions. Building on these developments, text-to-video diffusion models have evolved into embodied world models (EWMs) capable of generating physically plausible scenes from language commands, effectively bridging vision and action in embodied AI applications. This work addresses the critical challenge of evaluating EWMs beyond general perceptual metrics to ensure the generation of physically grounded and action-consistent behaviors. We propose the Embodied World Model Benchmark (EWMBench), a dedicated framework designed to evaluate EWMs based on three key aspects: visual scene consistency, motion correctness, and semantic alignment. Our approach leverages a meticulously curated dataset encompassing diverse scenes and motion patterns, alongside a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation toolkit, to assess and compare candidate models. The proposed benchmark not only identifies the limitations of existing video generation models in meeting the unique requirements of embodied tasks but also provides valuable insights to guide future advancements in the field. The dataset and evaluation tools are publicly available at https://github.com/AgibotTech/EWMBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://github.com/AgibotTech/EWMBench</p></details> |
| **[ON as ALC: Active Loop Closing Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11523v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In simultaneous localization and mapping, active loop closing (ALC) is an active vision problem that aims to visually guide a robot to maximize the chances of revisiting previously visited points, thereby resetting the drift errors accumulated in the incrementally built map during travel. However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Neural Brain: A Neuroscience-inspired Framework for Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07634v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted from static, data-driven models to dynamic systems capable of perceiving and interacting with real-world environments. Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 17 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Generative AI for Autonomous Driving: Frontiers and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08854v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) constitutes a transformative technological wave that reconfigures industries through its unparalleled capabilities for content creation, reasoning, planning, and multimodal understanding. This revolutionary force offers the most promising path yet toward solving one of engineering's grandest challenges: achieving reliable, fully autonomous driving, particularly the pursuit of Level 5 autonomy. This survey delivers a comprehensive and critical synthesis of the emerging role of GenAI across the autonomous driving stack. We begin by distilling the principles and trade-offs of modern generative modeling, encompassing VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models (LLMs). We then map their frontier applications in image, LiDAR, trajectory, occupancy, video generation as well as LLM-guided reasoning and decision making. We categorize practical applications, such as synthetic data workflows, end-to-end driving strategies, high-fidelity digital twin systems, smart transportation networks, and cross-domain transfer to embodied AI. We identify key obstacles and possibilities such as comprehensive generalization across rare cases, evaluation and safety checks, budget-limited implementation, regulatory compliance, ethical concerns, and environmental effects, while proposing research plans across theoretical assurances, trust metrics, transport integration, and socio-technical influence. By unifying these threads, the survey provides a forward-looking reference for researchers, engineers, and policymakers navigating the convergence of generative AI and advanced autonomous mobility.

This contribution introduces RAI - a framework for creating embodied Multi Agent Systems for robotics. The proposed framework implements tools for Agents' integration with robotic stacks, Large Language Models, and simulations. It provides out-of-the-box integration with state-of-the-art systems like ROS 2. It also comes with dedicated mechanisms for the embodiment of Agents. These mechanisms have been tested on a physical robot, Husarion ROSBot XL, which was coupled with its digital twin, for rapid prototyping. Furthermore, these mechanisms have been deployed in two simulations: (1) robot arm manipulator and (2) tractor controller. All of these deployments have been evaluated in terms of their control capabilities, effectiveness of embodiment, and perception ability. The proposed framework has been used successfully to build systems with multiple agents. It has demonstrated effectiveness in all the aforementioned tasks. It also enabled identifying and addressing the shortcomings of the generative models used for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to 23rd International Conference on Practical applications of Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (PAAMS'25)</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Collaborative Mechanisms Between Large and Small Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07460v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful AI capabilities but face deployment challenges due to high resource costs and latency, whereas Small Language Models (SLMs) offer efficiency and deployability at the cost of reduced performance. Collaboration between LLMs and SLMs emerges as a crucial paradigm to synergistically balance these trade-offs, enabling advanced AI applications, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-SLM collaboration, detailing various interaction mechanisms (pipeline, routing, auxiliary, distillation, fusion), key enabling technologies, and diverse application scenarios driven by on-device needs like low latency, privacy, personalization, and offline operation. While highlighting the significant potential for creating more efficient, adaptable, and accessible AI, we also discuss persistent challenges including system overhead, inter-model consistency, robust task allocation, evaluation complexity, and security/privacy concerns. Future directions point towards more intelligent adaptive frameworks, deeper model fusion, and expansion into multimodal and embodied AI, positioning LLM-SLM collaboration as a key driver for the next generation of practical and ubiquitous artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPT-Bench: A Large-Scale, Long-Term and Robot-Egocentric Dataset for Benchmarking Target Person Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07446v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking a target person from robot-egocentric views is crucial for developing autonomous robots that provide continuous personalized assistance or collaboration in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Embodied AI. However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoptic, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 35 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |
| **[GeoNav: Empowering MLLMs with Explicit Geospatial Reasoning Abilities for Language-Goal Aerial Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09587v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-goal aerial navigation is a critical challenge in embodied AI, requiring UAVs to localize targets in complex environments such as urban blocks based on textual specification. Existing methods, often adapted from indoor navigation, struggle to scale due to limited field of view, semantic ambiguity among objects, and lack of structured spatial reasoning. In this work, we propose GeoNav, a geospatially aware multimodal agent to enable long-range navigation. GeoNav operates in three phases-landmark navigation, target search, and precise localization-mimicking human coarse-to-fine spatial strategies. To support such reasoning, it dynamically builds two different types of spatial memory. The first is a global but schematic cognitive map, which fuses prior textual geographic knowledge and embodied visual cues into a top-down, annotated form for fast navigation to the landmark region. The second is a local but delicate scene graph representing hierarchical spatial relationships between blocks, landmarks, and objects, which is used for definite target localization. On top of this structured representation, GeoNav employs a spatially aware, multimodal chain-of-thought prompting mechanism to enable multimodal large language models with efficient and interpretable decision-making across stages. On the CityNav urban navigation benchmark, GeoNav surpasses the current state-of-the-art by up to 12.53% in success rate and significantly improves navigation efficiency, even in hard-level tasks. Ablation studies highlight the importance of each module, showcasing how geospatial representations and coarse-to-fine reasoning enhance UAV navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Agentic AI Networking in 6G: A Generative Foundation Model-as-Agent Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15764v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The promising potential of AI and network convergence in improving networking performance and enabling new service capabilities has recently attracted significant interest. Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |
| **[ACORN: Adaptive Contrastive Optimization for Safe and Robust Fine-Grained Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06628v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI research has traditionally emphasized performance metrics such as success rate and cumulative reward, overlooking critical robustness and safety considerations that emerge during real-world deployment. In actual environments, agents continuously encounter unpredicted situations and distribution shifts, causing seemingly reliable policies to experience catastrophic failures, particularly in manipulation tasks. To address this gap, we introduce four novel safety-centric metrics that quantify an agent's resilience to environmental perturbations. Building on these metrics, we present Adaptive Contrastive Optimization for Robust Manipulation (ACORN), a plug-and-play algorithm that enhances policy robustness without sacrificing performance. ACORN leverages contrastive learning to simultaneously align trajectories with expert demonstrations while diverging from potentially unsafe behaviors. Our approach efficiently generates informative negative samples through structured Gaussian noise injection, employing a double perturbation technique that maintains sample diversity while minimizing computational overhead. Comprehensive experiments across diverse manipulation environments validate ACORN's effectiveness, yielding improvements of up to 23% in safety metrics under disturbance compared to baseline methods. These findings underscore ACORN's significant potential for enabling reliable deployment of embodied agents in safety-critical real-world applications.</p></details> | 6 pages,4 figures |
| **[GRACE: Estimating Geometry-level 3D Human-Scene Contact from 2D Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06575v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the geometry level of human-scene contact aims to ground specific contact surface points at 3D human geometries, which provides a spatial prior and bridges the interaction between human and scene, supporting applications such as human behavior analysis, embodied AI, and AR/VR. To complete the task, existing approaches predominantly rely on parametric human models (e.g., SMPL), which establish correspondences between images and contact regions through fixed SMPL vertex sequences. This actually completes the mapping from image features to an ordered sequence. However, this approach lacks consideration of geometry, limiting its generalizability in distinct human geometries. In this paper, we introduce GRACE (Geometry-level Reasoning for 3D Human-scene Contact Estimation), a new paradigm for 3D human contact estimation. GRACE incorporates a point cloud encoder-decoder architecture along with a hierarchical feature extraction and fusion module, enabling the effective integration of 3D human geometric structures with 2D interaction semantics derived from images. Guided by visual cues, GRACE establishes an implicit mapping from geometric features to the vertex space of the 3D human mesh, thereby achieving accurate modeling of contact regions. This design ensures high prediction accuracy and endows the framework with strong generalization capability across diverse human geometries. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that GRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance in contact estimation, with additional results further validating its robust generalization to unstructured human point clouds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-LSTM based Multi-Agent DRL with Computation-aware Pruning for Agent Twins Migration in Vehicular Embodied AI Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06378v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of large language models and embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the intelligent transportation scenarios, the combination of them in intelligent transportation spawns the Vehicular Embodied AI Network (VEANs). In VEANs, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are typical agents whose local advanced AI applications are defined as vehicular embodied AI agents, enabling capabilities such as environment perception and multi-agent collaboration. Due to computation latency and resource constraints, the local AI applications and services running on vehicular embodied AI agents need to be migrated, and subsequently referred to as vehicular embodied AI agent twins, which drive the advancement of vehicular embodied AI networks to offload intensive tasks to Roadside Units (RSUs), mitigating latency problems while maintaining service quality. Recognizing workload imbalance among RSUs in traditional approaches, we model AV-RSU interactions as a Stackelberg game to optimize bandwidth resource allocation for efficient migration. A Tiny Multi-Agent Bidirectional LSTM Proximal Policy Optimization (TMABLPPO) algorithm is designed to approximate the Stackelberg equilibrium through decentralized coordination. Furthermore, a personalized neural network pruning algorithm based on Path eXclusion (PX) dynamically adapts to heterogeneous AV computation capabilities by identifying task-critical parameters in trained models, reducing model complexity with less performance degradation. Experimental validation confirms the algorithm's effectiveness in balancing system load and minimizing delays, demonstrating significant improvements in vehicular embodied AI agent deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[CityNavAgent: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation with Hierarchical Semantic Planning and Global Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05622v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial vision-and-language navigation (VLN), requiring drones to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex urban environments, emerges as a critical embodied AI challenge that bridges human-robot interaction, 3D spatial reasoning, and real-world deployment. Although existing ground VLN agents achieved notable results in indoor and outdoor settings, they struggle in aerial VLN due to the absence of predefined navigation graphs and the exponentially expanding action space in long-horizon exploration. In this work, we propose \textbf{CityNavAgent}, a large language model (LLM)-empowered agent that significantly reduces the navigation complexity for urban aerial VLN. Specifically, we design a hierarchical semantic planning module (HSPM) that decomposes the long-horizon task into sub-goals with different semantic levels. The agent reaches the target progressively by achieving sub-goals with different capacities of the LLM. Additionally, a global memory module storing historical trajectories into a topological graph is developed to simplify navigation for visited targets. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvement. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of different modules of CityNavAgent for aerial VLN in continuous city environments.

| **[3D Scene Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05474v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene generation seeks to synthesize spatially structured, semantically meaningful, and photorealistic environments for applications such as immersive media, robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied AI. Early methods based on procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations, trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets, evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations, and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity, physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D vision, and embodied intelligence.

| **[SITE: towards Spatial Intelligence Thorough Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05456v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence (SI) represents a cognitive ability encompassing the visualization, manipulation, and reasoning about spatial relationships, underpinning disciplines from neuroscience to robotics. We introduce SITE, a benchmark dataset towards SI Thorough Evaluation in a standardized format of multi-choice visual question-answering, designed to assess large vision-language models' spatial intelligence across diverse visual modalities (single-image, multi-image, and video) and SI factors (figural to environmental scales, spatial visualization and orientation, intrinsic and extrinsic, static and dynamic). Our approach to curating the benchmark combines a bottom-up survey about 31 existing datasets and a top-down strategy drawing upon three classification systems in cognitive science, which prompt us to design two novel types of tasks about view-taking and dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments reveal that leading models fall behind human experts especially in spatial orientation, a fundamental SI factor. Moreover, we demonstrate a positive correlation between a model's spatial reasoning proficiency and its performance on an embodied AI task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Embodied AI: Advances and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05108v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[RobotxR1: Enabling Embodied Robotic Intelligence on Large Language Models through Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03238v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future robotic systems operating in real-world environments will require on-board embodied intelligence without continuous cloud connection, balancing capabilities with constraints on computational power and memory. This work presents an extension of the R1-zero approach, which enables the usage of low parameter-count Large Language Models (LLMs) in the robotic domain. The R1-Zero approach was originally developed to enable mathematical reasoning in LLMs using static datasets. We extend it to the robotics domain through integration in a closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. This extension enhances reasoning in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) settings without relying solely on distillation of large models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We show that small-scale LLMs can achieve effective reasoning performance by learning through closed-loop interaction with their environment, which enables tasks that previously required significantly larger models. In an autonomous driving setting, a performance gain of 20.2%-points over the SFT-based baseline is observed with a Qwen2.5-1.5B model. Using the proposed training procedure, Qwen2.5-3B achieves a 63.3% control adaptability score, surpassing the 58.5% obtained by the much larger, cloud-bound GPT-4o. These results highlight that practical, on-board deployment of small LLMs is not only feasible but can outperform larger models if trained through environmental feedback, underscoring the importance of an interactive learning framework for robotic Embodied AI, one grounded in practical experience rather than static supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scenethesis: A Language and Vision Agentic Framework for 3D Scene Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02836v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing interactive 3D scenes from text is essential for gaming, virtual reality, and embodied AI. However, existing methods face several challenges. Learning-based approaches depend on small-scale indoor datasets, limiting the scene diversity and layout complexity. While large language models (LLMs) can leverage diverse text-domain knowledge, they struggle with spatial realism, often producing unnatural object placements that fail to respect common sense. Our key insight is that vision perception can bridge this gap by providing realistic spatial guidance that LLMs lack. To this end, we introduce Scenethesis, a training-free agentic framework that integrates LLM-based scene planning with vision-guided layout refinement. Given a text prompt, Scenethesis first employs an LLM to draft a coarse layout. A vision module then refines it by generating an image guidance and extracting scene structure to capture inter-object relations. Next, an optimization module iteratively enforces accurate pose alignment and physical plausibility, preventing artifacts like object penetration and instability.

| **[MetaScenes: Towards Automated Replica Creation for Real-world 3D Scans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02388v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI (EAI) research requires high-quality, diverse 3D scenes to effectively support skill acquisition, sim-to-real transfer, and generalization. Achieving these quality standards, however, necessitates the precise replication of real-world object diversity. Existing datasets demonstrate that this process heavily relies on artist-driven designs, which demand substantial human effort and present significant scalability challenges. To scalably produce realistic and interactive 3D scenes, we first present MetaScenes, a large-scale, simulatable 3D scene dataset constructed from real-world scans, which includes 15366 objects spanning 831 fine-grained categories. Then, we introduce Scan2Sim, a robust multi-modal alignment model, which enables the automated, high-quality replacement of assets, thereby eliminating the reliance on artist-driven designs for scaling 3D scenes. We further propose two benchmarks to evaluate MetaScenes: a detailed scene synthesis task focused on small item layouts for robotic manipulation and a domain transfer task in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) to validate cross-domain transfer. Results confirm MetaScene's potential to enhance EAI by supporting more generalizable agent learning and sim-to-real applications, introducing new possibilities for EAI research.

A new field called Embodied Artificial Intelligence, which places at the intersection of Computer Vision, Robotics, and Decision Making, has been gaining importance during the last few years, as it aims to foster the development of smart autonomous robots and their deployment in society. The recent availability of large collections of 3D models for photorealistic robotic simulation has allowed faster and safe training of learning-based agents for millions of frames and a careful evaluation of their behavior before deploying the models on real robotic platforms. These intelligent agents are intended to perform a certain task in a possibly unknown environment. To this end, during the training in simulation, the agents learn to perform continuous interactions with the surroundings, such as gathering information from the environment, encoding and extracting useful cues for the task, and performing actions towards the final goal; where every action of the agent influences the interactions. This dissertation follows the complete creation process of embodied agents for indoor environments, from their concept to their implementation and deployment. We aim to contribute to research in Embodied AI and autonomous agents, in order to foster future work in this field. We present a detailed analysis of the procedure behind implementing an intelligent embodied agent, comprehending a thorough description of the current state-of-the-art in literature, technical explanations of the proposed methods, and accurate experimental studies on relevant robotic tasks.</p></details> | Ph.D. Dissertation |
| **[Towards Efficient Online Tuning of VLM Agents via Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03792v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online fine-tuning vision-language model (VLM) agents with reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for equipping agents with multi-step, goal-oriented capabilities in dynamic environments. However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains.

Exploring Backdoor Attacks against Embodied LLM-based Decision-Making Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20774v3)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in real-world decision-making tasks for embodied artificial intelligence, especially when fine-tuned to leverage their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities while being tailored to specific applications. However, this fine-tuning process introduces considerable safety and security vulnerabilities, especially in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-based Decision-making systems (BALD) in embodied AI, systematically exploring the attack surfaces and trigger mechanisms. Specifically, we propose three distinct attack mechanisms: word injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection, targeting various components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline. We perform extensive experiments on representative LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2) in autonomous driving and home robot tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and stealthiness of our backdoor triggers across various attack channels, with cases like vehicles accelerating toward obstacles and robots placing knives on beds. Our word and knowledge injection attacks achieve nearly 100% success rate across multiple models and datasets while requiring only limited access to the system. Our scenario manipulation attack yields success rates exceeding 65%, reaching up to 90%, and does not require any runtime system intrusion. We also assess the robustness of these attacks against defenses, revealing their resilience. Our findings highlight critical security vulnerabilities in embodied LLM systems and emphasize the urgent need for safeguarding these systems to mitigate potential risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at ICLR 2025, 31 pages, including main paper, references, and appendix</p></details> |

In this paper, we define IGV as a technology that combines generative capabilities to produce diverse high-quality video content with interactive features that enable user engagement through control signals and responsive feedback. We survey the current landscape of IGV applications, focusing on three major domains: 1) gaming, where IGV enables infinite exploration in virtual worlds; 2) embodied AI, where IGV serves as a physics-aware environment synthesizer for training agents in multimodal interaction with dynamically evolving scenes; and 3) autonomous driving, where IGV provides closed-loop simulation capabilities for safety-critical testing and validation. To guide future development, we propose a comprehensive framework that decomposes an ideal IGV system into five essential modules: Generation, Control, Memory, Dynamics, and Intelligence. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the technical challenges and future directions in realizing each component for an ideal IGV system, such as achieving real-time generation, enabling open-domain control, maintaining long-term coherence, simulating accurate physics, and integrating causal reasoning. We believe that this systematic analysis will facilitate future research and development in the field of IGV, ultimately advancing the technology toward more sophisticated and practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the computational demands of virtual services and the inherent mobility of autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitate real-time migration of Vehicular Embodied Agent AI Twins (VEAATs) between resource-constrained Roadside Units (RSUs). This paper proposes a novel framework for efficient VEAAT migration in VEANETs, combining a multi-leader multi-follower (MLMF) Stackelberg game-theoretic incentive mechanism with a tiny multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm. First, We propose an virtual immersive experience-driven utility model that captures AV-RSU dynamic interactions by integrating AVs' social influence, service complementarity and substitutability, and RSUs' resource allocation strategies to optimize VEAAT migration decisions. Second, to enhance training efficiency and enable efficient deployment on computation-constrained AVs while preserving exploration-exploitation performance, we propose TinyMA-IEI-PPO, a self-adaptive dynamic structured pruning algorithm that dynamically adjusts neuron importance based on agents' exploration incentives. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach achieves convergence comparable to baseline models and closely approximates the Stackelberg equilibrium.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) demands fundamentally new architectures rather than merely scaling up existing models. Current approaches largely depend on expanding model parameters, which improves task-specific performance but falls short in enabling continuous, adaptable, and generalized learning. Achieving AGI capable of continuous learning and personalization on resource-constrained edge devices is an even bigger challenge. This paper reviews the state of continual learning and neuroscience-inspired AI, and proposes a novel architecture for Personalized AGI that integrates brain-like learning mechanisms for edge deployment. We review literature on continuous lifelong learning, catastrophic forgetting, and edge AI, and discuss key neuroscience principles of human learning, including Synaptic Pruning, Hebbian plasticity, Sparse Coding, and Dual Memory Systems, as inspirations for AI systems. Building on these insights, we outline an AI architecture that features complementary fast-and-slow learning modules, synaptic self-optimization, and memory-efficient model updates to support on-device lifelong adaptation. Conceptual diagrams of the proposed architecture and learning processes are provided. We address challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, memory efficiency, and system scalability, and present application scenarios for mobile AI assistants and embodied AI systems like humanoid robots. We conclude with key takeaways and future research directions toward truly continual, personalized AGI on the edge. While the architecture is theoretical, it synthesizes diverse findings and offers a roadmap for future implementation.</p></details> | 39 pages, 16 figures |

However, deploying these systems remains challenging due to prolonged runtime latency, limited scalability, and heightened sensitivity, leading to significant system inefficiencies. In this paper, we aim to understand the workload characteristics of embodied agent systems and explore optimization solutions. We systematically categorize these systems into four paradigms and conduct benchmarking studies to evaluate their task performance and system efficiency across various modules, agent scales, and embodied tasks. Our benchmarking studies uncover critical challenges, such as prolonged planning and communication latency, redundant agent interactions, complex low-level control mechanisms, memory inconsistencies, exploding prompt lengths, sensitivity to self-correction and execution, sharp declines in success rates, and reduced collaboration efficiency as agent numbers increase. Leveraging these profiling insights, we suggest system optimization strategies to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of embodied agents across different paradigms. This paper presents the first system-level analysis of embodied AI agents, and explores opportunities for advancing future embodied system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS)</p></details> |

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

Although recent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their capabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and deformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the lack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under diverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for generating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac features a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional tactile sensors \sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip detection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips. Furthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis pipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based on this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm robotic system. Experiments demonstrate that PP-Tac can effectively grasp paper-like objects of varying material, thickness, and stiffness, achieving an overall success rate of 87.5\%. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to grasp paper-like deformable objects using a tactile dexterous hand.

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods, which predominantly depend on sparse 3D point clouds, exhibit limited generalizability and robustness due to their sensitivity to coordinate variations and the inherent sparsity of the data. By contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers high-fidelity, real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead by representing scenes as dense, continuous distributions. This positions 3DGS as a highly effective approach for capturing fine-grained affordance details and improving recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, its full potential remains largely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance datasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning. This dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances, and 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object categories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce AffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning using 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal structure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align 3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat dataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain, while AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen and unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first large-scale 3D Gaussians Affordance Reasoning Benchmark</p></details> |

In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control.

Traditional defense strategies, such as input filtering and output monitoring, often introduce high computational overhead or interfere with task performance in real-time embodied scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE), a novel defense framework that leverages representation engineering to enhance the safety of embodied LLMs by dynamically steering their internal activations. CEE operates by (1) extracting multilingual safety patterns from model activations, (2) constructing control directions based on safety-aligned concept subspaces, and (3) applying subspace concept rotation to reinforce safe behavior during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that CEE effectively mitigates jailbreak attacks while maintaining task performance, outperforming existing defense methods in both robustness and efficiency. This work contributes a scalable and interpretable safety mechanism for embodied AI, bridging the gap between theoretical representation engineering and practical security applications. Our findings highlight the potential of latent-space interventions as a viable defense paradigm against emerging adversarial threats in physically grounded AI systems.</p></details> |  |

These models efficiently generate action policies by learning to predict noise. However, conventional Diffusion Policy methods rely on iterative denoising, leading to inefficient inference and slow response times, which hinder real-time robot control. To address these limitations, we propose a Classifier-Free Shortcut Diffusion Policy (CF-SDP) that integrates classifier-free guidance with shortcut-based acceleration, enabling efficient task-specific action generation while significantly improving inference speed. Furthermore, we extend diffusion modeling to the SO(3) manifold in shortcut model, defining the forward and reverse processes in its tangent space with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. This ensures stable and accurate rotational estimation, enhancing the effectiveness of diffusion-based control. Our approach achieves nearly 5x acceleration in diffusion inference compared to DDIM-based Diffusion Policy while maintaining task performance. Evaluations both on the RoboTwin simulation platform and real-world scenarios across various tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 Workshop on 2nd MEIS</p></details> |

However, multi-granularity interaction remains a challenging task due to the ambiguity of language and degraded quality when it comes to queries upon object components. In this work, we present FMLGS, an approach that supports part-level open-vocabulary query within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We propose an efficient pipeline for building and querying consistent object- and part-level semantics based on Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). We designed a semantic deviation strategy to solve the problem of language ambiguity among object parts, which interpolates the semantic features of fine-grained targets for enriched information. Once trained, we can query both objects and their describable parts using natural language. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods prove that our method can not only better locate specified part-level targets, but also achieve first-place performance concerning both speed and accuracy, where FMLGS is 98 x faster than LERF, 4 x faster than LangSplat and 2.5 x faster than LEGaussians. Meanwhile, we further integrate FMLGS as a virtual agent that can interactively navigate through 3D scenes, locate targets, and respond to user demands through a chat interface, which demonstrates the potential of our work to be further expanded and applied in the future.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development.

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods.

Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

However, synthesizing realistic and appropriate hand trajectories given a single object or hand-object interaction image is a highly ambiguous task, requiring to correctly identify the object of interest and possibly even the correct interaction among many possible alternatives. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose the SIGHT-Fusion system, consisting of a curated pipeline for extracting visual features of hand-object interaction details from egocentric videos involving object manipulation, and a diffusion-based conditional motion generation model processing the extracted features. We train our method given video data with corresponding hand trajectory annotations, without supervision in the form of action labels. For the evaluation, we establish benchmarks utilizing the first-person FPHAB and HOI4D datasets, testing our method against various baselines and using multiple metrics. We also introduce task simulators for executing the generated hand trajectories and reporting task success rates as an additional metric. Experiments show that our method generates more appropriate and realistic hand trajectories than baselines and presents promising generalization capability on unseen objects. The accuracy of the generated hand trajectories is confirmed in a physics simulation setting, showcasing the authenticity of the created sequences and their applicability in downstream uses.</p></details> |  |

To enable successful robot operation in such settings, maps must be constructed so that they include semantic information, in addition to geometric information. In this paper, we address the novel problem of semantic exploration, whereby a mobile robot must autonomously explore an environment to fully map both its structure and the semantic appearance of features. We develop a method based on next-best-view exploration, where potential poses are scored based on the semantic features visible from that pose. We explore two alternative methods for sampling potential views and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulation and physical experiments. Automatic creation of high-quality semantic maps can enable robots to better understand and interact with their environments and enable future embodied AI applications to be more easily deployed.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Although Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)-based methods perform well in offline RL, their high computational and energy demands motivate exploration of more efficient alternatives. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) show promise for such tasks, given their low power consumption. In this work, we introduce DSFormer, the first spike-driven transformer model designed to tackle offline RL via sequence modeling. Unlike existing SNN transformers focused on spatial dimensions for vision tasks, we develop Temporal Spiking Self-Attention (TSSA) and Positional Spiking Self-Attention (PSSA) in DSFormer to capture the temporal and positional dependencies essential for sequence modeling in RL. Additionally, we propose Progressive Threshold-dependent Batch Normalization (PTBN), which combines the benefits of LayerNorm and BatchNorm to preserve temporal dependencies while maintaining the spiking nature of SNNs. Comprehensive results in the D4RL benchmark show DSFormer's superiority over both SNN and ANN counterparts, achieving 78.4% energy savings, highlighting DSFormer's advantages not only in energy efficiency but also in competitive performance.

Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Despite encouraging progress, current methods mainly focus on developing separate controllers, each specialized for a specific interaction task. This significantly hinders the ability to tackle a wide variety of challenging HSI tasks that require the integration of multiple skills, e.g., sitting down while carrying an object. To address this issue, we present TokenHSI, a single, unified transformer-based policy capable of multi-skill unification and flexible adaptation. The key insight is to model the humanoid proprioception as a separate shared token and combine it with distinct task tokens via a masking mechanism. Such a unified policy enables effective knowledge sharing across skills, thereby facilitating the multi-task training. Moreover, our policy architecture supports variable length inputs, enabling flexible adaptation of learned skills to new scenarios. By training additional task tokenizers, we can not only modify the geometries of interaction targets but also coordinate multiple skills to address complex tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve versatility, adaptability, and extensibility in various HSI tasks.

However, current multimodal retrieval tasks lack sufficient complexity and demonstrate limited practical application value. It spires us to design Instance-Driven Multimodal Image Retrieval (IDMR), a novel task that requires models to retrieve images containing the same instance as a query image while matching a text-described scenario. Unlike existing retrieval tasks focused on global image similarity or category-level matching, IDMR demands fine-grained instance-level consistency across diverse contexts. To benchmark this capability, we develop IDMR-bench using real-world object tracking and first-person video data. Addressing the scarcity of training data, we propose a cross-domain synthesis method that creates 557K training samples by cropping objects from standard detection datasets. Our Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based retrieval model, trained on 1.2M samples, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both traditional benchmarks and our zero-shot IDMR-bench. Experimental results demonstrate previous models' limitations in instance-aware retrieval and highlight the potential of MLLM for advanced retrieval applications.

To address this, we propose a novel framework that bridges embodied cognition theory and agent systems by leveraging a formal characterization of image schemas, which are defined as recurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. By customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create a neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental conceptual structures. We argue that such an approach enhances both efficiency and interpretability while enabling more intuitive human-agent interactions through shared embodied understanding.</p></details> |  |

Data-driven embodied AI algorithms demand precise, large-scale, human-like manipulation sequences, which are challenging to obtain with conventional reinforcement learning or real-world teleoperation. To address this, we introduce ManipTrans, a novel two-stage method for efficiently transferring human bimanual skills to dexterous robotic hands in simulation. ManipTrans first pre-trains a generalist trajectory imitator to mimic hand motion, then fine-tunes a specific residual module under interaction constraints, enabling efficient learning and accurate execution of complex bimanual tasks. Experiments show that ManipTrans surpasses state-of-the-art methods in success rate, fidelity, and efficiency. Leveraging ManipTrans, we transfer multiple hand-object datasets to robotic hands, creating DexManipNet, a large-scale dataset featuring previously unexplored tasks like pen capping and bottle unscrewing. DexManipNet comprises 3.3K episodes of robotic manipulation and is easily extensible, facilitating further policy training for dexterous hands and enabling real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

While AVs rely on sensor systems such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar to detect obstacles, this study suggests combining sensors with a knowledge graph (KG)-based world model to improve AVs' comprehension of physical material qualities. Beyond sensor data, AVs can infer qualities such as malleability, density, and elasticity using a semantic KG that depicts the relationships between obstacles and their attributes. Using the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, we evaluated AV performance with and without KG integration. The findings demonstrate that the KG-based method improves obstacle management, which allows AVs to use material qualities to make better decisions about when to change lanes or apply emergency braking. For example, the KG-integrated AV changed lanes for hard impediments like traffic cones and successfully avoided collisions with flexible items such as plastic bags by passing over them. Compared to the control system, the KG framework demonstrated improved responsiveness to obstacles by resolving conflicting sensor data, causing emergency stops for 13.3% more cases. In addition, our method exhibits a 6.6% higher success rate in lane-changing maneuvers in experimental scenarios, particularly for larger, high-impact obstacles. While we focus particularly on autonomous driving, our work demonstrates the potential of KG-based world models to improve decision-making in embodied AI systems and scale to other domains, including robotics, healthcare, and environmental simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Reasoning Video Segmentation with Just-in-Time Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21056v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning segmentation (RS) aims to identify and segment objects of interest based on implicit text queries. As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI agents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring explicit step-by-step guidance. However, current RS approaches rely heavily on the visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs), leading to several major limitations. First, they struggle with queries that require multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex spatial/temporal relationships. Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which may require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs and may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Finally, being primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they scale poorly to online video data. To address these limitations, we propose an agent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS without LLM fine-tuning. Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time digital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- a LLM plans the construction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using specialist vision models. We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin as "just-in-time" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific information and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating every specialist model. The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin representation to identify target objects. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new comprehensive video reasoning segmentation benchmark comprising 200 videos with 895 implicit text queries. The benchmark spans three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal) with three different reasoning chain complexity.</p></details> |  |

Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the DataPlatter method, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.</p></details> |  |

The challenge encompasses the precise definition of an AI body and the intricate task of identifying embodiments in dynamic environments, where conventional approaches often prove inadequate. To address these challenges, we apply causal inference method and evaluate it by developing a simulator tailored for testing algorithms with virtual environments. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical testing, demonstrating their robust performance in various scenarios based on virtual environments.</p></details> |  |

In the context of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), RAG has proven invaluable by augmenting model outputs with supplementary, relevant information, thus improving their quality. Recently, the potential of RAG has extended beyond natural language processing, with emerging methods integrating retrieval-augmented strategies into the computer vision (CV) domain. These approaches aim to address the limitations of relying solely on internal model knowledge by incorporating authoritative external knowledge bases, thereby improving both the understanding and generation capabilities of vision models. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV, focusing on two main areas: (I) visual understanding and (II) visual generation. In the realm of visual understanding, we systematically review tasks ranging from basic image recognition to complex applications such as medical report generation and multimodal question answering. For visual content generation, we examine the application of RAG in tasks related to image, video, and 3D generation. Furthermore, we explore recent advancements in RAG for embodied AI, with a particular focus on applications in planning, task execution, multimodal perception, interaction, and specialized domains. Given that the integration of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV is still in its early stages, we also highlight the key limitations of current approaches and propose future research directions to drive the development of this promising area.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |

Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and tailored 3D scene understanding designs. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation.

Our key insight is to distill human-scene interactions from state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data.

Traditional weak augmentations, such as cropping and flipping, are insufficient for improving a model's performance in new environments. Existing data augmentation methods often disrupt task-relevant information in images, potentially degrading performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EAGLE, an efficient training framework for generalizable visuomotor policies that improves upon existing methods by (1) enhancing generalization by applying augmentation only to control-related regions identified through a self-supervised control-aware mask and (2) improving training stability and efficiency by distilling knowledge from an expert to a visuomotor student policy, which is then deployed to unseen environments without further fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on three domains, including the DMControl Generalization Benchmark, the enhanced Robot Manipulation Distraction Benchmark, and a long-sequential drawer-opening task, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KARMA's plug-and-play capability allows for seamless deployment on real-world robotic systems, such as mobile manipulation platforms.Through this plug-and-play memory system, KARMA significantly enhances the ability of embodied agents to generate coherent and contextually appropriate plans, making the execution of complex household tasks more efficient.

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities, their adaptation to 3D environments (3D-LLMs) remains in its early stages. A primary challenge is a lack of large-scale datasets with dense grounding between language and 3D scenes. We introduce 3D-GRAND, a pioneering large-scale dataset comprising 40,087 household scenes paired with 6.2 million densely-grounded scene-language instructions.

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MoK-RAG, a novel multi-source RAG framework that implements a mixture of knowledge paths enhanced retrieval mechanism through functional partitioning of a large language model (LLM) corpus into distinct sections, enabling retrieval from multiple specialized knowledge paths. Applied to the generation of 3D simulated environments, our proposed MoK-RAG3D enhances this paradigm by partitioning 3D assets into distinct sections and organizing them based on a hierarchical knowledge tree structure. Different from previous methods that only use manual evaluation, we pioneered the introduction of automated evaluation methods for 3D scenes. Both automatic and human evaluations in our experiments demonstrate that MoK-RAG3D can assist Embodied AI agents in generating diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods for creating articulated objects are either data-driven or simulation based, which are limited by the scale and quality of the training data or the fidelity and heavy labour of the simulation. In this paper, we propose Infinite Mobility, a novel method for synthesizing high-fidelity articulated objects through procedural generation. User study and quantitative evaluation demonstrate that our method can produce results that excel current state-of-the-art methods and are comparable to human-annotated datasets in both physics property and mesh quality. Furthermore, we show that our synthetic data can be used as training data for generative models, enabling next-step scaling up.

| **[Exploring 3D Activity Reasoning and Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D activity reasoning and planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advance in multimodal learning. However, most existing works share two constraints: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. To bridge the gaps, we propose 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans, and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[HIS-GPT: Towards 3D Human-In-Scene Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12955v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new task to benchmark human-in-scene understanding for embodied agents: Human-In-Scene Question Answering (HIS-QA). Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the static to openable (S2O) task which creates interactive articulated 3D objects from static counterparts through openable part detection, motion prediction, and interior geometry completion. We formulate a unified framework to tackle this task, and curate a challenging dataset of openable 3D objects that serves as a test bed for systematic evaluation. Our experiments benchmark methods from prior work, extended and improved methods, and simple yet effective heuristics for the S2O task. We find that turning static 3D objects into interactively openable counterparts is possible but that all methods struggle to generalize to realistic settings of the task, and we highlight promising future work directions. Our work enables efficient creation of interactive 3D objects for robotic manipulation and embodied AI tasks.</p></details> |  |

Many navigation approaches primarily define success by proximity to the target, often overlooking the necessity for optimal positioning that facilitates subsequent manipulation. To address this, we introduce MoMa-Kitchen, a benchmark dataset comprising over 100k samples that provide training data for models to learn optimal final navigation positions for seamless transition to manipulation. Our dataset includes affordance-grounded floor labels collected from diverse kitchen environments, in which robotic mobile manipulators of different models attempt to grasp target objects amidst clutter. Using a fully automated pipeline, we simulate diverse real-world scenarios and generate affordance labels for optimal manipulation positions. Visual data are collected from RGB-D inputs captured by a first-person view camera mounted on the robotic arm, ensuring consistency in viewpoint during data collection. We also develop a lightweight baseline model, NavAff, for navigation affordance grounding that demonstrates promising performance on the MoMa-Kitchen benchmark. Our approach enables models to learn affordance-based final positioning that accommodates different arm types and platform heights, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable integration of navigation and manipulation in embodied AI.

| **[Making Every Frame Matter: Continuous Activity Recognition in Streaming Video via Adaptive Video Context Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14993v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video activity recognition has become increasingly important in robots and embodied AI. Recognizing continuous video activities poses considerable challenges due to the fast expansion of streaming video, which contains multi-scale and untrimmed activities. We introduce a novel system, CARS, to overcome these issues through adaptive video context modeling. Adaptive video context modeling refers to selectively maintaining activity-related features in temporal and spatial dimensions. CARS has two key designs. The first is an activity spatial feature extraction by eliminating irrelevant visual features while maintaining recognition accuracy. The second is an activity-aware state update introducing dynamic adaptability to better preserve the video context for multi-scale activity recognition. Our CARS runs at speeds $>$30 FPS on typical edge devices and outperforms all baselines by 1.2\% to 79.7\% in accuracy. Moreover, we explore applying CARS to a large video model as a video encoder. Experimental results show that our CARS can result in a 0.46-point enhancement (on a 5-point scale) on the in-distribution video activity dataset, and an improvement ranging from 1.19\% to 4\% on zero-shot video activity datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Long-horizon Embodied Planning with Implicit Logical Inference and Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15658v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon embodied planning underpins embodied AI. To accomplish long-horizon tasks, one of the most feasible ways is to decompose abstract instructions into a sequence of actionable steps. Foundation models still face logical errors and hallucinations in long-horizon planning, unless provided with highly relevant examples to the tasks. However, providing highly relevant examples for any random task is unpractical. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a novel framework for Real-time Long-horizon Embodied Planning. ReLEP can complete a wide range of long-horizon tasks without in-context examples by learning implicit logical inference through fine-tuning. The fine-tuned large vision-language model formulates plans as sequences of skill functions. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. When constructing the dataset, we considered the implicit logical relationships, enabling the model to learn implicit logical relationships and dispel hallucinations. Through comprehensive evaluations across various long-horizon tasks, ReLEP demonstrates high success rates and compliance to execution even on unseen tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

The high cost of commercial mobile manipulation robots significantly limits research in real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose AhaRobot, a low-cost and fully open-source dual-arm mobile manipulation robot system with a hardware cost of only $1,000 (excluding optional computational resources), which is less than 1/15 of the cost of popular mobile robots. The AhaRobot system consists of three components: (1) a novel low-cost hardware architecture primarily composed of off-the-shelf components, (2) an optimized control solution to enhance operational precision integrating dual-motor backlash control and static friction compensation, and (3) a simple remote teleoperation method RoboPilot. We use handles to control the dual arms and pedals for whole-body movement. The teleoperation process is low-burden and easy to operate, much like piloting. RoboPilot is designed for remote data collection in embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboPilot significantly enhances data collection efficiency in complex manipulation tasks, achieving a 30% increase compared to methods using 3D mouse and leader-follower systems. It also excels at completing extremely long-horizon tasks in one go. Furthermore, AhaRobot can be used to learn end-to-end policies and autonomously perform complex manipulation tasks, such as pen insertion and cleaning up the floor. We aim to build an affordable yet powerful platform to promote the development of embodied tasks on real devices, advancing more robust and reliable embodied AI.

Current screen based chat-bots do not take advantage of the the full-suite of natural inputs available in XR, including inward facing sensor data, instead they over-rely on explicit voice or text prompts, sometimes paired with multi-modal data dropped as part of the query. We propose a solution that leverages an attention framework that derives context implicitly from user actions, eye-gaze, and contextual memory within the XR environment. Our work minimizes the need for engineered explicit prompts, fostering grounded and intuitive interactions that glean user insights for the chat-bot.</p></details> |  |

The system leverages multiple RGBD cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Effectiveness of a Socratic Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning Method for Task Planning in Robotics, A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08174v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in reasoning with natural language. Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks. To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Interactive systems assist humans in these tasks, enabling applications in Embodied AI, human-robot interaction, and virtual reality. However, current methods in hand-object synthesis often neglect dynamics and focus on generating static grasps. The first part of this dissertation introduces dynamic grasp synthesis, where a hand grasps and moves an object to a target pose. We approach this task using physical simulation and reinforcement learning. We then extend this to bimanual manipulation and articulated objects, requiring fine-grained coordination between hands. In the second part of this dissertation, we study human-to-robot handovers. We integrate captured human motion into simulation and introduce a student-teacher framework that adapts to human behavior and transfers from sim to real. To overcome data scarcity, we generate synthetic interactions, increasing training diversity by 100x. Our user study finds no difference between policies trained on synthetic vs. real motions.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |

However, real-world datasets often lack sufficient data for training and evaluation, and synthetic datasets, while larger, lack acoustic realism. Consequently, neither effectively meets practical needs. To address this issue, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit based on the embodied AI simulation platform Habitat-sim, designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim supports multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level adjustments, enabling the creation of more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a benchmark dataset called SonicSet, utilizing LibriSpeech, Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K), Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to investigate the differences between synthetic and real-world data, we selected 5 hours of raw, non-reverberant data from the SonicSet validation set and recorded a real-world speech separation dataset, providing a reference for comparing SonicSet with other synthetic datasets. For speech enhancement, we utilized the real-world dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between SonicSet and existing synthetic datasets. The results indicate that models trained on SonicSet generalize better to real-world scenarios compared to other synthetic datasets.

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks.

As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration.

Affordance indicates where and how to grasp an object by taking its functionality into account, serving as the foundation for effective task-oriented grasping. However, current task-oriented methods often depend on extensive training data that is confined to specific tasks and objects, making it difficult to generalize to novel objects and complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce AffordGrasp, a novel open-vocabulary grasping framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) for in-context affordance reasoning. Unlike existing methods that rely on explicit task and object specifications, our approach infers tasks directly from implicit user instructions, enabling more intuitive and seamless human-robot interaction in everyday scenarios. Building on the reasoning outcomes, our framework identifies task-relevant objects and grounds their part-level affordances using a visual grounding module. This allows us to generate task-oriented grasp poses precisely within the affordance regions of the object, ensuring both functional and context-aware robotic manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. We believe our approach advances robotic manipulation techniques and contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://eqcy.github.io/affordgrasp/.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning.

First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of prior magical grasp implementations at a fraction of the GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |
| **[Towards Robust and Secure Embodied AI: A Survey on Vulnerabilities and Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13175v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, including robots and autonomous vehicles, are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, where they encounter a range of vulnerabilities stemming from both environmental and system-level factors. These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Pattern Recognition Letters.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, when powered by open LLMs, they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a multicomponent memory system. In Minecraft experiments, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks where traditional Voyager fails without GPT-4, collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items and achieving $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones, advancing from basic wood tools to advanced iron equipment. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated collaborative experiences. MindForge advances the democratization of embodied AI development through open-ended social learning, enabling peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.</p></details> |  |

Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |

Recent advances in foundation models pave the way for generative agents capable of richer communication and adaptive problem-solving. This survey provides a systematic examination of how EMAS can benefit from these generative capabilities. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes EMAS by system architectures and embodiment modalities, emphasizing how collaboration spans both physical and virtual contexts. Central building blocks, perception, planning, communication, and feedback, are then analyzed to illustrate how generative techniques bolster system robustness and flexibility. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the transformative effects of integrating foundation models into embodied, multi-agent frameworks. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions, underlining the significant promise of EMAS to reshape the landscape of AI-driven collaboration.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We propose a novel object-centric latent action learning approach, based on VideoSaur and LAPO, that employs self-supervised decomposition of scenes into object representations and annotates video data with proxy-action labels. This method effectively disentangles causal agent-object interactions from irrelevant background noise and reduces the performance degradation of latent action learning approaches caused by distractors. Our preliminary experiments with the Distracting Control Suite show that latent action pretraining based on object decompositions improve the quality of inferred latent actions by x2.7 and efficiency of downstream fine-tuning with a small set of labeled actions, increasing return by x2.6 on average.</p></details> | Preprint.

However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

Yet ensuring dynamic safety, i.e., constraint satisfaction, remains challenging for such policies. Reinforcement learning (RL) embeds constraints heuristically through reward engineering, and adding or modifying constraints requires retraining. Model-based approaches, like control barrier functions (CBFs), enable runtime constraint specification with formal guarantees but require accurate dynamics models. This paper presents SHIELD, a layered safety framework that bridges this gap by: (1) training a generative, stochastic dynamics residual model using real-world data from hardware rollouts of the nominal controller, capturing system behavior and uncertainties; and (2) adding a safety layer on top of the nominal (learned locomotion) controller that leverages this model via a stochastic discrete-time CBF formulation enforcing safety constraints in probability. The result is a minimally-invasive safety layer that can be added to the existing autonomy stack to give probabilistic guarantees of safety that balance risk and performance. In hardware experiments on an Unitree G1 humanoid, SHIELD enables safe navigation (obstacle avoidance) through varied indoor and outdoor environments using a nominal (unknown) RL controller and onboard perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video at https://vimeo.com/1061676063</p></details> |

This work investigates whether LLMs can optimize the performance of assembly code, where fine-grained control over execution enables improvements that are difficult to express in high-level languages. We present a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a reward function that considers both functional correctness, validated through test cases, and execution performance relative to the industry-standard compiler gcc -O3. To support this study, we introduce a benchmark of 8,072 real-world programs. Our model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO, achieves 96.0% test pass rates and an average speedup of 1.47x over the gcc -O3 baseline, outperforming all 20 other models evaluated, including Claude-3.7-sonnet. These results indicate that reinforcement learning can unlock the potential of LLMs to serve as effective optimizers for assembly code performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Reward Shaping from Confounded Offline Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11478v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures. Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved confounders exist.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, applying RL in real-world trading tasks remains challenging due to the non-stationarity of financial data, low signal-to-noise ratios, and various market frictions. Although numerous FinRL methods have been developed for tasks such as trading and portfolio management, the lack of standardized task definitions, datasets, environments, and baselines has hindered consistent evaluation and reproducibility. To bridge this gap, we organized three FinRL Contests from 2023 to 2025, covering a diverse range of financial tasks such as stock trading, order execution, cryptocurrency trading, and the use of large language model (LLM)-generated signals. These contests attracted 200 participants from over 100 institutions across 22 countries. To promote reproduction, we provided open-source starter kits featuring GPU-optimized parallel market environments and comprehensive documentation. In this paper, we summarize these benchmarking efforts, detailing task formulations, data curation pipelines, environment implementations, evaluation protocols, participant performance, and key organizational insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2501.10709</p></details> |

Each subsequent data release raises expectations for future data collection, meaning there is a constant need to advance the quality and diversity of openly available preference data. To address this need, we introduce HelpSteer3-Preference, a permissively licensed (CC-BY-4.0), high-quality, human-annotated preference dataset comprising of over 40,000 samples. These samples span diverse real-world applications of large language models (LLMs), including tasks relating to STEM, coding and multilingual scenarios. Using HelpSteer3-Preference, we train Reward Models (RMs) that achieve top performance on RM-Bench (82.4%) and JudgeBench (73.7%). This represents a substantial improvement (~10% absolute) over the previously best-reported results from existing RMs. We demonstrate HelpSteer3-Preference can also be applied to train Generative RMs and how policy models can be aligned with RLHF using our RMs. Dataset (CC-BY-4.0): https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer3#preference</p></details> | 38 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Exploratory Diffusion Model for Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07279v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to pre-train agents by exploring diverse states or skills in reward-free environments, facilitating efficient adaptation to downstream tasks. As the agent cannot access extrinsic rewards during unsupervised exploration, existing methods design intrinsic rewards to model the explored data and encourage further exploration. However, the explored data are always heterogeneous, posing the requirements of powerful representation abilities for both intrinsic reward models and pre-trained policies. In this work, we propose the Exploratory Diffusion Model (ExDM), which leverages the strong expressive ability of diffusion models to fit the explored data, simultaneously boosting exploration and providing an efficient initialization for downstream tasks. Specifically, ExDM can accurately estimate the distribution of collected data in the replay buffer with the diffusion model and introduces the score-based intrinsic reward, encouraging the agent to explore less-visited states. After obtaining the pre-trained policies, ExDM enables rapid adaptation to downstream tasks. In detail, we provide theoretical analyses and practical algorithms for fine-tuning diffusion policies, addressing key challenges such as training instability and computational complexity caused by multi-step sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExDM outperforms existing SOTA baselines in efficient unsupervised exploration and fast fine-tuning downstream tasks, especially in structurally complicated environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Reasoning and Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11462v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians' diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, m1 scores 60.5 on knowledge but only 47.1 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Signal attenuation enables scalable decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning over networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11461v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods require that agents enjoy global state observability, preventing development of decentralized algorithms and limiting scalability. Recent work has shown that, under assumptions on decaying inter-agent influence, global observability can be replaced by local neighborhood observability at each agent, enabling decentralization and scalability. Real-world applications enjoying such decay properties remain underexplored, however, despite the fact that signal power decay, or signal attenuation, due to path loss is an intrinsic feature of many problems in wireless communications and radar networks. In this paper, we show that signal attenuation enables decentralization in MARL by considering the illustrative special case of performing power allocation for target detection in a radar network. To achieve this, we propose two new constrained multi-agent Markov decision process formulations of this power allocation problem, derive local neighborhood approximations for global value function and gradient estimates and establish corresponding error bounds, and develop decentralized saddle point policy gradient algorithms for solving the proposed problems. Our approach, though oriented towards the specific radar network problem we consider, provides a useful model for future extensions to additional problems in wireless communications and radar networks.</p></details> | 7 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Visual Planning: Let's Think Only with Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11409v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have substantially enhanced machine reasoning across diverse tasks. However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for both expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is present. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most natural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving spatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new paradigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual representations, independent of text. In this paradigm, planning is executed via sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual domain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement Learning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models, leading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of representative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our visual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct reasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a viable and promising alternative to language-based reasoning, opening new avenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 1 table (26 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |

However, pathology still remains a more challenging subdomain, with current pathology specific VLMs exhibiting limitations in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning plausibility. Such shortcomings are largely attributable to the nature of current pathology datasets, which are primarily composed of image description pairs that lack the depth and structured diagnostic paradigms employed by real world pathologists. In this study, we leverage pathology textbooks and real world pathology experts to construct high-quality, reasoning-oriented datasets. Building on this, we introduce Patho-R1, a multimodal RL-based pathology Reasoner, trained through a three-stage pipeline: (1) continued pretraining on 3.5 million image-text pairs for knowledge infusion; (2) supervised fine-tuning on 500k high-quality Chain-of-Thought samples for reasoning incentivizing; (3) reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization and Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization strategies for multimodal reasoning quality refinement. To further assess the alignment quality of our dataset, we propose PathoCLIP, trained on the same figure-caption corpus used for continued pretraining. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that both PathoCLIP and Patho-R1 achieve robust performance across a wide range of pathology-related tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, Visual Question Answering, and Multiple Choice Question.

We view scaffolded LMs as semi-parametric models wherein we train non-parametric variables, including the prompt, tools, and scaffold's code. In particular, they interpret instructions, use tools, and receive feedback all in language. Recent works use an LM as an optimizer to interpret language supervision and update non-parametric variables according to intricate objectives. In this survey, we refer to this paradigm as training of scaffolded LMs with language supervision. A key feature of non-parametric training is the ability to learn from language. Parametric training excels in learning from demonstration (supervised learning), exploration (reinforcement learning), or observations (unsupervised learning), using well-defined loss functions. Language-based optimization enables rich, interpretable, and expressive objectives, while mitigating issues like catastrophic forgetting and supporting compatibility with closed-source models. Furthermore, agents are increasingly deployed as co-workers in real-world applications such as Copilot in Office tools or software development. In these mixed-autonomy settings, where control and decision-making are shared between human and AI, users point out errors or suggest corrections. Accordingly, we discuss agents that continuously improve by learning from this real-time, language-based feedback and refer to this setting as streaming learning from language supervision.</p></details> |  |

However, learning a robust world model often requires complex and deep architectures, which are computationally expensive and challenging to train. Within the world model, sequence models play a critical role in accurate predictions, and various architectures have been explored, each with its own challenges. Currently, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based world models struggle with vanishing gradients and capturing long-term dependencies. Transformers, on the other hand, suffer from the quadratic memory and computational complexity of self-attention mechanisms, scaling as $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the sequence length. To address these challenges, we propose a state space model (SSM)-based world model, Drama, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves $O(n)$ memory and computational complexity while effectively capturing long-term dependencies and enabling efficient training with longer sequences. We also introduce a novel sampling method to mitigate the suboptimality caused by an incorrect world model in the early training stages. Combining these techniques, Drama achieves a normalised score on the Atari100k benchmark that is competitive with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) model-based RL algorithms, using only a 7 million-parameter world model. Drama is accessible and trainable on off-the-shelf hardware, such as a standard laptop.

| **[Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks. Similar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies, RLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In this study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various model families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric. Surprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher pass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the observed reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model. Treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in leveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to elicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for improved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.</p></details> | 30 pages, 27 figures |
| **[Learning Multimodal AI Algorithms for Amplifying Limited User Input into High-dimensional Control Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11366v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current invasive assistive technologies are designed to infer high-dimensional motor control signals from severely paralyzed patients. However, they face significant challenges, including public acceptance, limited longevity, and barriers to commercialization. Meanwhile, noninvasive alternatives often rely on artifact-prone signals, require lengthy user training, and struggle to deliver robust high-dimensional control for dexterous tasks. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel human-centered multimodal AI approach as intelligent compensatory mechanisms for lost motor functions that could potentially enable patients with severe paralysis to control high-dimensional assistive devices, such as dexterous robotic arms, using limited and noninvasive inputs. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art (SoTA) noninvasive approaches, our context-aware, multimodal shared-autonomy framework integrates deep reinforcement learning algorithms to blend limited low-dimensional user input with real-time environmental perception, enabling adaptive, dynamic, and intelligent interpretation of human intent for complex dexterous manipulation tasks, such as pick-and-place. The results from our ARAS (Adaptive Reinforcement learning for Amplification of limited inputs in Shared autonomy) trained with synthetic users over 50,000 computer simulation episodes demonstrated the first successful implementation of the proposed closed-loop human-in-the-loop paradigm, outperforming the SoTA shared autonomy algorithms. Following a zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, ARAS was evaluated on 23 human subjects, demonstrating high accuracy in dynamic intent detection and smooth, stable 3D trajectory control for dexterous pick-and-place tasks. ARAS user study achieved a high task success rate of 92.88%, with short completion times comparable to those of SoTA invasive assistive technologies.</p></details> |  |

However, its practical deployment in sensitive military contexts is constrained by the lack of explainability, which is an essential factor for trust, safety, and alignment with human strategies. This work reviews and assesses current advances in explainability methods for MARL with a focus on simulated air combat scenarios. We proceed by adapting various explainability techniques to different aerial combat scenarios to gain explanatory insights about the model behavior. By linking AI-generated tactics with human-understandable reasoning, we emphasize the need for transparency to ensure reliable deployment and meaningful human-machine interaction. By illuminating the crucial importance of explainability in advancing MARL for operational defense, our work supports not only strategic planning but also the training of military personnel with insightful and comprehensible analyses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a journal chapter in NATO Journal of Science and Technology</p></details> |

Despite recent advances in computational science, solving such PDEs for real-world applications remains prohibitively expensive because of the necessity of resolving a broad range of spatiotemporal scales. In turn, practitioners often rely on coarse-grained approximations of the original PDEs, trading off accuracy for reduced computational resources. To mitigate the loss of detail inherent in such approximations, closure models are employed to represent unresolved spatiotemporal interactions. We present a framework for developing closure models for PDEs using synthetic data acquired through the method of manufactured solutions. These data are used in conjunction with reinforcement learning to provide closures for coarse-grained PDEs. We illustrate the efficacy of our method using the one-dimensional and two-dimensional Burgers' equations and the two-dimensional advection equation. Moreover, we demonstrate that closure models trained for inhomogeneous PDEs can be effectively generalized to homogeneous PDEs. The results demonstrate the potential for developing accurate and computationally efficient closure models for systems with scarce data.</p></details> |  |

We leverage a Growing-Window estimator sampling from interactions with the uncertain and dynamic environment to estimate the thresholds, based on which we design Stochastic Pessimistic-Optimistic Thresholding (SPOT), a novel model-based primal-dual algorithm for multiple constraints against stochastic thresholds. SPOT enables reinforcement learning under both pessimistic and optimistic threshold settings. We prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret and constraint violation; i.e., a reward regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ while allowing an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ constraint violation over $T$ episodes. The theoretical guarantees show that our algorithm achieves performance comparable to that of an approach relying on fixed and clear thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, SPOT is the first reinforcement learning algorithm that realises theoretical guaranteed performance in an uncertain environment where even thresholds are unknown.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-augmented reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information, hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new ``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[SelfBudgeter: Adaptive Token Allocation for Efficient LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11274v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large reasoning models demonstrate exceptional performance on various tasks. However, reasoning models inefficiently over-process both trivial and complex queries, leading to resource waste and prolonged user latency. To address this challenge, we propose SelfBudgeter - a self-adaptive controllable reasoning strategy for efficient reasoning. Our approach adopts a dual-phase training paradigm: first, the model learns to pre-estimate the reasoning cost based on the difficulty of the query. Then, we introduce budget-guided GPRO for reinforcement learning, which effectively maintains accuracy while reducing output length. SelfBudgeter allows users to anticipate generation time and make informed decisions about continuing or interrupting the process. Furthermore, our method enables direct manipulation of reasoning length via pre-filling token budget. Experimental results demonstrate that SelfBudgeter can rationally allocate budgets according to problem complexity, achieving up to 74.47% response length compression on the MATH benchmark while maintaining nearly undiminished accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZeroSearch: Incentivize the Search Capability of LLMs without Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04588v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective information searching is essential for enhancing the reasoning and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent research has explored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities by interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these approaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1) Uncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search engines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the training process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires frequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search requests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a novel RL framework that incentivizes the capabilities of LLMs to use a real search engine with simulated searches during training. Our approach begins with lightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module capable of generating both useful and noisy documents in response to a query. During RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that incrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively eliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly challenging retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ZeroSearch effectively incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs using a 3B LLM as the retrieval module. Remarkably, a 7B retrieval module achieves comparable performance to the real search engine, while a 14B retrieval module even surpasses it. Furthermore, it generalizes well across both base and instruction-tuned models of various parameter sizes and is compatible with a wide range of RL algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is PRM Necessary? Problem-Solving RL Implicitly Induces PRM Capability in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11227v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of reasoning capabilities represents a critical frontier in large language models (LLMs) research, where reinforcement learning (RL) and process reward models (PRMs) have emerged as predominant methodological frameworks. Contrary to conventional wisdom, empirical evidence from DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that pure RL training focused on mathematical problem-solving can progressively enhance reasoning abilities without PRM integration, challenging the perceived necessity of process supervision. In this study, we conduct a systematic investigation of the relationship between RL training and PRM capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that problem-solving proficiency and process supervision capabilities represent complementary dimensions of reasoning that co-evolve synergistically during pure RL training. In particular, current PRMs underperform simple baselines like majority voting when applied to state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B. To address this limitation, we propose Self-PRM, an introspective framework in which models autonomously evaluate and rerank their generated solutions through self-reward mechanisms. Although Self-PRM consistently improves the accuracy of the benchmark (particularly with larger sample sizes), analysis exposes persistent challenges: The approach exhibits low precision (<10\%) on difficult problems, frequently misclassifying flawed solutions as valid. These analyses underscore the need for continued RL scaling to improve reward alignment and introspective accuracy. Overall, our findings suggest that PRM may not be essential for enhancing complex reasoning, as pure RL not only improves problem-solving skills but also inherently fosters robust PRM capabilities. We hope these findings provide actionable insights for building more reliable and self-aware complex reasoning models.</p></details> |  |

However, due to patient data privacy concerns and computational costs, many healthcare providers prefer using small, locally-hosted models over external generic LLMs. This study presents a comprehensive domain- and task-specific adaptation process for the open-source LLaMA-2 13 billion parameter model, enabling it to generate high-quality clinical notes from outpatient patient-doctor dialogues. Our process incorporates continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from both AI and human feedback. We introduced a new approach, DistillDirect, for performing on-policy reinforcement learning with Gemini 1.0 Pro as the teacher model. Our resulting model, LLaMA-Clinic, can generate clinical notes comparable in quality to those authored by physicians. In a blinded physician reader study, the majority (90.4%) of individual evaluations rated the notes generated by LLaMA-Clinic as "acceptable" or higher across all three criteria: real-world readiness, completeness, and accuracy. In the more challenging "Assessment and Plan" section, LLaMA-Clinic scored higher (4.2/5) in real-world readiness than physician-authored notes (4.1/5). We highlight key considerations for future clinical note-generation tasks, emphasizing the importance of pre-defining a best-practice note format, rather than relying on LLMs to determine this for clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

However, their large parameters make real-world deployment resource-intensive and often impractical for constrained systems. Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for task-specific agents but suffers from high sample complexity, limiting practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce LVLM to Policy (LVLM2P), a novel framework that distills knowledge from large vision-language models (LVLM) into more efficient RL agents. Our approach leverages the LVLM as a teacher, providing instructional actions based on trajectories collected by the RL agent, which helps reduce less meaningful exploration in the early stages of learning, thereby significantly accelerating the agent's learning progress. Additionally, by leveraging the LVLM to suggest actions directly from visual observations, we eliminate the need for manual textual descriptors of the environment, enhancing applicability across diverse tasks. Experiments show that LVLM2P significantly enhances the sample efficiency of baseline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, ICASSP 2025.

To achieve commercial-grade reliability, iterative manual design revisions and extensive statistical simulations are required. While several studies have aimed to automate variation aware analog design to reduce time-to-market, the substantial mismatches in real-world wafers have not been thoroughly addressed. In this paper, we present GLOVA, an analog circuit sizing framework that effectively manages the impact of diverse random mismatches to improve robustness against PVT variations. In the proposed approach, risk-sensitive reinforcement learning is leveraged to account for the reliability bound affected by PVT variations, and ensemble-based critic is introduced to achieve sample-efficient learning. For design verification, we also propose $\mu$-$\sigma$ evaluation and simulation reordering method to reduce simulation costs of identifying failed designs. GLOVA supports verification through industrial-level PVT variation evaluation methods, including corner simulation as well as global and local Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Compared to previous state-of-the-art variation-aware analog sizing frameworks, GLOVA achieves up to 80.5$\times$ improvement in sample efficiency and 76.0$\times$ reduction in time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for DAC 2025</p></details> |

However, current control methods often struggle to generalize across diverse, unstructured environments. This paper introduces a novel framework for agile locomotion of legged robots by combining multi-expert distillation with reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning to achieve robust generalization. Initially, terrain-specific expert policies are trained to develop specialized locomotion skills. These policies are then distilled into a unified foundation policy via the DAgger algorithm. The distilled policy is subsequently fine-tuned using RL on a broader terrain set, including real-world 3D scans. The framework allows further adaptation to new terrains through repeated fine-tuning. The proposed policy leverages depth images as exteroceptive inputs, enabling robust navigation across diverse, unstructured terrains. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods in synthesizing multi-terrain skills into a single controller. Deployment on the ANYmal D robot validates the policy's ability to navigate complex environments with agility and robustness, setting a new benchmark for legged robot locomotion.</p></details> |  |

Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are commonly used to model these environments, but effective performance requires memory mechanisms to utilise past observations. While recurrence networks have traditionally addressed this need, transformer-based models have recently shown improved sample efficiency in RL tasks. However, their application to POMDPs remains underdeveloped, and their real-world deployment is constrained due to the high parameter count. This work introduces a novel bi-recurrent model architecture that improves sample efficiency and reduces model parameter count in POMDP scenarios. The architecture replaces the multiple feed forward layers with a single layer of bi-directional recurrence unit to better capture and utilize sequential dependencies and contextual information. This approach improves the model's ability to handle partial observability and increases sample efficiency, enabling effective learning from comparatively fewer interactions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model architecture, experiments were conducted on a total of 23 POMDP environments. The proposed model architecture outperforms existing transformer-based, attention-based, and recurrence-based methods by a margin ranging from 87.39% to 482.04% on average across the 23 POMDP environments.</p></details> |  |

RL design involves a wide array of choices that can mostly only be evaluated through lengthy experimentation. Our study focuses on how different reward and action space configurations, ranging from flexible setups to more guided, domain-informed design configurations, affect the agent performance. Using heuristic charging strategies as a baseline, we demonstrate the superiority of flexible, RL-based approaches in terms of service times. Furthermore, our findings highlight a trade-off: While more open-ended designs are able to discover well-performing strategies on their own, they may require longer convergence times and are less stable, whereas guided configurations lead to a more stable learning process but display a more limited generalization potential. Our contributions are threefold. First, we extend SLAPStack, an open-source, RL-compatible simulation-framework to accommodate charging strategies. Second, we introduce a novel RL design for tackling the charging strategy problem. Finally, we introduce several novel adaptive baseline heuristics and reproducibly evaluate the design using a Proximal Policy Optimization agent and varying different design configurations, with a focus on reward.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review LION19: The 19th Learning and Intelligent OptimizatioN Conference</p></details> |

However, commonly used benchmark datasets like the Minifab or SMT2020 lack the complex details and constraints found in real-world scenarios. To mitigate this shortcoming, we compare open-source simulation models with a real industry dataset to evaluate how optimization methods scale with different levels of complexity. Specifically, we focus on Reinforcement Learning methods, performing optimization based on policy-gradient and Evolution Strategies. Our research provides insights into the effectiveness of these optimization methods and their applicability to realistic semiconductor frontend fab simulations. We show that our proposed Evolution Strategies-based method scales much better than a comparable policy-gradient-based approach. Moreover, we identify the selection and combination of relevant bottleneck tools to control by the agent as crucial for an efficient optimization. For the generalization across different loading scenarios and stochastic tool failure patterns, we achieve advantages when utilizing a diverse training dataset. While the overall approach is computationally expensive, it manages to scale well with the number of CPU cores used for training. For the real industry dataset, we achieve an improvement of up to 4% regarding tardiness and up to 1% regarding throughput. For the less complex open-source models Minifab and SMT2020, we observe double-digit percentage improvement in tardiness and single digit percentage improvement in throughput by use of Evolution Strategies.</p></details> |  |

While traditional formulaic alpha mining relies on human expertise, contemporary automated methods, such as those based on genetic programming or reinforcement learning, often suffer from search inefficiency or yield poorly interpretable alpha factors. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to overcome these limitations. Our approach leverages the LLM's instruction-following and reasoning capability to iteratively generate and refine symbolic alpha formulas within an MCTS-driven exploration. A key innovation is the guidance of MCTS exploration by rich, quantitative feedback from financial backtesting of each candidate factor, enabling efficient navigation of the vast search space. Furthermore, a frequent subtree avoidance mechanism is introduced to bolster search efficiency and alpha factor performance. Experimental results on real-world stock market data demonstrate that our LLM-based framework outperforms existing methods by mining alphas with superior predictive accuracy, trading performance, and improved interpretability, while offering a more efficient solution for formulaic alpha mining.</p></details> | 30 pages |

However, existing self-play-based methods are constrained by the limitation of inside-space generalization. In this study, we propose Bidirectional Distillation (BiDist), a novel mixed-play framework, to overcome this limitation in MARL. BiDist leverages knowledge distillation in two alternating directions: forward distillation, which emulates the historical policies' space and creates an implicit self-play, and reverse distillation, which systematically drives agents towards novel distributions outside the known policy space in a non-self-play manner. In addition, BiDist operates as a concise and efficient solution without the need for the complex and costly storage of past policies. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support BiDist's effectiveness. Our results highlight its remarkable generalization ability across a variety of cooperative, competitive, and social dilemma tasks, and reveal that BiDist significantly diversifies the policy distribution space. We also present comprehensive ablation studies to reinforce BiDist's effectiveness and key success factors. Source codes are available in the supplementary material.</p></details> |  |

This approach was naturally favored as it efficiently improves a pretrained LLM, seen as an initial policy. Another RL paradigm, Q-learning methods, has received far less attention in the LLM community while demonstrating major success in various non-LLM RL tasks. In particular, Q-learning effectiveness comes from its sample efficiency and ability to learn offline, which is particularly valuable given the high computational cost of sampling with LLMs. However, naively applying a Q-learning-style update to the model's logits is ineffective due to the specificity of LLMs. Our core contribution is to derive theoretically grounded loss functions from Bellman equations to adapt Q-learning methods to LLMs. To do so, we carefully adapt insights from the RL literature to account for LLM-specific characteristics, ensuring that the logits become reliable Q-value estimates. We then use this loss to build a practical algorithm, ShiQ for Shifted-Q, that supports off-policy, token-wise learning while remaining simple to implement. Finally, we evaluate ShiQ on both synthetic data and real-world benchmarks, e.g., UltraFeedback and BFCL-V3, demonstrating its effectiveness in both single-turn and multi-turn LLM settings</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a health-aware fast charging strategy that explicitly balances charging speed and battery longevity across the entire service life. The key innovation lies in establishing a mapping between anode overpotential and the state of health (SoH) of battery, which is then used to constrain the terminal charging voltage in a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) framework. By incorporating this SoH-dependent voltage constraint, our designed deep learning method mitigates side reactions and effectively extends battery life. To validate the proposed approach, a high-fidelity single particle model with electrolyte is implemented in the widely adopted PyBaMM simulation platform, capturing degradation phenomena at realistic scales. Comparative life-cycle simulations against conventional CC-CV, its variants, and constant current-constant overpotential methods show that the TD3-based controller reduces overall degradation while maintaining competitively fast charge times. These results demonstrate the practical viability of deep reinforcement learning for advanced battery management systems and pave the way for future explorations of health-aware, performance-optimized charging strategies.</p></details> |  |

EPIC learns a shared policy distribution, referred to as the world policy, which enables rapid adaptation to new tasks while retaining valuable knowledge from previous experiences. Our theoretical analysis establishes a relationship between the algorithm's generalization performance and the number of prior tasks preserved in memory.

| **[Provably Efficient Exploration in Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15963v4)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing objective functions subject to constraints is fundamental in many real-world applications. However, these constraints are often not readily defined and must be inferred from expert agent behaviors, a problem known as Inverse Constraint Inference. Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) is a common solver for recovering feasible constraints in complex environments, relying on training samples collected from interactive environments. However, the efficacy and efficiency of current sampling strategies remain unclear. We propose a strategic exploration framework for sampling with guaranteed efficiency to bridge this gap. By defining the feasible cost set for ICRL problems, we analyze how estimation errors in transition dynamics and the expert policy influence the feasibility of inferred constraints. Based on this analysis, we introduce two exploratory algorithms to achieve efficient constraint inference via 1) dynamically reducing the bounded aggregate error of cost estimations or 2) strategically constraining the exploration policy around plausibly optimal ones. Both algorithms are theoretically grounded with tractable sample complexity, and their performance is validated empirically across various environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploration by Random Distribution Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11044v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration remains a critical challenge in online reinforcement learning, as an agent must effectively explore unknown environments to achieve high returns. Currently, the main exploration algorithms are primarily count-based methods and curiosity-based methods, with prediction-error methods being a prominent example. In this paper, we propose a novel method called \textbf{R}andom \textbf{D}istribution \textbf{D}istillation (RDD), which samples the output of a target network from a normal distribution. RDD facilitates a more extensive exploration by explicitly treating the difference between the prediction network and the target network as an intrinsic reward. Furthermore, by introducing randomness into the output of the target network for a given state and modeling it as a sample from a normal distribution, intrinsic rewards are bounded by two key components: a pseudo-count term ensuring proper exploration decay and a discrepancy term accounting for predictor convergence. We demonstrate that RDD effectively unifies both count-based and prediction-error approaches. It retains the advantages of prediction-error methods in high-dimensional spaces, while also implementing an intrinsic reward decay mode akin to the pseudo-count method. In the experimental section, RDD is compared with more advanced methods in a series of environments. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach in improving online exploration for reinforcement learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, humans can effortlessly handle garments, thanks to the dexterity of our hands. However, existing research in the field has struggled to replicate this level of dexterity, primarily hindered by the lack of realistic simulations of dexterous garment manipulation. Therefore, we propose DexGarmentLab, the first environment specifically designed for dexterous (especially bimanual) garment manipulation, which features large-scale high-quality 3D assets for 15 task scenarios, and refines simulation techniques tailored for garment modeling to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Previous data collection typically relies on teleoperation or training expert reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are labor-intensive and inefficient. In this paper, we leverage garment structural correspondence to automatically generate a dataset with diverse trajectories using only a single expert demonstration, significantly reducing manual intervention. However, even extensive demonstrations cannot cover the infinite states of garments, which necessitates the exploration of new algorithms. To improve generalization across diverse garment shapes and deformations, we propose a Hierarchical gArment-manipuLation pOlicy (HALO). It first identifies transferable affordance points to accurately locate the manipulation area, then generates generalizable trajectories to complete the task. Through extensive experiments and detailed analysis of our method and baseline, we demonstrate that HALO consistently outperforms existing methods, successfully generalizing to previously unseen instances even with significant variations in shape and deformation where others fail.

These factors introduce significant decision complexity, which limits the adaptability of existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods. In many DRL algorithms, especially those involving value-based or actor-critic structures, the critic component plays a key role in guiding policy learning by estimating value functions. However, conventional critic models often use shallow architectures that map observations directly to scalar estimates, limiting their ability to handle multi-task complexity. In contrast, recent progress in inference-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown that generating intermediate reasoning steps can significantly improve decision quality. Motivated by this, we propose ReaCritic, a large reasoning transformer-based criticmodel scaling scheme that brings reasoning ability into DRL. ReaCritic performs horizontal reasoning over parallel state-action inputs and vertical reasoning through deep transformer stacks. It is compatible with a broad range of value-based and actor-critic DRL algorithms and enhances generalization in dynamic wireless environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaCritic improves convergence speed and final performance across various HetNet settings and standard OpenAI Gym control tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, optimizing process parameters to balance product quality and profitability under dynamic environmental and economic conditions remains a persistent challenge. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework for real-time process optimization in injection molding, integrating product quality and profitability into the control objective. A profit function was developed to reflect real-world manufacturing costs, incorporating resin, mold wear, and electricity prices, including time-of-use variations. Surrogate models were constructed to predict product quality and cycle time, enabling efficient offline training of DRL agents using soft actor-critic (SAC) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DRL framework can dynamically adapt to seasonal and operational variations, consistently maintaining product quality while maximizing profit. Compared to traditional optimization methods such as genetic algorithms, the DRL models achieved comparable economic performance with up to 135x faster inference speeds, making them well-suited for real-time applications. The framework's scalability and adaptability highlight its potential as a foundation for intelligent, data-driven decision-making in modern manufacturing environments.</p></details> | 50 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Group-in-Group Policy Optimization for LLM Agent Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10978v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in group-based reinforcement learning (RL) have driven frontier large language models (LLMs) in single-turn tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, their scalability to long-horizon LLM agent training remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory, and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level, GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together, enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We evaluate GiGPO on two challenging agent benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, using Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers fine-grained per-step credit signals and achieves performance gains of > 12\% on ALFWorld and > 9\% on WebShop over the GRPO baseline: all while maintaining the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no additional time cost.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Do Theory of Mind Benchmarks Need Explicit Human-like Reasoning in Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01698v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to attribute mental states to others, is fundamental for human social intelligence and a critical capability for advanced Artificial Intelligence. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on ToM benchmarks, raising the question: Do these benchmarks necessitate explicit human-like reasoning processes, or can models succeed through alternative strategies? We investigate this question empirically by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to LLMs of varying scales (0.5B to 7B parameters) and evaluating them across multiple ToM datasets. Our results reveal a scale-dependent impact of RL: while RL significantly improves accuracy and fosters high-quality, interpretable, and transferable belief-tracking reasoning in larger models (7B), it leads to "reasoning collapse" in smaller models ($\leq$3B), where high accuracy and generalization ability are achieved via drastically shortened, less meaningful responses. Surprisingly, further SFT achieves competitive and generalizable performance across these benchmarks, often matching or exceeding RL models in accuracy, despite not being explicitly trained to produce structured reasoning traces. These findings highlight a critical discrepancy between benchmark accuracy and the nature of learned reasoning. Our work suggests that current ToM benchmarks may be solvable without requiring the explicit, human-like simulation of mental states they were designed to probe. LLMs, particularly when scale is limited or training signals focus solely on output correctness, may leverage alternative rules effective for benchmark data structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certifying Stability of Reinforcement Learning Policies using Generalized Lyapunov Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10947v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of certifying the stability of closed-loop systems under control policies derived from optimal control or reinforcement learning (RL). Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict step-wise decrease in the Lyapunov function but such a certificate is difficult to construct for a learned control policy. The value function associated with an RL policy is a natural Lyapunov function candidate but it is not clear how it should be modified. To gain intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms. Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22480v6)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a critical technique for training large language models. However, conventional reward models based on the Bradley-Terry model (BTRM) often suffer from overconfidence when faced with inconsistent labels or out-of-distribution samples, leading to reward hacking, where the policy model blindly optimizes for proxy rewards while degrading true performance. This paper proposes the Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model (PURM), which generalizes the Bradley-Terry model to learn the reward distributions that emerged from the preference data. We theoretically derive the loss function of PURM and introduce a novel method that uses the overlap between distributions to quantify uncertainty. Empirical results show that PURM outperforms existing methods with more accurate reward and sound uncertainty estimations, and sustains effective learning for more optimization steps and obtain higher maximum win rate in RLHF.

Standard reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning methods require expert supervision through human-designed reward functions or demonstrations for every new task. In contrast, ReWiND starts from a small demonstration dataset to learn: (1) a data-efficient, language-conditioned reward function that labels the dataset with rewards, and (2) a language-conditioned policy pre-trained with offline RL using these rewards. Given an unseen task variation, ReWiND fine-tunes the pre-trained policy using the learned reward function, requiring minimal online interaction. We show that ReWiND's reward model generalizes effectively to unseen tasks, outperforming baselines by up to 2.4x in reward generalization and policy alignment metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that ReWiND enables sample-efficient adaptation to new tasks, beating baselines by 2x in simulation and improving real-world pretrained bimanual policies by 5x, taking a step towards scalable, real-world robot learning.

| **[Prior-Guided Diffusion Planning for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10881v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently gained prominence in offline reinforcement learning due to their ability to effectively learn high-performing, generalizable policies from static datasets. Diffusion-based planners facilitate long-horizon decision-making by generating high-quality trajectories through iterative denoising, guided by return-maximizing objectives. However, existing guided sampling strategies such as Classifier Guidance, Classifier-Free Guidance, and Monte Carlo Sample Selection either produce suboptimal multi-modal actions, struggle with distributional drift, or incur prohibitive inference-time costs. To address these challenges, we propose Prior Guidance (PG), a novel guided sampling framework that replaces the standard Gaussian prior of a behavior-cloned diffusion model with a learnable distribution, optimized via a behavior-regularized objective. PG directly generates high-value trajectories without costly reward optimization of the diffusion model itself, and eliminates the need to sample multiple candidates at inference for sample selection. We present an efficient training strategy that applies behavior regularization in latent space, and empirically demonstrate that PG outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies and planners across diverse long-horizon offline RL benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Current evaluation methods often rely on static and resource-intensive datasets that are not aligned with real-world requirements and lack cross-domain adaptability. To address these limitations, we revisit the evaluation process and introduce two key concepts: \textbf{Benchmark+}, which extends the traditional question-answer benchmark into a more flexible ``strategy-criterion'' format; and \textbf{Assessment+}, which enhances the interaction process to facilitate deeper exploration and comprehensive analysis from multiple perspectives. We propose \textbf{\textsc{TestAgent}}, an agent-based evaluation framework that implements these concepts using retrieval-augmented generation and reinforcement learning. \textsc{TestAgent} enables automatic dynamic benchmark generation and in-depth assessment across diverse vertical domains. Experiments on tasks ranging from constructing multiple vertical domain evaluations to transforming static benchmarks into dynamic forms demonstrate the effectiveness of \textsc{TestAgent}. This work provides a novel perspective on automatic evaluation methods for domain-specific LLMs, offering a pathway for domain-adaptive dynamic benchmark construction and exploratory assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active RLHF via Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of best policy identification in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning occurs from noisy binary preferences over trajectory pairs rather than explicit numerical rewards. This approach is useful for post-training optimization of generative AI models during multi-turn user interactions, where preference feedback is more robust than handcrafted reward models. In this setting, learning is driven by both an offline preference dataset -- collected from a rater of unknown `competence' -- and online data collected with pure exploration. Since offline datasets may exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) biases, principled online data collection is necessary. To address this, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling, that maintains independent posteriors over the true reward model and transition dynamics. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for PbRL in this setting, establishing an upper bound on the simple Bayesian regret of $\mathsf{PSPL}$. Since the exact algorithm can be computationally impractical, we also provide an approximate version that outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we focus on using LLM to generate an off-policy dataset that sufficiently covers state-actions visited by optimal policies, then later using an RL algorithm to explore the environment and improve the policy suggested by the LLM. Our algorithm, LORO, can both converge to an optimal policy and have a high sample efficiency thanks to the LLM's good starting policy. On multiple OpenAI Gym environments, such as CartPole and Pendulum, we empirically demonstrate that LORO outperforms baseline algorithms such as pure LLM-based policies, pure RL, and a naive combination of the two, achieving up to $4 \times$ the cumulative rewards of the pure RL baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages (9 for the main paper), 27 figures, NeurIPS 25 submission</p></details> |

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a promising solution, its application in practice is hindered by high trial-and-error costs in real world and unsatisfactory physical network performance during training. Also, existing DRL-based user association methods are typically applicable to scenarios with a fixed number of users due to convergence and compatibility challenges. To address these limitations, we introduce a large vision model (LVM)-enhanced digital twin (DT) for wireless networks and propose a parallel DT-driven DRL method for user association and load balancing in networks with dynamic user counts, distribution, and mobility patterns. To construct this LVM-enhanced DT for DRL training, we develop a zero-shot generative user mobility model, named Map2Traj, based on the diffusion model. Map2Traj estimates user trajectory patterns and spatial distributions solely from street maps. DRL models undergo training in the DT environment, avoiding direct interactions with physical networks. To enhance the generalization ability of DRL models for dynamic scenarios, a parallel DT framework is further established to alleviate strong correlation and non-stationarity in single-environment training and improve training efficiency. Numerical results show that the developed LVM-enhanced DT achieves closely comparable training efficacy to the real environment, and the proposed parallel DT framework even outperforms the single real-world environment in DRL training with nearly 20\% gain in terms of cell-edge user performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.19765.

| **[Online Bandit Learning with Offline Preference Data for Improved RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09574v4)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is at the core of fine-tuning methods for generative AI models for language and images. Such feedback is often sought as rank or preference feedback from human raters, as opposed to eliciting scores since the latter tends to be noisy. On the other hand, RL theory and algorithms predominantly assume that a reward feedback is available. In particular, approaches for online learning that can be helpful in adaptive data collection via active learning cannot incorporate offline preference data. In this paper, we adopt a finite-armed linear bandit model as a prototypical model of online learning. We consider an offline preference dataset to be available generated by an expert of unknown 'competence'. We propose warmPref-PS, a posterior sampling algorithm for online learning that can be warm-started with an offline dataset with noisy preference feedback. We show that by modeling the 'competence' of the expert that generated it, we are able to use such a dataset most effectively. We support our claims with novel theoretical analysis of its Bayesian regret, as well as, extensive empirical evaluation of an approximate loss function that optimizes for infinitely many arms, and performs substantially better than baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning When to Think: Shaping Adaptive Reasoning in R1-Style Models via Multi-Stage RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10832v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) are proficient at generating explicit, step-by-step reasoning sequences before producing final answers. However, such detailed reasoning can introduce substantial computational overhead and latency, particularly for simple problems. To address this over-thinking problem, we explore how to equip LRMs with adaptive thinking capabilities: enabling them to dynamically decide whether or not to engage in explicit reasoning based on problem complexity. Building on R1-style distilled models, we observe that inserting a simple ellipsis ("...") into the prompt can stochastically trigger either a thinking or no-thinking mode, revealing a latent controllability in the reasoning behavior. Leveraging this property, we propose AutoThink, a multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) framework that progressively optimizes reasoning policies via stage-wise reward shaping. AutoThink learns to invoke explicit reasoning only when necessary, while defaulting to succinct responses for simpler tasks. Experiments on five mainstream mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoThink achieves favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to recent prompting and RL-based pruning methods. It can be seamlessly integrated into any R1-style model, including both distilled and further fine-tuned variants. Notably, AutoThink improves relative accuracy by 6.4 percent while reducing token usage by 52 percent on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, establishing a scalable and adaptive reasoning paradigm for LRMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/TU2021/AutoThink</p></details> |

Reinforcement learning (RL), in particular, has outperformed traditional methods in optimizing yields and resource management. However, widespread AI adoption is limited by gaps between algorithmic recommendations and farmers' practical experience, local knowledge, and traditional practices. To address this, our study emphasizes Human-AI Interaction (HAII), focusing on transparency, usability, and trust in RL-based farm management. We employ a well-established trust framework - comprising ability, benevolence, and integrity - to develop a novel mathematical model quantifying farmers' confidence in AI-based fertilization strategies. Surveys conducted with farmers for this research reveal critical misalignments, which are integrated into our trust model and incorporated into a multi-objective RL framework. Unlike prior methods, our approach embeds trust directly into policy optimization, ensuring AI recommendations are technically robust, economically feasible, context-aware, and socially acceptable. By aligning technical performance with human-centered trust, this research supports broader AI adoption in agriculture.</p></details> |  |

A crucial but often under-explored component of these systems is the reranker. Since irrelevant documents in RAG systems can mislead the generator, the reranker plays a vital role in refining retrieved documents to enhance generation quality and explainability. However, it is challenging to determine the appropriate number of documents ($k$) that the reranker should select: too few may result in missing critical information, while too many introduce noise and inefficiencies. Although recent studies have explored LLM-based rerankers, they primarily leverage internal model knowledge and overlook the rich supervisory signals that LLMs can provide, such as using response quality as feedback for optimizing reranking decisions. In this paper, we propose DynamicRAG, a novel RAG framework where the reranker dynamically adjusts both the order and number of retrieved documents based on the query. We model the reranker as an agent optimized through reinforcement learning (RL), using rewards derived from LLM output quality. Across seven knowledge-intensive datasets, DynamicRAG demonstrates superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results among models of same parameter sizes.

In this work, we propose Attention-based REward Shaping (ARES), a general and robust algorithm which uses a transformer's attention mechanism to generate shaped rewards and create a dense reward function for any environment. ARES requires a set of episodes and their final returns as input. It can be trained entirely offline and is able to generate meaningful shaped rewards even when using small datasets or episodes produced by agents taking random actions. ARES is compatible with any RL algorithm and can handle any level of reward sparsity. In our experiments, we focus on the most challenging case where rewards are fully delayed until the end of each episode. We evaluate ARES across a diverse range of environments, widely used RL algorithms, and baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of the shaped rewards it produces. Our results show that ARES can significantly improve learning in delayed reward settings, enabling RL agents to train in scenarios that would otherwise require impractical amounts of data or even be unlearnable. To our knowledge, ARES is the first approach that works fully offline, remains robust to extreme reward delays and low-quality data, and is not limited to goal-based tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 17 tables, 2 figures.

A standard framework is to use off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods to evaluate and select the policies, but OPE either incurs exponential variance (e.g., importance sampling) or has hyperparameters on their own (e.g., FQE and model-based). In this work we focus on hyperparameter tuning for OPE itself, which is even more under-investigated. Concretely, we select among candidate value functions ("model-free") or dynamics ("model-based") to best assess the performance of a target policy. We develop: (1) new model-free and model-based selectors with theoretical guarantees, and (2) a new experimental protocol for empirically evaluating them. Compared to the model-free protocol in prior works, our new protocol allows for more stable generation and better control of candidate value functions in an optimization-free manner, and evaluation of model-free and model-based methods alike. We exemplify the protocol on Gym-Hopper, and find that our new model-free selector, LSTD-Tournament, demonstrates promising empirical performance.</p></details> |  |

Our results show that the performance can be improved by up to 14% compared to the most common (i.e., default) choice. Moreover, we showcase the strong statistical relation between some existing benchmarks and downstream performances. We also demonstrate that the results from a small set of benchmarks could be combined to boost the model selection ($+$18% on average in the top 5-10). Lastly, we illustrate the impact of different post-training steps on the final performance and explore using estimated data distributions to reduce performance prediction error.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, GRPO typically relies on solution-level and scalar reward signals that fail to capture the semantic diversity among sampled completions. This leads to what we identify as a diversity-quality inconsistency, where distinct reasoning paths may receive indistinguishable rewards. To address this limitation, we propose $\textit{Diversity-aware Reward Adjustment}$ (DRA), a method that explicitly incorporates semantic diversity into the reward computation. DRA uses Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) to downweight redundant completions and amplify rewards for diverse ones. This encourages better exploration during learning, while maintaining stable exploitation of high-quality samples. Our method integrates seamlessly with both GRPO and its variant DR.~GRPO, resulting in $\textit{DRA-GRPO}$ and $\textit{DGA-DR.~GRPO}$. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks and find that it outperforms recent strong baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 58.2%, using only 7,000 fine-tuning samples and a total training cost of approximately $55.

One notable example is equation discovery, which aims to automatically derive mathematical models expressed in symbolic form. In DSO, the discovery process is formulated as a sequential decision-making task. A generative neural network learns a probabilistic model over a vast space of candidate symbolic expressions, while reinforcement learning strategies guide the search toward the most promising regions. This approach integrates gradient-based optimization with evolutionary and local search techniques, and it incorporates in-situ constraints, domain-specific priors, and advanced policy optimization methods. The result is a robust framework capable of efficiently exploring extensive search spaces to identify interpretable and physically meaningful models.

These tools are composed of high-level utilities for use creating articulated assets in Blender, as well as an export pipeline to integrate the resulting assets into common robotics simulators. We demonstrate our system by creating procedural generators for 5 common articulated object categories. Experiments show that assets sampled from these generators are useful for movable object segmentation, training generalizable reinforcement learning policies, and sim-to-real transfer of imitation learning policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code-Driven Planning in Grid Worlds with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10749v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an iterative programmatic planning (IPP) framework for solving grid-based tasks by synthesizing interpretable agent policies expressed in code using large language models (LLMs). Instead of relying on traditional search or reinforcement learning, our approach uses code generation as policy synthesis, where the LLM outputs executable programs that map environment states to action sequences. Our proposed architecture incorporates several prompting strategies, including direct code generation, pseudocode-conditioned refinement, and curriculum-based prompting, but also includes an iterative refinement mechanism that updates code based on task performance feedback. We evaluate our approach using six leading LLMs and two challenging grid-based benchmarks (GRASP and MiniGrid). Our IPP framework demonstrates improvements over direct code generation ranging from 10\% to as much as 10x across five of the six models and establishes a new state-of-the-art result for GRASP. IPP is found to significantly outperform direct elicitation of a solution from GPT-o3-mini (by 63\% on MiniGrid to 116\% on GRASP), demonstrating the viability of the overall approach. Computational costs of all code generation approaches are similar. While code generation has a higher initial prompting cost compared to direct solution elicitation (\$0.08 per task vs. \$0.002 per instance for GPT-o3-mini), the code can be reused for any number of instances, making the amortized cost significantly lower (by 400x on GPT-o3-mini across the complete GRASP benchmark).</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Automated Resilient Cyber Defence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17585v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-attacks pose a security threat to military command and control networks, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, and civilian critical national infrastructure. The use of artificial intelligence and autonomous agents in these attacks increases the scale, range, and complexity of this threat and the subsequent disruption they cause. Autonomous Cyber Defence (ACD) agents aim to mitigate this threat by responding at machine speed and at the scale required to address the problem. Sequential decision-making algorithms such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) provide a promising route to create ACD agents. These algorithms focus on a single objective such as minimizing the intrusion of red agents on the network, by using a handcrafted weighted sum of rewards. This approach removes the ability to adapt the model during inference, and fails to address the many competing objectives present when operating and protecting these networks. Conflicting objectives, such as restoring a machine from a back-up image, must be carefully balanced with the cost of associated down-time, or the disruption to network traffic or services that might result. Instead of pursing a Single-Objective RL (SORL) approach, here we present a simple example of a multi-objective network defence game that requires consideration of both defending the network against red-agents and maintaining critical functionality of green-agents. Two Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms, namely Multi-Objective Proximal Policy Optimization (MOPPO), and Pareto-Conditioned Networks (PCN), are used to create two trained ACD agents whose performance is compared on our Multi-Objective Cyber Defence game. The benefits and limitations of MORL ACD agents in comparison to SORL ACD agents are discussed based on the investigations of this game.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Beyond 'Aha!': Toward Systematic Meta-Abilities Alignment in Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10554v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) already possess a latent capacity for long chain-of-thought reasoning. Prior work has shown that outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) can incidentally elicit advanced reasoning behaviors such as self-correction, backtracking, and verification phenomena often referred to as the model's "aha moment". However, the timing and consistency of these emergent behaviors remain unpredictable and uncontrollable, limiting the scalability and reliability of LRMs' reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we move beyond reliance on prompts and coincidental "aha moments". Instead, we explicitly align models with three meta-abilities: deduction, induction, and abduction, using automatically generated, self-verifiable tasks. Our three stage-pipeline individual alignment, parameter-space merging, and domain-specific reinforcement learning, boosting performance by over 10\% relative to instruction-tuned baselines. Furthermore, domain-specific RL from the aligned checkpoint yields an additional 2\% average gain in the performance ceiling across math, coding, and science benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit meta-ability alignment offers a scalable and dependable foundation for reasoning.

| **[Knowledge capture, adaptation and composition (KCAC): A framework for cross-task curriculum learning in robotic manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10522v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic manipulation but faces challenges in sample inefficiency and lack of interpretability, limiting its applicability in real world scenarios. Enabling the agent to gain a deeper understanding and adapt more efficiently to diverse working scenarios is crucial, and strategic knowledge utilization is a key factor in this process. This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation, and Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer into RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two block stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic manipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to solve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In this work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid constraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards concurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two self-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to facilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40 percent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10 percent compared to traditional RL methods. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key curriculum design parameters subtask selection, transition timing, and learning rate that optimize learning efficiency and provide conceptual guidance for curriculum based RL frameworks. This work offers valuable insights into curriculum design in RL and robotic learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fixing Incomplete Value Function Decomposition for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10484v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Value function decomposition methods for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning compose joint values from individual per-agent utilities, and train them using a joint objective. To ensure that the action selection process between individual utilities and joint values remains consistent, it is imperative for the composition to satisfy the individual-global max (IGM) property. Although satisfying IGM itself is straightforward, most existing methods (e.g., VDN, QMIX) have limited representation capabilities and are unable to represent the full class of IGM values, and the one exception that has no such limitation (QPLEX) is unnecessarily complex. In this work, we present a simple formulation of the full class of IGM values that naturally leads to the derivation of QFIX, a novel family of value function decomposition models that expand the representation capabilities of prior models by means of a thin "fixing" layer. We derive multiple variants of QFIX, and implement three variants in two well-known multi-agent frameworks. We perform an empirical evaluation on multiple SMACv2 and Overcooked environments, which confirms that QFIX (i) succeeds in enhancing the performance of prior methods, (ii) learns more stably and performs better than its main competitor QPLEX, and (iii) achieves this while employing the simplest and smallest mixing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-tuning Diffusion Policies with Backpropagation Through Diffusion Timesteps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10482v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcing the Diffusion Chain of Lateral Thought with Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10446v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the \emph{Diffusion Chain of Lateral Thought (DCoLT)}, a reasoning framework for diffusion language models. DCoLT treats each intermediate step in the reverse diffusion process as a latent "thinking" action and optimizes the entire reasoning trajectory to maximize the reward on the correctness of the final answer with outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods that follow a causal, linear thinking process, DCoLT allows bidirectional, non-linear reasoning with no strict rule on grammatical correctness amid its intermediate steps of thought. We implement DCoLT on two representative Diffusion Language Models (DLMs). First, we choose SEDD as a representative continuous-time discrete diffusion model, where its concrete score derives a probabilistic policy to maximize the RL reward over the entire sequence of intermediate diffusion steps. We further consider the discrete-time masked diffusion language model -- LLaDA, and find that the order to predict and unmask tokens plays an essential role to optimize its RL action resulting from the ranking-based Unmasking Policy Module (UPM) defined by the Plackett-Luce model. Experiments on both math and code generation tasks show that using only public data and 16 H800 GPUs, DCoLT-reinforced DLMs outperform other DLMs trained by SFT or RL or even both. Notably, DCoLT-reinforced LLaDA boosts its reasoning accuracy by +9.8%, +5.7%, +11.4%, +19.5% on GSM8K, MATH, MBPP, and HumanEval.</p></details> |  |
| **[IN-RIL: Interleaved Reinforcement and Imitation Learning for Policy Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10442v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) each offer distinct advantages for robotics policy learning: IL provides stable learning from demonstrations, and RL promotes generalization through exploration. While existing robot learning approaches using IL-based pre-training followed by RL-based fine-tuning are promising, this two-step learning paradigm often suffers from instability and poor sample efficiency during the RL fine-tuning phase. In this work, we introduce IN-RIL, INterleaved Reinforcement learning and Imitation Learning, for policy fine-tuning, which periodically injects IL updates after multiple RL updates and hence can benefit from the stability of IL and the guidance of expert data for more efficient exploration throughout the entire fine-tuning process. Since IL and RL involve different optimization objectives, we develop gradient separation mechanisms to prevent destructive interference during \ABBR fine-tuning, by separating possibly conflicting gradient updates in orthogonal subspaces. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous analysis, and our findings shed light on why interleaving IL with RL stabilizes learning and improves sample-efficiency. Extensive experiments on 14 robot manipulation and locomotion tasks across 3 benchmarks, including FurnitureBench, OpenAI Gym, and Robomimic, demonstrate that \ABBR can significantly improve sample efficiency and mitigate performance collapse during online finetuning in both long- and short-horizon tasks with either sparse or dense rewards. IN-RIL, as a general plug-in compatible with various state-of-the-art RL algorithms, can significantly improve RL fine-tuning, e.g., from 12\% to 88\% with 6.3x improvement in the success rate on Robomimic Transport.

| **[Learning to Think: Information-Theoretic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10425v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks thanks to advances in reasoning abilities. However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between reasoning effectiveness and computational efficiency, often encouraging unnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we propose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement fine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning with fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as a hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense process reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in parameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We propose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and the Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly reduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T optimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each episode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning benchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different tasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, most modern neural networks rely on a single mechanism: gradient descent over an objective function. This raises the question: might human learners' relatively rapid learning from just tens of examples instead of tens of thousands in data-driven deep learning arise from our ability to use multiple specialized mechanisms of learning in combination? We investigate this question through an ablation analysis of inductive human learning simulations in online tutoring environments. Comparing reinforcement learning to a more data-efficient 3-mechanism symbolic rule induction approach, we find that decomposing learning into multiple distinct mechanisms significantly improves data efficiency, bringing it in line with human learning. Furthermore, we show that this decomposition has a greater impact on efficiency than the distinction between symbolic and subsymbolic learning alone. Efforts to align data-driven machine learning with human learning often overlook the stark difference in learning efficiency. Our findings suggest that integrating multiple specialized learning mechanisms may be key to bridging this gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CogSci 2025</p></details> |

Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) Q-learning, which introduces a relaxation factor to speed up convergence, addresses this issue but has two major limitations: In the tabular setting, the relaxation parameter depends on transition probability, making it not entirely model-free, and it suffers from overestimation bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a sample-based, model-free double SOR Q-learning algorithm. Theoretically and empirically, this algorithm is shown to be less biased than SOR Q-learning. Further, in the tabular setting, the convergence analysis under boundedness assumptions on iterates is discussed. The proposed algorithm is extended to large-scale problems using deep RL. Finally, the tabular version of the proposed algorithm is compared using roulette and grid world environments, while the deep RL version is tested on a maximization bias example and OpenAI Gym environments.</p></details> |  |

While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown an impressive ability to learn optimal policies in stationary environments, most methods are data intensive and assume a world that does not change between training and test time. As a result, conventional RL methods struggle to adapt when conditions change. This poses a fundamental challenge: how can RL agents efficiently adapt their behavior when encountering novel environmental changes during deployment without catastrophically forgetting useful prior knowledge? This dissertation demonstrates that efficient online adaptation requires two key capabilities: (1) prioritized exploration and sampling strategies that help identify and learn from relevant experiences, and (2) selective preservation of prior knowledge through structured representations that can be updated without disruption to reusable components.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD D...</summary><p>PhD Dissertation, 131 pages</p></details> |

In particular, the recent release of DeepSeek-R1 has generated widespread social impact and sparked enthusiasm in the research community for exploring the explicit reasoning paradigm of language models. However, the implementation details of the released models have not been fully open-sourced by DeepSeek, including DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and the distilled small models. As a result, many replication studies have emerged aiming to reproduce the strong performance achieved by DeepSeek-R1, reaching comparable performance through similar training procedures and fully open-source data resources. These works have investigated feasible strategies for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), focusing on data preparation and method design, yielding various valuable insights. In this report, we provide a summary of recent replication studies to inspire future research. We primarily focus on SFT and RLVR as two main directions, introducing the details for data construction, method design and training procedure of current replication studies. Moreover, we conclude key findings from the implementation details and experimental results reported by these studies, anticipating to inspire future research. We also discuss additional techniques of enhancing RLMs, highlighting the potential of expanding the application scope of these models, and discussing the challenges in development. By this survey, we aim to help researchers and developers of RLMs stay updated with the latest advancements, and seek to inspire new ideas to further enhance RLMs.</p></details> |  |

Improved judgment ability is enabled by stronger chain-of-thought reasoning, motivating the need to find the best recipes for training such models to think. In this work we introduce J1, a reinforcement learning approach to training such models. Our method converts both verifiable and non-verifiable prompts to judgment tasks with verifiable rewards that incentivize thinking and mitigate judgment bias. In particular, our approach outperforms all other existing 8B or 70B models when trained at those sizes, including models distilled from DeepSeek-R1. J1 also outperforms o1-mini, and even R1 on some benchmarks, despite training a smaller model. We provide analysis and ablations comparing Pairwise-J1 vs Pointwise-J1 models, offline vs online training recipes, reward strategies, seed prompts, and variations in thought length and content. We find that our models make better judgments by learning to outline evaluation criteria, comparing against self-generated reference answers, and re-evaluating the correctness of model responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 tables, 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Electric Bus Charging Scheduling with Uncertainties Using Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10296v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Electric Buses (EBs) represents a significant step toward sustainable development. By utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) systems, charging stations can autonomously determine charging schedules based on real-time data. However, optimizing EB charging schedules remains a critical challenge due to uncertainties in travel time, energy consumption, and fluctuating electricity prices. Moreover, to address real-world complexities, charging policies must make decisions efficiently across multiple time scales and remain scalable for large EB fleets. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) approach that reformulates the original Markov Decision Process (MDP) into two augmented MDPs. To solve these MDPs and enable multi-timescale decision-making, we introduce a novel HDRL algorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization Enhancement (DAC-MAPPO-E). Scalability challenges of the Double Actor-Critic (DAC) algorithm for large-scale EB fleets are addressed through enhancements at both decision levels. At the high level, we redesign the decentralized actor network and integrate an attention mechanism to extract relevant global state information for each EB, decreasing the size of neural networks. At the low level, the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is incorporated into the DAC framework, enabling decentralized and coordinated charging power decisions, reducing computational complexity and enhancing convergence speed. Extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of DAC-MAPPO-E in optimizing EB fleet charging schedules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Electric Bus Charging Schedules Relying on Real Data-Driven Targets Based on Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10262v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The charging scheduling problem of Electric Buses (EBs) is investigated based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is conceived, where the time horizon includes multiple charging and operating periods in a day, while each period is further divided into multiple time steps. To overcome the challenge of long-range multi-phase planning with sparse reward, we conceive Hierarchical DRL (HDRL) for decoupling the original MDP into a high-level Semi-MDP (SMDP) and multiple low-level MDPs. The Hierarchical Double Deep Q-Network (HDDQN)-Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm is proposed for simultaneously solving the decision problems arising at different temporal resolutions. As a result, the high-level agent learns an effective policy for prescribing the charging targets for every charging period, while the low-level agent learns an optimal policy for setting the charging power of every time step within a single charging period, with the aim of minimizing the charging costs while meeting the charging target. It is proved that the flat policy constructed by superimposing the optimal high-level policy and the optimal low-level policy performs as well as the optimal policy of the original MDP. Since jointly learning both levels of policies is challenging due to the non-stationarity of the high-level agent and the sampling inefficiency of the low-level agent, we divide the joint learning process into two phases and exploit our new HER algorithm to manipulate the experience replay buffers for both levels of agents. Numerical experiments are performed with the aid of real-world data to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

We highlight two key contributions: (a) Theoretically, for the first time, we prove that enhancing the policy robustness to irrelevant features leads to improved generalization performance. (b) Empirically, we demonstrate that mutual distillation between policies contributes to such robustness, enabling the spontaneous emergence of invariant representations over pixel inputs. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional view of distillation as merely a means of knowledge transfer, offering a novel perspective on the generalization in deep reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose RAIDEN-R1, a novel reinforcement learning framework that integrates Verifiable Role-Awareness Reward (VRAR). The method introduces both singular and multi-term mining strategies to generate quantifiable rewards by assessing role-specific keys. Additionally, we construct a high-quality, role-aware Chain-of-Thought dataset through multi-LLM collaboration, and implement experiments to enhance reasoning coherence. Experiments on the RAIDEN benchmark demonstrate RAIDEN-R1's superiority: our 14B-GRPO model achieves 88.04% and 88.65% accuracy on Script-Based Knowledge and Conversation Memory metrics, respectively, outperforming baseline models while maintaining robustness. Case analyses further reveal the model's enhanced ability to resolve conflicting contextual cues and sustain first-person narrative consistency. This work bridges the non-quantifiability gap in RPCA training and provides insights into role-aware reasoning patterns, advancing the development of RPCAs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Progress Driven Multi-Agent Curriculum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10016v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The number of agents can be an effective curriculum variable for controlling the difficulty of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks. Existing work typically uses manually defined curricula such as linear schemes. We identify two potential flaws while applying existing reward-based automatic curriculum learning methods in MARL: (1) The expected episode return used to measure task difficulty has high variance; (2) Credit assignment difficulty can be exacerbated in tasks where increasing the number of agents yields higher returns which is common in many MARL tasks. To address these issues, we propose to control the curriculum by using a TD-error based *learning progress* measure and by letting the curriculum proceed from an initial context distribution to the final task specific one. Since our approach maintains a distribution over the number of agents and measures learning progress rather than absolute performance, which often increases with the number of agents, we alleviate problem (2). Moreover, the learning progress measure naturally alleviates problem (1) by aggregating returns. In three challenging sparse-reward MARL benchmarks, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, when training reasoning models, these approaches are primarily applicable to specific domains such as mathematics and programming, which imposes fundamental constraints on the breadth and scalability of training data. In contrast, continual pretraining (CPT) offers the advantage of not requiring task-specific signals. Nevertheless, how to effectively synthesize training data for reasoning and how such data affect a wide range of domains remain largely unexplored. This study provides a detailed evaluation of Reasoning CPT, a form of CPT that uses synthetic data to reconstruct the hidden thought processes underlying texts, based on the premise that texts are the result of the author's thinking process. Specifically, we apply Reasoning CPT to Gemma2-9B using synthetic data with hidden thoughts derived from STEM and Law corpora, and compare it to standard CPT on the MMLU benchmark. Our analysis reveals that Reasoning CPT consistently improves performance across all evaluated domains. Notably, reasoning skills acquired in one domain transfer effectively to others; the performance gap with conventional methods widens as problem difficulty increases, with gains of up to 8 points on the most challenging problems. Furthermore, models trained with hidden thoughts learn to adjust the depth of their reasoning according to problem difficulty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning Based on Convex Scoring Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04553v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework under a broad class of risk objectives, characterized by convex scoring functions. This class covers many common risk measures, such as variance, Expected Shortfall, entropic Value-at-Risk, and mean-risk utility. To resolve the time-inconsistency issue, we consider an augmented state space and an auxiliary variable and recast the problem as a two-state optimization problem. We propose a customized Actor-Critic algorithm and establish some theoretical approximation guarantees. A key theoretical contribution is that our results do not require the Markov decision process to be continuous. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary variable sampling method inspired by the alternating minimization algorithm, which is convergent under certain conditions. We validate our approach in simulation experiments with a financial application in statistical arbitrage trading, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm.</p></details> | 35 pages |

However, the most effective way of guiding novice teachers to approach expert-level demonstrations quantitatively for specific teaching tasks remains an open question. To this end, this paper investigates the use of machine teaching (MT) to guide novice teachers to improve their teaching skills based on reinforcement learning from demonstration (RLfD). The paper reports an experiment in which novices receive MT-derived guidance to train their ability to teach a given motor skill with only 8 demonstrations and generalise this to previously unseen ones. Results indicate that the MT-guidance not only enhances robot learning performance by 89% on the training skill but also causes a 70% improvement in robot learning performance on skills not seen by subjects during training. These findings highlight the effectiveness of MT-guidance in upskilling human teaching behaviours, ultimately improving demonstration quality in RLfD.</p></details> | 6 pages |

In this paper, we evaluate the resilience of a DRL-based agent designed to capture floating waste under various perturbations. We train the agent using domain randomization and evaluate its performance in real-world field tests, assessing its ability to handle unexpected disturbances such as asymmetric drag and an off-center payload. We assess the agent's performance under these perturbations in both simulation and real-world experiments, quantifying performance degradation and benchmarking it against an MPC baseline. Results indicate that the DRL agent performs reliably despite significant disturbances. Along with the open-source release of our implementation, we provide insights into effective training strategies, real-world challenges, and practical considerations for deploying DRLbased ASV controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Field Robotics at ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Video-R1: Reinforcing Video Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21776v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first attempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for incentivizing video reasoning within multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-CoT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 37.1% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o. All code, models, and data are released in: https://github.com/tulerfeng/Video-R1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/tulerfeng/Video-R1</p></details> |

Existing deep learning methods have made progress but still face limitations in handling complex scenes and preserving image details. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based latent diffusion model (LDM) fine-tuning method for remote sensing image super-resolution. The method constructs a reinforcement learning environment with states, actions, and rewards, optimizing decision objectives through proximal policy optimization (PPO) during the reverse denoising process of the LDM model. Experiments on the RESISC45 dataset show significant improvements over the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, with PSNR increasing by 3-4dB, SSIM improving by 0.08-0.11, and LPIPS reducing by 0.06-0.10, particularly in structured and complex natural scenes. The results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in enhancing super-resolution quality and adaptability across scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 4th International Conference on Computing Innovation and Applied Physics (CONF-CIAP 2025), and will be published in EAI Community Research Series-CORE or Theoretical and Natural Science (TNS)</p></details> |
| **[APEX: Action Priors Enable Efficient Exploration for Skill Imitation on Articulated Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10022v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning by imitation provides an effective way for robots to develop well-regulated complex behaviors and directly benefit from natural demonstrations. State-of-the-art imitation learning (IL) approaches typically leverage Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP), which, despite their impressive results, suffer from two key limitations. They are prone to mode collapse, which often leads to overfitting to the simulation environment and thus increased sim-to-real gap, and they struggle to learn diverse behaviors effectively. To overcome these limitations, we introduce APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient eXploration): a simple yet versatile imitation learning framework that integrates demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL), maintaining high exploration while grounding behavior with expert-informed priors. We achieve this through a combination of decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is complemented by a multi-critic RL framework that effectively balances stylistic consistency with task performance. Our approach achieves sample-efficient imitation learning and enables the acquisition of diverse skills within a single policy. APEX generalizes to varying velocities and preserves reference-like styles across complex tasks such as navigating rough terrain and climbing stairs, utilizing only flat-terrain kinematic motion data as a prior. We validate our framework through extensive hardware experiments on the Unitree Go2 quadruped. There, APEX yields diverse and agile locomotion gaits, inherent gait transitions, and the highest reported speed for the platform to the best of our knowledge (peak velocity of ~3.3 m/s on hardware). Our results establish APEX as a compelling alternative to existing IL methods, offering better efficiency, adaptability, and real-world performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImagineBench: Evaluating Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Model Rollouts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10010v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is its dependence on extensive real-world interaction data to learn task-specific policies. While recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can mitigate this limitation by generating synthetic experience (noted as imaginary rollouts) for mastering novel tasks, progress in this emerging field is hindered due to the lack of a standard benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce ImagineBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms that leverage both real rollouts and LLM-imaginary rollouts. The key features of ImagineBench include: (1) datasets comprising environment-collected and LLM-imaginary rollouts; (2) diverse domains of environments covering locomotion, robotic manipulation, and navigation tasks; and (3) natural language task instructions with varying complexity levels to facilitate language-conditioned policy learning. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, we observe that simply applying existing offline RL algorithms leads to suboptimal performance on unseen tasks, achieving 35.44% success rate in hard tasks in contrast to 64.37% of method training on real rollouts for hard tasks. This result highlights the need for algorithm advancements to better leverage LLM-imaginary rollouts. Additionally, we identify key opportunities for future research: including better utilization of imaginary rollouts, fast online adaptation and continual learning, and extension to multi-modal tasks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/LAMDA-RL/ImagineBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample Complexity of Distributionally Robust Average-Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10007v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by practical applications where stable long-term performance is critical-such as robotics, operations research, and healthcare-we study the problem of distributionally robust (DR) average-reward reinforcement learning. We propose two algorithms that achieve near-optimal sample complexity. The first reduces the problem to a DR discounted Markov decision process (MDP), while the second, Anchored DR Average-Reward MDP, introduces an anchoring state to stabilize the controlled transition kernels within the uncertainty set. Assuming the nominal MDP is uniformly ergodic, we prove that both algorithms attain a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(|\mathbf{S}||\mathbf{A}| t_{\mathrm{mix}}^2\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ for estimating the optimal policy as well as the robust average reward under KL and $f_k$-divergence-based uncertainty sets, provided the uncertainty radius is sufficiently small. Here, $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathbf{S}|$ and $|\mathbf{A}|$ denote the sizes of the state and action spaces, and $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is the mixing time of the nominal MDP. This represents the first finite-sample convergence guarantee for DR average-reward reinforcement learning. We further validate the convergence rates of our algorithms through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards More Efficient, Robust, Instance-adaptive, and Generalizable Sequential Decision making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09192v4)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary goal of my Ph.D. study is to develop provably efficient and practical algorithms for data-driven sequential decision-making under uncertainty. My work focuses on reinforcement learning (RL), multi-armed bandits, and their applications, including recommendation systems, computer networks, video analytics, and large language models (LLMs). Sequential decision-making methods, such as bandits and RL, have demonstrated remarkable success - ranging from outperforming human players in complex games like Atari and Go to advancing robotics, recommendation systems, and fine-tuning LLMs. Despite these successes, many established algorithms rely on idealized models that can fail under model misspecifications or adversarial perturbations, particularly in settings where accurate prior knowledge of the underlying model class is unavailable or where malicious users operate within dynamic systems. These challenges are pervasive in real-world applications, where robust and adaptive solutions are critical. Furthermore, while worst-case guarantees provide theoretical reliability, they often fail to capture instance-dependent performance, which can lead to more efficient and practical solutions. Another key challenge lies in generalizing to new, unseen environments, a crucial requirement for deploying these methods in dynamic and unpredictable settings. To address these limitations, my research aims to develop more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable sequential decision-making algorithms for both reinforcement learning and bandits. Towards this end, I focus on developing more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable for both general reinforcement learning (RL) and bandits.</p></details> | Ph.D. Thesis |

In this work, we propose that sharing the approximated behavior metric-based state projection function is a promising way to enhance the performance of FRL and concurrently provides an effective protection of sensitive information. We introduce FedRAG, a FRL framework to learn a computationally practical projection function of states for each client and aggregating the parameters of projection functions at a central server. The FedRAG approach shares no sensitive task-specific information, yet provides information gain for each client. We conduct extensive experiments on the DeepMind Control Suite to demonstrate insightful results.</p></details> |  |
| **[RM-R1: Reward Modeling as Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02387v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through reinforcement learning (RL). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. To this end, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. RM-R1 features a chain-of-rubrics (CoR) mechanism -- self-generating sample-level chat rubrics or math/code solutions, and evaluating candidate responses against them. The training of M-R1 consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across three reward model benchmarks on average, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., INF-ORM-Llama3.1-70B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 4.9%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.</p></details> | 24 pages, 8 figures |

Specifically, NLRL innovatively redefines RL principles, including task objectives, policy, value function, Bellman equation, and policy iteration, into their language counterparts. With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), NLRL can be practically implemented to achieve RL-like policy and value improvement by either pure prompting or gradient-based training.

| **[Concise Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05185v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs), a major drawback of reasoning models is their enormous token usage, which increases computational cost, resource requirements, and response time. In this work, we revisit the core principles of reinforcement learning (RL) and, through mathematical analysis, demonstrate that the tendency to generate lengthy responses arises inherently from RL-based optimization during training. This finding questions the prevailing assumption that longer responses inherently improve reasoning accuracy. Instead, we uncover a natural correlation between conciseness and accuracy that has been largely overlooked. We show that introducing a secondary phase of RL training, using a very small set of problems, can significantly reduce chains of thought while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that, while GRPO shares some interesting properties of PPO, it suffers from collapse modes, which limit its reliability for concise reasoning. Finally, we validate our conclusions through extensive experimental results.</p></details> |  |

Some risk-averse strategies, e.g., the conditional value-at-risk principle, are incorporated in domain randomization or meta reinforcement learning to prioritize difficult tasks in optimization, which demand costly intensive evaluations. The efficiency issue prompts the development of robust active task sampling to train adaptive policies, where risk-predictive models are used to surrogate policy evaluation. This work characterizes the optimization pipeline of robust active task sampling as a Markov decision process, posits theoretical and practical insights, and constitutes robustness concepts in risk-averse scenarios. Importantly, we propose an easy-to-implement method, referred to as Posterior and Diversity Synergized Task Sampling (PDTS), to accommodate fast and robust sequential decision-making. Extensive experiments show that PDTS unlocks the potential of robust active task sampling, significantly improves the zero-shot and few-shot adaptation robustness in challenging tasks, and even accelerates the learning process under certain scenarios.

Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.

| **[Should Collaborative Robots be Transparent?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11753v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We often assume that robots which collaborate with humans should behave in ways that are transparent (e.g., legible, explainable). These transparent robots intentionally choose actions that convey their internal state to nearby humans: for instance, a transparent robot might exaggerate its trajectory to indicate its goal. But while transparent behavior seems beneficial for human-robot interaction, is it actually optimal? In this paper we consider collaborative settings where the human and robot have the same objective, and the human is uncertain about the robot's type (i.e., the robot's internal state). We extend a recursive combination of Bayesian Nash equilibrium and the Bellman equation to solve for optimal robot policies. Interestingly, we discover that it is not always optimal for collaborative robots to be transparent; instead, human and robot teams can sometimes achieve higher rewards when the robot is opaque. In contrast to transparent robots, opaque robots select actions that withhold information from the human. Our analysis suggests that opaque behavior becomes optimal when either (a) human-robot interactions have a short time horizon or (b) users are slow to learn from the robot's actions. We extend this theoretical analysis to user studies across 43 total participants in both online and in-person settings. We find that -- during short interactions -- users reach higher rewards when working with opaque partners, and subjectively rate opaque robots as about equal to transparent robots.

In this paper, we propose a unified framework for Robot-Assisted Drone Recovery on a Wavy Surface that addresses two major tasks: Firstly, accurate prediction of a moving drone's position under wave-induced disturbances using an Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF), and secondly, effective motion planning for a manipulator via Receding Horizon Control (RHC). Specifically, the ESKF predicts the drone's future position 0.5s ahead, while the manipulator plans a capture trajectory in real time, thus overcoming not only wave-induced base motions but also limited torque constraints. We provide a system design that comprises a manipulator subsystem and a UAV subsystem. On the UAV side, we detail how position control and suspended payload strategies are implemented. On the manipulator side, we show how an RHC scheme outperforms traditional low-level control algorithms. Simulation and real-world experiments - using wave-disturbed motion data - demonstrate that our approach achieves a high success rate - above 95% and outperforms conventional baseline methods by up to 10% in efficiency and 20% in precision. The results underscore the feasibility and robustness of our system, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and offers a practical solution for maritime drone operations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Radiance Fields for Robotic Teleoperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20194v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiance field methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have revolutionized graphics and novel view synthesis. Their ability to synthesize new viewpoints with photo-realistic quality, as well as capture complex volumetric and specular scenes, makes them an ideal visualization for robotic teleoperation setups. Direct camera teleoperation provides high-fidelity operation at the cost of maneuverability, while reconstruction-based approaches offer controllable scenes with lower fidelity. With this in mind, we propose replacing the traditional reconstruction-visualization components of the robotic teleoperation pipeline with online Radiance Fields, offering highly maneuverable scenes with photorealistic quality. As such, there are three main contributions to state of the art: (1) online training of Radiance Fields using live data from multiple cameras, (2) support for a variety of radiance methods including NeRF and 3DGS, (3) visualization suite for these methods including a virtual reality scene. To enable seamless integration with existing setups, these components were tested with multiple robots in multiple configurations and were displayed using traditional tools as well as the VR headset. The results across methods and robots were compared quantitatively to a baseline of mesh reconstruction, and a user study was conducted to compare the different visualization methods.

| **[Distilling Contact Planning for Fast Trajectory Optimization in Robot Air Hockey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03705v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot control through contact is challenging as it requires reasoning over long horizons and discontinuous system dynamics. Highly dynamic tasks such as Air Hockey additionally require agile behavior, making the corresponding optimal control problems intractable for planning in realtime. Learning-based approaches address this issue by shifting computationally expensive reasoning through contacts to an offline learning phase. However, learning low-level motor policies subject to kinematic and dynamic constraints can be challenging if operating in proximity to such constraints is desired. This paper explores the combination of distilling a stochastic optimal control policy for high-level contact planning and online model-predictive control for low-level constrained motion planning. Our system learns to balance shooting accuracy and resulting puck speed by leveraging bank shots and the robot's kinematic structure. We show that the proposed framework outperforms purely control-based and purely learning-based techniques in both simulated and real-world games of Robot Air Hockey.</p></details> | <details><summary>Robot...</summary><p>Robotics: Science and Systems 2025</p></details> |

Wheel odometry fused with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data is a widely used method for velocity estimation; however, it typically requires strong assumptions, such as non-slip steering, or complex vehicle dynamics models that do not hold under varying environmental conditions like slippery surfaces. We introduce an approach to velocity estimation that is decoupled from wheel-to-surface traction assumptions by leveraging planar kinematics in combination with optical flow from event cameras pointed perpendicularly at the ground. The asynchronous micro-second latency and high dynamic range of event cameras make them highly robust to motion blur, a common challenge in vision-based perception techniques for autonomous driving. The proposed method is evaluated through in-field experiments on a 1:10 scale autonomous racing platform and compared to precise motion capture data, demonstrating not only performance on par with the state-of-the-art Event-VIO method but also a 38.3 % improvement in lateral error. Qualitative experiments at highway speeds of up to 32 m/s further confirm the effectiveness of our approach, indicating significant potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

To facilitate research addressing these challenges, we introduce PARSEC, an object rearrangement benchmark for learning user organizational preferences from observed scene context to place objects in a partially arranged environment. PARSEC is built upon a novel dataset of 110K rearrangement examples crowdsourced from 72 users, featuring 93 object categories and 15 environments. We also propose ContextSortLM, an LLM-based rearrangement model that places objects in partially arranged environments by adapting to user preferences from prior and current scene context while accounting for multiple valid placements. We evaluate ContextSortLM and existing personalized rearrangement approaches on the PARSEC benchmark and complement these findings with a crowdsourced evaluation of 108 online raters ranking model predictions based on alignment with user preferences. Our results indicate that personalized rearrangement models leveraging multiple scene context sources perform better than models relying on a single context source. Moreover, ContextSortLM outperforms other models in placing objects to replicate the target user's arrangement and ranks among the top two in all three environment categories, as rated by online evaluators. Importantly, our evaluation highlights challenges associated with modeling environment semantics across different environment categories and provides recommendations for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ROMAN 2025</p></details> |

However, applying these principles to legged locomotion remains a challenge due to continuous dynamics and the need for real-time adaptation across diverse terrains and robot morphologies. In this work, we propose GROQLoco, a scalable, attention-based framework that learns a single generalist locomotion policy across multiple quadruped robots and terrains, relying solely on offline datasets. Our approach leverages expert demonstrations from two distinct locomotion behaviors - stair traversal (non-periodic gaits) and flat terrain traversal (periodic gaits) - collected across multiple quadruped robots, to train a generalist model that enables behavior fusion for both behaviors. Crucially, our framework operates directly on proprioceptive data from all robots without incorporating any robot-specific encodings. The policy is directly deployable on an Intel i7 nuc, producing low-latency control outputs without any test-time optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate strong zero-shot transfer across highly diverse quadruped robots and terrains, including hardware deployment on the Unitree Go1, a commercially available 12kg robot. Notably, we evaluate challenging cross-robot training setups where different locomotion skills are unevenly distributed across robots, yet observe successful transfer of both flat walking and stair traversal behaviors to all robots at test time. We also show preliminary walking on Stoch 5, a 70kg quadruped, on flat and outdoor terrains without requiring any fine tuning. These results highlight the potential for robust generalist locomotion across diverse robots and terrains.</p></details> | <details><summary>18pag...</summary><p>18pages, 16figures, 6tables</p></details> |

However, few studies explore the practical alignment of pHRI to industrial-grade performance. This paper introduces a versatile control framework designed to bridge this gap by incorporating the torque-based control modes: compliance control, null-space compliance, and dual compliance, all in static and dynamic scenarios. Thanks to our second-order Quadratic Programming (QP) formulation, strict kinematic and collision constraints are integrated into the system as safety features, and a weighted hierarchy guarantees singularity-robust task tracking performance. The framework is implemented on a Kinova Gen3 collaborative robot (cobot) equipped with a Bota force/torque sensor. A DualShock 4 game controller is attached to the robot's end-effector to demonstrate the framework's capabilities. This setup enables seamless dynamic switching between the modes, and real-time adjustments of parameters, such as transitioning between position and torque control or selecting a more robust custom-developed low-level torque controller over the default one. Built on the open-source robotic control software mc_rtc, our framework ensures reproducibility for both research and industrial deployment, this framework demonstrates a step toward industrial-grade performance and repeatability, showcasing its potential as a robust pHRI control system for industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demo ...</summary><p>Demo Paper submitted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS2025), accepted</p></details> |

In contrast, ReWiND starts from a small demonstration dataset to learn: (1) a data-efficient, language-conditioned reward function that labels the dataset with rewards, and (2) a language-conditioned policy pre-trained with offline RL using these rewards. Given an unseen task variation, ReWiND fine-tunes the pre-trained policy using the learned reward function, requiring minimal online interaction. We show that ReWiND's reward model generalizes effectively to unseen tasks, outperforming baselines by up to 2.4x in reward generalization and policy alignment metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that ReWiND enables sample-efficient adaptation to new tasks, beating baselines by 2x in simulation and improving real-world pretrained bimanual policies by 5x, taking a step towards scalable, real-world robot learning.

| **[Fast and Robust Localization for Humanoid Soccer Robot via Iterative Landmark Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11020v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate robot localization is essential for effective operation. Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) is commonly used with known maps but is computationally expensive due to landmark matching for each particle. Humanoid robots face additional challenges, including sensor noise from locomotion vibrations and a limited field of view (FOV) due to camera placement. This paper proposes a fast and robust localization method via iterative landmark matching (ILM) for humanoid robots. The iterative matching process improves the accuracy of the landmark association so that it does not need MCL to match landmarks to particles. Pose estimation with the outlier removal process enhances its robustness to measurement noise and faulty detections. Furthermore, an additional filter can be utilized to fuse inertial data from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and pose data from localization. We compared ILM with Iterative Closest Point (ICP), which shows that ILM method is more robust towards the error in the initial guess and easier to get a correct matching. We also compared ILM with the Augmented Monte Carlo Localization (aMCL), which shows that ILM method is much faster than aMCL and even more accurate. The proposed method's effectiveness is thoroughly evaluated through experiments and validated on the humanoid robot ARTEMIS during RoboCup 2024 adult-sized soccer competition.</p></details> |  |

This dataset, collected in various photorealistic simulation environments includes multiple RGB stereo cameras for 360-degree coverage, along with depth, optical flow, stereo disparity, LiDAR point clouds, ground truth poses, semantic segmented images, and occupancy maps with semantic labels. Data is collected using an integrated automatic pipeline, which generates trajectories mimicking the motion patterns of various ground robot platforms, including wheeled and legged robots. We collect 910 trajectories across 70 environments, resulting in 1.5 million samples. Evaluations on occupancy prediction and SLAM tasks reveal that state-of-the-art methods trained on existing datasets struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. TartanGround can serve as a testbed for training and evaluation of a broad range of learning-based tasks, including occupancy prediction, SLAM, neural scene representation, perception-based navigation, and more, enabling advancements in robotic perception and autonomy towards achieving robust models generalizable to more diverse scenarios.

| **[Modular Robot Control with Motor Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10694v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite a slow neuromuscular system, humans easily outperform modern robot technology, especially in physical contact tasks. How is this possible? Biological evidence indicates that motor control of biological systems is achieved by a modular organization of motor primitives, which are fundamental building blocks of motor behavior. Inspired by neuro-motor control research, the idea of using simpler building blocks has been successfully used in robotics. Nevertheless, a comprehensive formulation of modularity for robot control remains to be established. In this paper, we introduce a modular framework for robot control using motor primitives. We present two essential requirements to achieve modular robot control: independence of modules and closure of stability. We describe key control modules and demonstrate that a wide range of complex robotic behaviors can be generated from this small set of modules and their combinations. The presented modular control framework demonstrates several beneficial properties for robot control, including task-space control without solving Inverse Kinematics, addressing the problems of kinematic singularity and kinematic redundancy, and preserving passivity for contact and physical interactions. Further advantages include exploiting kinematic singularity to maintain high external load with low torque compensation, as well as controlling the robot beyond its end-effector, extending even to external objects. Both simulation and actual robot experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of our modular framework. We conclude that modularity may be an effective constructive framework for achieving robotic behaviors comparable to human-level performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 9 figures, Submitted to International Journal of Robotics Research for Review</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge capture, adaptation and composition (KCAC): A framework for cross-task curriculum learning in robotic manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10522v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic manipulation but faces challenges in sample inefficiency and lack of interpretability, limiting its applicability in real world scenarios. Enabling the agent to gain a deeper understanding and adapt more efficiently to diverse working scenarios is crucial, and strategic knowledge utilization is a key factor in this process. This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation, and Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer into RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two block stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic manipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to solve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In this work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid constraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards concurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two self-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to facilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40 percent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10 percent compared to traditional RL methods. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key curriculum design parameters subtask selection, transition timing, and learning rate that optimize learning efficiency and provide conceptual guidance for curriculum based RL frameworks. This work offers valuable insights into curriculum design in RL and robotic learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoCam: Hierarchical Path Planning for an Autonomous Auxiliary Camera in Surgical Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10398v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating an autonomous auxiliary camera into robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) enhances spatial awareness and eliminates manual viewpoint control. Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained 99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\pm$ 2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study (N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Existing methods combining sampling-based planners with trajectory optimization produce suboptimal results and lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Physically-coupled discontinuity-bounded Conflict-Based Search (pc-dbCBS), an anytime kinodynamic motion planner, that extends discontinuity-bounded CBS to rigidly-coupled systems. Our approach proposes a tri-level conflict detection and resolution framework that includes the physical coupling between the robots. Moreover, pc-dbCBS alternates iteratively between state space representations, thereby preserving probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality while relying only on single-robot motion primitives. Across 25 simulated and six real-world problems involving multirotors carrying a cable-suspended payload and differential-drive robots linked by rigid rods, pc-dbCBS solves up to 92% more instances than a state-of-the-art baseline and plans trajectories that are 50-60% faster while reducing planning time by an order of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Joint Robotic Aerial Base Station Deployment and Wireless Backhauling in 6G Multi-hop Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07714v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their ability to anchor into tall urban landforms, such as lampposts or street lights, robotic aerial base stations (RABSs) can create a hyper-flexible wireless multi-hop heterogeneous network to meet the forthcoming green, densified, and dynamic network deployment to support, inter alia, high data rates. In this work, we propose a network infrastructure that can concurrently support the wireless backhaul link capacity and access link traffic demand in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. The RABSs grasping locations, resource blocks (RBs) assignment, and route flow control are simultaneously optimized to maximize the served traffic demands. Robotic base stations capitalize on the fact that traffic distribution varies considerably across both time and space within a given geographical area. Hence, they are able to relocate to suitable locations, i.e., 'follow' the traffic demand as it unfolds to increase the overall network efficiency. To tackle the curse of dimensionality of the proposed mixed-integer linear problem, we propose a greedy algorithm to obtain a competitive solution with low computational complexity. Compared to baseline models, which are heterogeneous networks with randomly deployed fixed small cells and pre-allocated RBs for wireless access and backhaul links, a wide set of numerical investigations reveals that robotic base stations could improve the served traffic demand. Specifically, the proposed mode serves at most 65\% more traffic demand compared to an equal number of deployed fixed small cells.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version reflects the conference publication in 2025 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC), with a minor modified title and text content.

| **[Force-Driven Validation for Collaborative Robotics in Automated Avionics Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10224v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ARTO is a project combining collaborative robots (cobots) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate functional test procedures for civilian and military aircraft certification. This paper proposes a Deep Learning (DL) and eXplainable AI (XAI) approach, equipping ARTO with interaction analysis capabilities to verify and validate the operations on cockpit components. During these interactions, forces, torques, and end effector poses are recorded and preprocessed to filter disturbances caused by low performance force controllers and embedded Force Torque Sensors (FTS). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) then classify the cobot actions as Success or Fail, while also identifying and reporting the causes of failure. To improve interpretability, Grad CAM, an XAI technique for visual explanations, is integrated to provide insights into the models decision making process. This approach enhances the reliability and trustworthiness of the automated testing system, facilitating the diagnosis and rectification of errors that may arise during testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Safe Robot Foundation Models Using Inductive Biases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10219v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety is a critical requirement for the real-world deployment of robotic systems. Unfortunately, while current robot foundation models show promising generalization capabilities across a wide variety of tasks, they fail to address safety, an important aspect for ensuring long-term operation. Current robot foundation models assume that safe behavior should emerge by learning from a sufficiently large dataset of demonstrations. However, this approach has two clear major drawbacks. Firstly, there are no formal safety guarantees for a behavior cloning policy trained using supervised learning. Secondly, without explicit knowledge of any safety constraints, the policy may require an unreasonable number of additional demonstrations to even approximate the desired constrained behavior. To solve these key issues, we show how we can instead combine robot foundation models with geometric inductive biases using ATACOM, a safety layer placed after the foundation policy that ensures safe state transitions by enforcing action constraints. With this approach, we can ensure formal safety guarantees for generalist policies without providing extensive demonstrations of safe behavior, and without requiring any specific fine-tuning for safety. Our experiments show that our approach can be beneficial both for classical manipulation tasks, where we avoid unwanted collisions with irrelevant objects, and for dynamic tasks, such as the robot air hockey environment, where we can generate fast trajectories respecting complex tasks and joint space constraints.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Some robots have already been tested in general-purpose scenarios such as homes and shopping malls. We aim to advance the research and application of embodied intelligence in industrial scenes. However, current EIR lacks a deep understanding of industrial environment semantics and the normative constraints between industrial operating objects. To address this gap, this paper first reviews the history of industrial robotics and the mainstream EIR frameworks. We then introduce the concept of the embodied intelligent industrial robotics (EIIR) and propose a knowledge-driven EIIR technology framework for industrial environments. The framework includes four main modules: world model, high-level task planner, low-level skill controller, and simulator. We also review the current development of technologies related to each module and highlight recent progress in adapting them to industrial applications. Finally, we summarize the key challenges EIIR faces in industrial scenarios and suggest future research directions. We believe that EIIR technology will shape the next generation of industrial robotics. Industrial systems based on embodied intelligent industrial robots offer strong potential for enabling intelligent manufacturing. We will continue to track and summarize new research in this area and hope this review will serve as a valuable reference for scholars and engineers interested in industrial embodied intelligence. Together, we can help drive the rapid advancement and application of this technology.

A novel framework named LLM A*, aims to leverage the commonsense of LLMs, and the utility-optimal A* is proposed to facilitate few-shot near-optimal path planning. Prompts are used for two main purposes: 1) to provide LLMs with essential information like environments, costs, heuristics, etc.; 2) to communicate human feedback on intermediate planning results to LLMs. This approach takes human feedback on board and renders the entire planning process transparent (akin to a `white box') to humans. Moreover, it facilitates code-free path planning, thereby fostering the accessibility and inclusiveness of artificial intelligence techniques to communities less proficient in coding. Comparative analysis against A* and RL demonstrates that LLM A* exhibits greater efficiency in terms of search space and achieves paths comparable to A* while outperforming RL. The interactive nature of LLM A* also makes it a promising tool for deployment in collaborative human-robot tasks.

However, the most effective way of guiding novice teachers to approach expert-level demonstrations quantitatively for specific teaching tasks remains an open question. To this end, this paper investigates the use of machine teaching (MT) to guide novice teachers to improve their teaching skills based on reinforcement learning from demonstration (RLfD). The paper reports an experiment in which novices receive MT-derived guidance to train their ability to teach a given motor skill with only 8 demonstrations and generalise this to previously unseen ones. Results indicate that the MT-guidance not only enhances robot learning performance by 89% on the training skill but also causes a 70% improvement in robot learning performance on skills not seen by subjects during training. These findings highlight the effectiveness of MT-guidance in upskilling human teaching behaviours, ultimately improving demonstration quality in RLfD.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Current approaches suffer from significant domain gaps between training datasets and robot manipulation tasks, while also lacking model architectures that can effectively incorporate 3D information. To overcome these limitations, we enhance the DROID dataset with high-quality depth maps and point clouds, constructing DROID-3D as a valuable supplement for 3D embodied vision research. Then we develop EmbodiedMAE, a multi-modal masked autoencoder that simultaneously learns representations across RGB, depth, and point cloud modalities through stochastic masking and cross-modal fusion. Trained on DROID-3D, EmbodiedMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art vision foundation models (VFMs) in both training efficiency and final performance across 70 simulation tasks and 20 real-world robot manipulation tasks on two robot platforms. The model exhibits strong scaling behavior with size and promotes effective policy learning from 3D inputs. Experimental results establish EmbodiedMAE as a reliable unified 3D multi-modal VFM for embodied AI systems, particularly in precise tabletop manipulation settings where spatial perception is critical.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we consider world models that operate on RGB-D frames (RGB-D world models). As opposed to canonical approaches that handle dynamics prediction mostly implicitly and reconcile it with visual rendering in a single model, we introduce FlowDreamer, which adopts 3D scene flow as explicit motion representations. FlowDreamer first predicts 3D scene flow from past frame and action conditions with a U-Net, and then a diffusion model will predict the future frame utilizing the scene flow. FlowDreamer is trained end-to-end despite its modularized nature. We conduct experiments on 4 different benchmarks, covering both video prediction and visual planning tasks. The results demonstrate that FlowDreamer achieves better performance compared to other baseline RGB-D world models by 7% on semantic similarity, 11% on pixel quality, and 6% on success rate in various robot manipulation domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: see https://sharinka0715.github.io/FlowDreamer/</p></details> |

The spatial clustering we propose offers to simultaneously solve the task allocation problem and deal with collision risks by cutting the workspace into distinguishable operational zones for each robot. To divide task sites and to schedule robot routes within corresponding clusters, we use K-means clustering and the 2-Opt algorithm. The presented framework shows satisfactory performance, where up to 93\% time reduction (1.24s against 17.62s) with a solution quality improvement of up to 7\% compared to the best performing method is demonstrated. Our method also completely eliminates collision points that persist in comparative methods in a most significant sense. Theoretical analysis agrees with the claim that spatial partitioning unifies the apparently disjoint tasks allocation and collision avoidance problems under conditions of many identical tasks to be distributed over sparse geographical areas. Ultimately, the findings in this work are of substantial importance for real world applications where both computational efficiency and operation free from collisions is of paramount importance.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, Scheduled for presentation at an upcoming conference</p></details> |

The numerous applications of agricultural robots rely on the transmission of data via mobile network, with the amount of data depending on the services offered by the robots and the level of on-board technology. Nevertheless, infrastructure required to deploy these robots, as well as the related energy and environmental consequences, appear overlooked in the digital agriculture literature. In this study, we propose a method for assessing the additional energy consumption and carbon footprint induced by a large-scale deployment of agricultural robots. Our method also estimates the share of agricultural area that can be managed by the deployed robots with respect to network infrastructure constraints. We have applied this method to metropolitan France mobile network and agricultural parcels for five different robotic scenarios. Our results show that increasing the robot's bitrate needs leads to significant additional impacts, which increase at a pace that is poorly captured by classical linear extrapolation methods. When constraining the network to the existing sites, increased bitrate needs also comes with a rapidly decreasing manageable agricultural area.</p></details> |  |

Our method partitions the workspace, assigns fruit-picking sequences to arms, determines tight and feasible fruit-picking schedules and vehicle travel speed, and generates smooth, collision-free arm trajectories. The fruit-picking throughput achieved by the algorithm was assessed using synthetically generated fruit coordinates and a harvester design featuring up to 12 arms. The throughput increased monotonically as more arms were added. Adding more arms when fruit densities were low resulted in diminishing gains because it took longer to travel from one fruit to another. However, when there were enough fruits, the proposed algorithm achieved a linear speedup as the number of arms increased.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work will be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[APEX: Action Priors Enable Efficient Exploration for Skill Imitation on Articulated Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10022v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning by imitation provides an effective way for robots to develop well-regulated complex behaviors and directly benefit from natural demonstrations. State-of-the-art imitation learning (IL) approaches typically leverage Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP), which, despite their impressive results, suffer from two key limitations. They are prone to mode collapse, which often leads to overfitting to the simulation environment and thus increased sim-to-real gap, and they struggle to learn diverse behaviors effectively. To overcome these limitations, we introduce APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient eXploration): a simple yet versatile imitation learning framework that integrates demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL), maintaining high exploration while grounding behavior with expert-informed priors. We achieve this through a combination of decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is complemented by a multi-critic RL framework that effectively balances stylistic consistency with task performance. Our approach achieves sample-efficient imitation learning and enables the acquisition of diverse skills within a single policy. APEX generalizes to varying velocities and preserves reference-like styles across complex tasks such as navigating rough terrain and climbing stairs, utilizing only flat-terrain kinematic motion data as a prior. We validate our framework through extensive hardware experiments on the Unitree Go2 quadruped. There, APEX yields diverse and agile locomotion gaits, inherent gait transitions, and the highest reported speed for the platform to the best of our knowledge (peak velocity of ~3.3 m/s on hardware). Our results establish APEX as a compelling alternative to existing IL methods, offering better efficiency, adaptability, and real-world performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Diverse Natural Behaviors for Enhancing the Agility of Quadrupedal Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09979v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving animal-like agility is a longstanding goal in quadrupedal robotics. While recent studies have successfully demonstrated imitation of specific behaviors, enabling robots to replicate a broader range of natural behaviors in real-world environments remains an open challenge. Here we propose an integrated controller comprising a Basic Behavior Controller (BBC) and a Task-Specific Controller (TSC) which can effectively learn diverse natural quadrupedal behaviors in an enhanced simulator and efficiently transfer them to the real world. Specifically, the BBC is trained using a novel semi-supervised generative adversarial imitation learning algorithm to extract diverse behavioral styles from raw motion capture data of real dogs, enabling smooth behavior transitions by adjusting discrete and continuous latent variable inputs. The TSC, trained via privileged learning with depth images as input, coordinates the BBC to efficiently perform various tasks. Additionally, we employ evolutionary adversarial simulator identification to optimize the simulator, aligning it closely with reality. After training, the robot exhibits diverse natural behaviors, successfully completing the quadrupedal agility challenge at an average speed of 1.1 m/s and achieving a peak speed of 3.2 m/s during hurdling. This work represents a substantial step toward animal-like agility in quadrupedal robots, opening avenues for their deployment in increasingly complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

However, the reliance on traditional 2D displays imposes limitations on the simultaneous visualization of information. Mixed Reality (MR) technology addresses this issue by enhancing the dimensionality of information visualization, allowing users to perceive multiple pieces of information concurrently. This paper proposes the Mixed Reality-based Robot Navigation Interface using an Optical-see-through MR-beacons (MRNaB), a novel approach that uses MR-beacons created with an ``air tap'', situated in the real world. This beacon is persistent, enabling multi-destination visualization and functioning as a signal transmitter for robot navigation, eliminating the need for repeated navigation inputs. Our system is mainly constructed into four primary functions: ``Add'', ``Move'', ``Delete'', and ``Select''. These allow for the addition of MR-beacons, location movement, its deletion, and the selection of MR-beacons for navigation purposes, respectively. To validate the effectiveness, we conducted comprehensive experiments comparing MRNaB with traditional 2D navigation systems. The results show significant improvements in user performance, both objectively and subjectively, confirming that the MRNaB enhances navigation efficiency and user experience.

We present a geometric and mechanical framework for Yoshimura-Ori modules that supports a diverse set of metastable states, including newly identified asymmetric "pop-out" and "hyperfolded" configurations. These states are governed by three parameters -- tilt angle, phase shift, and slant height -- and enable discrete, programmable transformations. Using this model, we develop forward and inverse kinematic strategies to stack modules into deployable booms that approximate complex 3D shapes. We validate our approach through mechanical tests and demonstrate a tendon- and pneumatically-actuated Yoshimura Space Crane capable of object manipulation, solar tracking, and high load-bearing performance. A meter-scale solar charging station further illustrates the design's scalability. These results establish Yoshimura-Ori structures as a promising platform for adaptable, multifunctional deployable systems in both terrestrial and space environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-SAFE: Shared Autonomy Framework with Diffusion for Safe Human-to-Robot Driving Handover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09889v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe handover in shared autonomy for vehicle control is well-established in modern vehicles. However, avoiding accidents often requires action several seconds in advance. This necessitates understanding human driver behavior and an expert control strategy for seamless intervention when a collision or unsafe state is predicted. We propose Diffusion-SAFE, a closed-loop shared autonomy framework leveraging diffusion models to: (1) predict human driving behavior for detection of potential risks, (2) generate safe expert trajectories, and (3) enable smooth handovers by blending human and expert policies over a short time horizon. Unlike prior works which use engineered score functions to rate driving performance, our approach enables both performance evaluation and optimal action sequence generation from demonstrations. By adjusting the forward and reverse processes of the diffusion-based copilot, our method ensures a gradual transition of control authority, by mimicking the drivers' behavior before intervention, which mitigates abrupt takeovers, leading to smooth transitions. We evaluated Diffusion-SAFE in both simulation (CarRacing-v0) and real-world (ROS-based race car), measuring human-driving similarity, safety, and computational efficiency. Results demonstrate a 98.5\% successful handover rate, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in progressively correcting human actions and continuously sampling optimal robot actions.</p></details> |  |

However, they often fail to capture the level of detail required for inspection and scene awareness tasks. Conversely, dense SLAM approaches generate richer scene reconstructions but impose a prohibitive computational load to create 3D maps. We present a novel distributed volumetric mapping framework designated as CRADMap that addresses these issues by extending the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ORBSLAM3 system with the COVINS on the backend for global optimization. Our pipeline for volumetric reconstruction fuses dense keyframes at a centralized server via 5G connectivity, aggregating geometry, and occupancy information from multiple autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) without overtaxing onboard resources. This enables each AMR to independently perform mapping while the backend constructs high-fidelity real-time 3D maps. To operate Beyond the Visible (BtV) and overcome the limitations of standard visual sensors, we automated a standalone 4D mmWave radar module that functions independently without sensor fusion with SLAM. The BtV system enables the detection and mapping of occluded metallic objects in cluttered environments, enhancing situational awareness in inspection scenarios. Experimental validation in Section~\ref{sec:IV} demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, IEEE, ICARM</p></details> |
| **[Neural Associative Skill Memories for safer robotics and modelling human sensorimotor repertoires](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09760v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern robots face challenges shared by humans, where machines must learn multiple sensorimotor skills and express them adaptively. Equipping robots with a human-like memory of how it feels to do multiple stereotypical movements can make robots more aware of normal operational states and help develop self-preserving safer robots. Associative Skill Memories (ASMs) aim to address this by linking movement primitives to sensory feedback, but existing implementations rely on hard-coded libraries of individual skills. A key unresolved problem is how a single neural network can learn a repertoire of skills while enabling fault detection and context-aware execution. Here we introduce Neural Associative Skill Memories (ASMs), a framework that utilises self-supervised predictive coding for temporal prediction to unify skill learning and expression, using biologically plausible learning rules. Unlike traditional ASMs which require explicit skill selection, Neural ASMs implicitly recognize and express skills through contextual inference, enabling fault detection across learned behaviours without an explicit skill selection mechanism. Compared to recurrent neural networks trained via backpropagation through time, our model achieves comparable qualitative performance in skill memory expression while using local learning rules and predicts a biologically relevant speed-accuracy trade-off during skill memory expression. This work advances the field of neurorobotics by demonstrating how predictive coding principles can model adaptive robot control and human motor preparation. By unifying fault detection, reactive control, skill memorisation and expression into a single energy-based architecture, Neural ASMs contribute to safer robotics and provide a computational lens to study biological sensorimotor learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[On-Robot Reinforcement Learning with Goal-Contrastive Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19989v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to enable robots to learn from their own actions in the real world. Unfortunately, RL can be prohibitively expensive, in terms of on-robot runtime, due to inefficient exploration when learning from a sparse reward signal. Designing dense reward functions is labour-intensive and requires domain expertise. In our work, we propose GCR (Goal-Contrastive Rewards), a dense reward function learning method that can be trained on passive video demonstrations. By using videos without actions, our method is easier to scale, as we can use arbitrary videos. GCR combines two loss functions, an implicit value loss function that models how the reward increases when traversing a successful trajectory, and a goal-contrastive loss that discriminates between successful and failed trajectories. We perform experiments in simulated manipulation environments across RoboMimic and MimicGen tasks, as well as in the real world using a Franka arm and a Spot quadruped. We find that GCR leads to a more-sample efficient RL, enabling model-free RL to solve about twice as many tasks as our baseline reward learning methods. We also demonstrate positive cross-embodiment transfer from videos of people and of other robots performing a task. Website: https://gcr-robot.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

In robotic manipulation, VLMs are used primarily as high-level planners, but recent work has also studied their lower-level reasoning ability, which refers to making decisions about precise robot movements. However, the community currently lacks a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench, to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation reasoning capabilities of VLMs across various dimensions, including how well they understand object-object interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively test 33 representative VLMs across 10 model families on our benchmark, including variants to test different model sizes. Our evaluation shows that the performance of VLMs significantly varies across tasks, and there is a strong correlation between this performance and trends in our real-world manipulation tasks. It also shows that there remains a significant gap between these models and human-level understanding.

| **[DataMIL: Selecting Data for Robot Imitation Learning with Datamodels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09603v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the robotics community has amassed ever larger and more diverse datasets to train generalist robot policies. However, while these policies achieve strong mean performance across a variety of tasks, they often underperform on individual, specialized tasks and require further tuning on newly acquired task-specific data. Combining task-specific data with carefully curated subsets of large prior datasets via co-training can produce better specialized policies, but selecting data naively may actually harm downstream performance. To address this, we introduce DataMIL, a policy-driven data selection framework built on the datamodels paradigm that reasons about data selection in an end-to-end manner, using the policy itself to identify which data points will most improve performance. Unlike standard practices that filter data using human notions of quality (e.g., based on semantic or visual similarity), DataMIL directly optimizes data selection for task success, allowing us to select data that enhance the policy while dropping data that degrade it. To avoid performing expensive rollouts in the environment during selection, we use a novel surrogate loss function on task-specific data, allowing us to use DataMIL in the real world without degrading performance. We validate our approach on a suite of more than 60 simulation and real-world manipulation tasks - most notably showing successful data selection from the Open X-Embodiment datasets-demonstrating consistent gains in success rates and superior performance over multiple baselines. Our results underscore the importance of end-to-end, performance-aware data selection for unlocking the potential of large prior datasets in robotics.

Yet the prevailing data collection paradigm-human teleoperation-remains costly and constrained by manual effort and physical robot access. We introduce Real2Render2Real (R2R2R), a novel approach for generating robot training data without relying on object dynamics simulation or teleoperation of robot hardware. The input is a smartphone-captured scan of one or more objects and a single video of a human demonstration. R2R2R renders thousands of high visual fidelity robot-agnostic demonstrations by reconstructing detailed 3D object geometry and appearance, and tracking 6-DoF object motion. R2R2R uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable flexible asset generation and trajectory synthesis for both rigid and articulated objects, converting these representations to meshes to maintain compatibility with scalable rendering engines like IsaacLab but with collision modeling off. Robot demonstration data generated by R2R2R integrates directly with models that operate on robot proprioceptive states and image observations, such as vision-language-action models (VLA) and imitation learning policies. Physical experiments suggest that models trained on R2R2R data from a single human demonstration can match the performance of models trained on 150 human teleoperation demonstrations.

In this paper, we introduce a novel formation control system for an indoor blimp swarm using a specialized leader-follower approach enhanced with a dynamic leader-switching mechanism. This strategy allows any blimp to take on the leader role, distributing maneuvering demands across the swarm and enhancing overall formation stability. Only the leader blimp is manually controlled by a human operator, while follower blimps use onboard monocular cameras and a laser altimeter for relative position and altitude estimation. A leader-switching scheme is proposed to assist the human operator to maintain stability of the swarm, especially when a sharp turn is performed. Experimental results confirm that the leader-switching mechanism effectively maintains stable formations and adapts to dynamic indoor environments while assisting human operator.</p></details> |  |

However, existing FM-enabled robots primary operate in closed-world settings, where the robot is given a full prior map or has a full view of its workspace. This paper addresses the deployment of FM-enabled robots in the field, where missions often require a robot to operate in large-scale and unstructured environments. To effectively accomplish these missions, robots must actively explore their environments, navigate obstacle-cluttered terrain, handle unexpected sensor inputs, and operate with compute constraints. We discuss recent deployments of SPINE, our LLM-enabled autonomy framework, in field robotic settings. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first demonstration of large-scale LLM-enabled robot planning in unstructured environments with several kilometers of missions. SPINE is agnostic to a particular LLM, which allows us to distill small language models capable of running onboard size, weight and power (SWaP) limited platforms. Via preliminary model distillation work, we then present the first language-driven UAV planner using on-device language models. We conclude our paper by proposing several promising directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics 2025</p></details> |

In domains from NLP to Computer Vision, this has led to a consolidation of pretrained models, with general pretrained backbones serving as a starting point for many applications. Can such a consolidation happen in robotics? Conventionally, robotic learning methods train a separate model for every application, every robot, and even every environment. Can we instead train generalist X-robot policy that can be adapted efficiently to new robots, tasks, and environments? In this paper, we provide datasets in standardized data formats and models to make it possible to explore this possibility in the context of robotic manipulation, alongside experimental results that provide an example of effective X-robot policies. We assemble a dataset from 22 different robots collected through a collaboration between 21 institutions, demonstrating 527 skills (160266 tasks). We show that a high-capacity model trained on this data, which we call RT-X, exhibits positive transfer and improves the capabilities of multiple robots by leveraging experience from other platforms.

| **[Exploring Pose-Guided Imitation Learning for Robotic Precise Insertion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09424v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have proved that imitation learning shows strong potential in the field of robotic manipulation. However, existing methods still struggle with precision manipulation task and rely on inefficient image/point cloud observations. In this paper, we explore to introduce SE(3) object pose into imitation learning and propose the pose-guided efficient imitation learning methods for robotic precise insertion task. First, we propose a precise insertion diffusion policy which utilizes the relative SE(3) pose as the observation-action pair. The policy models the source object SE(3) pose trajectory relative to the target object. Second, we explore to introduce the RGBD data to the pose-guided diffusion policy. Specifically, we design a goal-conditioned RGBD encoder to capture the discrepancy between the current state and the goal state. In addition, a pose-guided residual gated fusion method is proposed, which takes pose features as the backbone, and the RGBD features selectively compensate for pose feature deficiencies through an adaptive gating mechanism. Our methods are evaluated on 6 robotic precise insertion tasks, demonstrating competitive performance with only 7-10 demonstrations. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods can successfully complete precision insertion tasks with a clearance of about 0.01 mm. Experimental results highlight its superior efficiency and generalization capability compared to existing baselines.

While many potential benefits are associated with robotic care technologies, there is a variety of ethical challenges. To support steps towards a responsible implementation and use, this review develops an overview on ethical aspects of the use of social robots in elderly care from a decision-makers' perspective. Methods: Electronic databases were queried using a comprehensive search strategy based on the key concepts of "ethical aspects", "social robotics" and "elderly care". Abstract and title screening was conducted by two authors independently. Full-text screening was conducted by one author following a joint consolidation phase. Data was extracted using MAXQDA24 by one author, based on a consolidated coding framework. Analysis was performed through modified qualitative content analysis. Results: A total of 1,518 publications were screened, and 248 publications were included. We have organized our analysis in a scheme of ethical hazards, ethical opportunities and unsettled questions, identifying at least 60 broad ethical aspects affecting three different stakeholder groups. While some ethical issues are well-known and broadly discussed our analysis shows a plethora of potentially relevant aspects, often only marginally recognized, that are worthy of consideration from a practical perspective. Discussion: The findings highlight the need for a contextual and detailed evaluation of implementation scenarios. To make use of the vast knowledge of the ethical discourse, we hypothesize that decision-makers need to understand the specific nature of this discourse to be able to engage in careful ethical deliberation.</p></details> | <details><summary>93 pa...</summary><p>93 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables, 3 suplements</p></details> |
| **[A Bio-Inspired Research Paradigm of Collision Perception Neurons Enabling Neuro-Robotic Integration: The LGMD Case](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02982v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to human vision, locust visual systems excel at rapid and precise collision detection, despite relying on only hundreds of thousands of neurons organized through a few neuropils. This efficiency makes them an attractive model system for developing artificial collision-detecting systems. Specifically, researchers have identified collision-selective neurons in the locust's optic lobe, called lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs), which respond specifically to approaching objects. Research upon LGMD neurons began in the early 1970s. Initially, due to their large size, these neurons were identified as motion detectors, but their role as looming detectors was recognized over time. Since then, progress in neuroscience, computational modeling of LGMD's visual neural circuits, and LGMD-based robotics have advanced in tandem, each field supporting and driving the others. Today, with a deeper understanding of LGMD neurons, LGMD-based models have significantly improved collision-free navigation in mobile robots including ground and aerial robots. This review highlights recent developments in LGMD research from the perspectives of neuroscience, computational modeling, and robotics. It emphasizes a biologically plausible research paradigm, where insights from neuroscience inform real-world applications, which would in turn validate and advance neuroscience. With strong support from extensive research and growing application demand, this paradigm has reached a mature stage and demonstrates versatility across different areas of neuroscience research, thereby enhancing our understanding of the interconnections between neuroscience, computational modeling, and robotics. Furthermore, this paradigm would shed light upon the modeling and robotic research into other motion-sensitive neurons or neural circuits.</p></details> | 35 pages, 6 figures |

While modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can handle diverse robotic tasks, they often incur high per-step inference costs, resulting in significant latency, sometimes minutes per task. In contrast, RT-cache stores a large-scale Memory of previously successful robot trajectories and retrieves relevant multistep motion snippets, drastically reducing inference overhead. By integrating a Memory Builder with a Trajectory Retrieval, we develop an efficient retrieval process that remains tractable even for extremely large datasets. RT-cache flexibly accumulates real-world experiences and replays them whenever the current scene matches past states, adapting quickly to new or unseen environments with only a few additional samples. Experiments on the Open-X Embodiment Dataset and other real-world data demonstrate that RT-cache completes tasks both faster and more successfully than a baseline lacking retrieval, suggesting a practical, data-driven solution for real-time manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

In humans, inner speech structures thought processes and decision-making; in robotics, it improves explainability by making reasoning explicit. This is crucial in healthcare scenarios, where trust in robotic assistants depends on both accurate recommendations and human-like dialogue, which make interactions more natural and engaging. Building on this, we developed a social robot that provides dietary advice, and we provided the architecture with inner speech capabilities to validate user input, refine reasoning, and generate clear justifications. The system integrates large language models for natural language understanding and a knowledge graph for structured dietary information. By making decisions more transparent, our approach strengthens trust and improves human-robot interaction in healthcare. We validated this by measuring the computational efficiency of our architecture and conducting a small user study, which assessed the reliability of inner speech in explaining the robot's behavior.</p></details> |  |

However, these policies remain highly sensitive to domain shifts stemming from background or robot embodiment changes, which limits their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we present ARRO, a novel calibration-free visual representation that leverages zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation and object detection models to efficiently mask out task-irrelevant regions of the scene without requiring additional training. By filtering visual distractors and overlaying virtual guides during both training and inference, ARRO improves robustness to scene variations and reduces the need for additional data collection. We extensively evaluate ARRO with Diffusion Policy on several tabletop manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments, and further demonstrate its compatibility and effectiveness with generalist robot policies, such as Octo and OpenVLA. Across all settings in our evaluation, ARRO yields consistent performance gains, allows for selective masking to choose between different objects, and shows robustness even to challenging segmentation conditions.

We address these limitations by integrating DMP controllers into a BT framework, jointly learning the BT structure and DMP actions from single demonstrations, thereby removing the need for predefined actions. Additionally, by combining BT decision logic with DMP motion generation, our method enhances policy interpretability, modularity, and adaptability for autonomous systems. Our approach readily affords both learning to replicate low-level motions and combining partial demonstrations into a coherent and easy-to-modify overall policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, accepted (not yet published) at IAS19 2025 conference</p></details> |

Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, while building on top of general Vision-Language Models (VLMs), still fall short of achieving robust zero-shot performance due to the scarcity and heterogeneity prevalent in embodied datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FSD (From Seeing to Doing), a novel vision-language model that generates intermediate representations through spatial relationship reasoning, providing fine-grained guidance for robotic manipulation. Our approach combines a hierarchical data pipeline for training with a self-consistency mechanism that aligns spatial coordinates with visual signals. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively validated FSD's capabilities in both "seeing" and "doing," achieving outstanding performance across 8 benchmarks for general spatial reasoning and embodied reference abilities, as well as on our proposed more challenging benchmark VABench. We also verified zero-shot capabilities in robot manipulation, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods in both SimplerEnv and real robot settings. Experimental results show that FSD achieves 54.1% success rate in SimplerEnv and 72% success rate across 8 real-world tasks, outperforming the strongest baseline by 30%.</p></details> | Early version |

Although a few neurosymbolic frameworks have previously leveraged LLMs such as GPT-3 to address these challenges, reliance on closed-source, remote models with limited context introduced critical constraints: third-party dependency, inconsistent response times, restricted plan length and complexity, and multi-domain scalability issues. We present Gideon, a novel framework that enables the transition to modern, smaller, local LLMs with extended context length. Gideon integrates a novel problem generator to systematically generate large-scale datasets of realistic domain-problem-plan tuples for any domain, and adapts neurosymbolic planning for local LLMs, enabling on-device execution and extended context for multi-domain support. Preliminary experiments in single-domain scenarios performed on Qwen-2.5 1.5B and trained on 8k-32k samples, demonstrate a valid plan percentage of 66.1% (32k model) and show that the figure can be further scaled through additional data. Multi-domain tests on 16k samples yield an even higher 70.6% planning validity rate, proving extensibility across domains and signaling that data variety can have a positive effect on learning efficiency. Although long-horizon planning and reduced model size make Gideon training much less efficient than baseline models based on larger LLMs, the results are still significant considering that the trained model is about 120x smaller than baseline and that significant advantages can be achieved in inference efficiency, scalability, and multi-domain adaptability, all critical factors in human-robot collaboration. Training inefficiency can be mitigated by Gideon's streamlined data generation pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, accepted at IAS 2025</p></details> |

However, current VLA models face significant challenges: they are slow during inference and require extensive pre-training on large amounts of robotic data, making real-world deployment difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new family of compact vision-language-action models, called TinyVLA, which offers two key advantages over existing VLA models: (1) faster inference speeds, and (2) improved data efficiency, eliminating the need for pre-training stage. Our framework incorporates two essential components to build TinyVLA: (1) initializing the policy backbone with robust, high-speed multimodal models, and (2) integrating a diffusion policy decoder during fine-tuning to enable precise robot actions. We conducted extensive evaluations of TinyVLA in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model, OpenVLA, in terms of speed and data efficiency, while delivering comparable or superior performance. Additionally, TinyVLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various dimensions, including language instructions, novel objects, unseen positions, changes in object appearance, background variations, and environmental shifts, often matching or exceeding the performance of OpenVLA. We believe that \methodname offers an interesting perspective on utilizing pre-trained multimodal models for policy learning.

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is separable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such as laundry folding. In all settings, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models like Octo, OpenVLA, and Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The webpage is at https://dex-vla.github.io/</p></details> |

Traditional approaches fail to address dynamic rescheduling or diverse service requirements, typically restricting robots to single-task types. This paper tackles the Multi-Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (MPDPTW), where autonomous mobile robots are capable of handling varied service requests. The objective is to minimize late delivery penalties while maximizing task completion rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework leveraging a heterogeneous robot team and an efficient dynamic scheduling algorithm that supports dynamic task rescheduling. Users submit requests with specific time constraints, and our decentralized algorithm, Heterogeneous Mobile Robots Online Diverse Task Allocation (HMR-ODTA), optimizes task assignments to ensure timely service while addressing delays or task rejections. Extensive simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness. For smaller task sets (40-160 tasks), penalties were reduced by nearly 63%, while for larger sets (160-280 tasks), penalties decreased by approximately 50%. These results highlight the algorithm's effectiveness in improving task scheduling and coordination in multi-robot systems, offering a robust solution for enhancing delivery performance in structured, time-critical environments.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often rely on dense training datasets or explicit geometric modeling, limiting their scalability to real-world tasks. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offer new possibilities for integrating vision and language understanding, but their application to autonomous robotic grasping remains largely unexplored. We present ORACLE-Grasp, a zero-shot framework that leverages LMMs as semantic oracles to guide grasp selection without requiring additional training or human input. The system formulates grasp prediction as a structured, iterative decision process, using dual-prompt tool calling to first extract high-level object context and then select task-relevant grasp regions. By discretizing the image space and reasoning over candidate areas, ORACLE-Grasp mitigates the spatial imprecision common in LMMs and produces human-like, task-driven grasp suggestions. Early stopping and depth-based refinement steps further enhance efficiency and physical grasp reliability. Experiments demonstrate that the predicted grasps achieve low positional and orientation errors relative to human-annotated ground truth and lead to high success rates in real-world pick up tasks. These results highlight the potential of combining language-driven reasoning with lightweight vision techniques to enable robust, autonomous grasping without task-specific datasets or retraining.</p></details> |  |

Central to our approach is a next-token prediction objective, enabling the model to reason effectively over the user's query in the context of current observations. Subsequently, a diffusion model is attached to generate robust action outputs. To enhance policy learning through self-reasoning, we introduce a novel reasoning injection module that integrates reasoning phrases directly into the policy learning process. The whole framework is simple and flexible, making it easy to deploy and upgrade. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple real robots to validate the effectiveness of DiffusionVLA. Our tests include a challenging factory sorting task, where DiffusionVLA successfully categorizes objects, including those not seen during training. We observe that the reasoning module makes the model interpretable. It allows observers to understand the model thought process and identify potential causes of policy failures. Additionally, we test DiffusionVLA on a zero-shot bin-picking task, achieving 63.7\% accuracy on 102 previously unseen objects. Our method demonstrates robustness to visual changes, such as distractors and new backgrounds, and easily adapts to new embodiments. Furthermore, DiffusionVLA can follow novel instructions and retain conversational ability. Notably, DiffusionVLA is data-efficient and fast at inference; our smallest DiffusionVLA-2B runs 82Hz on a single A6000 GPU and can train from scratch on less than 50 demonstrations for a complex task. Finally, we scale the model from 2B to 72B parameters, showcasing improved generalization capabilities with increased model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project page is available at: http://diffusion-vla.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion Policy Optimization for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08376v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown the great potential of diffusion models in improving reinforcement learning (RL) by modeling complex policies, expressing a high degree of multi-modality, and efficiently handling high-dimensional continuous control tasks. However, there is currently limited research on how to optimize diffusion-based polices (e.g., Diffusion Policy) fast and stably. In this paper, we propose an Adam-based Diffusion Policy Optimization (ADPO), a fast algorithmic framework containing best practices for fine-tuning diffusion-based polices in robotic control tasks using the adaptive gradient descent method in RL. Adaptive gradient method is less studied in training RL, let alone diffusion-based policies. We confirm that ADPO outperforms other diffusion-based RL methods in terms of overall effectiveness for fine-tuning on standard robotic tasks. Concretely, we conduct extensive experiments on standard robotic control tasks to test ADPO, where, particularly, six popular diffusion-based RL methods are provided as benchmark methods. Experimental results show that ADPO acquires better or comparable performance than the baseline methods. Finally, we systematically analyze the sensitivity of multiple hyperparameters in standard robotics tasks, providing guidance for subsequent practical applications. Our video demonstrations are released in https://github.com/Timeless-lab/ADPO.git.</p></details> |  |

However, the improper frame sampling method and low training efficiency of current methods remain a critical bottleneck, resulting in substantial computational overhead and time costs. To address this limitation, we propose Motion-aware Rapid Reward Optimization for Efficient Robot Skill Learning from Single Videos (MA-ROESL). MA-ROESL integrates a motion-aware frame selection method to implicitly enhance the quality of VLM-generated reward functions. It further employs a hybrid three-phase training pipeline that improves training efficiency via rapid reward optimization and derives the final policy through online fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that MA-ROESL significantly enhances training efficiency while faithfully reproducing locomotion skills in both simulated and real-world settings, thereby underscoring its potential as a robust and scalable framework for efficient robot locomotion skill learning from video demonstrations.</p></details> |  |
| **[ERPoT: Effective and Reliable Pose Tracking for Mobile Robots Using Lightweight Polygon Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14723v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an effective and reliable pose tracking solution, termed ERPoT, for mobile robots operating in large-scale outdoor and challenging indoor environments, underpinned by an innovative prior polygon map. Especially, to overcome the challenge that arises as the map size grows with the expansion of the environment, the novel form of a prior map composed of multiple polygons is proposed. Benefiting from the use of polygons to concisely and accurately depict environmental occupancy, the prior polygon map achieves long-term reliable pose tracking while ensuring a compact form. More importantly, pose tracking is carried out under pure LiDAR mode, and the dense 3D point cloud is transformed into a sparse 2D scan through ground removal and obstacle selection. On this basis, a novel cost function for pose estimation through point-polygon matching is introduced, encompassing two distinct constraint forms: point-to-vertex and point-to-edge. In this study, our primary focus lies on two crucial aspects: lightweight and compact prior map construction, as well as effective and reliable robot pose tracking. Both aspects serve as the foundational pillars for future navigation across diverse mobile platforms equipped with different LiDAR sensors in varied environments. Comparative experiments based on the publicly available datasets and our self-recorded datasets are conducted, and evaluation results show the superior performance of ERPoT on reliability, prior map size, pose estimation error, and runtime over the other six approaches. The corresponding code can be accessed at https://github.com/ghm0819/ERPoT, and the supplementary video is at https://youtu.be/cseml5FrW1Q.</p></details> | 20 pages, 21 figures |

Observers based on proprioceptive information can be used for contact detection but have first-order error dynamics, which results in delays. Sensor fusion based on inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of accelerometers and gyroscopes is advantageous for reducing delays. The acceleration estimation enables the direct calculation of external forces. For serial robots, the installation of multiple accelerometers and gyroscopes is required for dynamics modeling since the joint coordinates are the minimal coordinates. Alternatively, parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential to use only one IMU on the end-effector platform, which already presents the minimal coordinates of the PR. This work introduces a sensor-fusion method for contact detection using encoders and only one low-cost, consumer-grade IMU for a PR. The end-effector accelerations are estimated by an extended Kalman filter and incorporated into the dynamics to calculate external forces. In real-world experiments with a planar PR, we demonstrate that this approach reduces the detection duration by up to 50% compared to a momentum observer and enables the collision and clamping detection within 3-39ms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of a publication accepted for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

However, two issues need to be considered when applying it in field environments: one is resource limitation, and the other is inter/intra-robot association. The resource limitation issue arises when the data size exceeds the processing capacity of the network or memory, especially when utilizing communication systems or onboard computers in the field. The inter/intra-robot association issue occurs due to the narrow convergence region of ICP under large viewpoint differences, triggering many false positive loops and ultimately resulting in an inconsistent global map for multi-robot systems. To tackle these problems, we propose a distributed LiDAR SLAM framework designed for versatile field applications, called SKiD-SLAM. Extending our previous work that solely focused on lightweight place recognition and fast and robust global registration, we present a multi-robot mapping framework that focuses on robust and lightweight inter-robot loop closure in distributed LiDAR SLAM. Through various environmental experiments, we demonstrate that our method is more robust and lightweight compared to other state-of-the-art distributed SLAM approaches, overcoming resource limitation and inter/intra-robot association issues. Also, we validated the field applicability of our approach through mapping experiments in real-world planetary emulation terrain and cave environments, which are in-house datasets. Our code will be available at https://sparolab.github.io/research/skid_slam/.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Rethink Repeatable Measures of Robot Performance with Statistical Query](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08216v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a general standardized testing algorithm designed to evaluate a specific aspect of a robot's performance, several key expectations are commonly imposed. Beyond accuracy (i.e., closeness to a typically unknown ground-truth reference) and efficiency (i.e., feasibility within acceptable testing costs and equipment constraints), one particularly important attribute is repeatability. Repeatability refers to the ability to consistently obtain the same testing outcome when similar testing algorithms are executed on the same subject robot by different stakeholders, across different times or locations. However, achieving repeatable testing has become increasingly challenging as the components involved grow more complex, intelligent, diverse, and, most importantly, stochastic. While related efforts have addressed repeatability at ethical, hardware, and procedural levels, this study focuses specifically on repeatable testing at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we target the well-adopted class of testing algorithms in standardized evaluation: statistical query (SQ) algorithms (i.e., algorithms that estimate the expected value of a bounded function over a distribution using sampled data). We propose a lightweight, parameterized, and adaptive modification applicable to any SQ routine, whether based on Monte Carlo sampling, importance sampling, or adaptive importance sampling, that makes it provably repeatable, with guaranteed bounds on both accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three representative scenarios: (i) established and widely adopted standardized testing of manipulators, (ii) emerging intelligent testing algorithms for operational risk assessment in automated vehicles, and (iii) developing use cases involving command tracking performance evaluation of humanoid robots in locomotion tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Latent Redundancy in Behavior Cloning: An Information Bottleneck Approach for Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02853v5)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behavior Cloning (BC) is a widely adopted visual imitation learning method in robot manipulation. Current BC approaches often enhance generalization by leveraging large datasets and incorporating additional visual and textual modalities to capture more diverse information. However, these methods overlook whether the learned representations contain redundant information and lack a solid theoretical foundation to guide the learning process. To address these limitations, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective and introduce mutual information to quantify and mitigate redundancy in latent representations. Building on this, we incorporate the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle into BC, which extends the idea of reducing redundancy by providing a structured framework for compressing irrelevant information while preserving task-relevant features. This work presents the first comprehensive study on redundancy in latent representations across various methods, backbones, and experimental settings, while extending the generalizability of the IB to BC. Extensive experiments and analyses on the CortexBench and LIBERO benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements with IB, underscoring the importance of reducing input data redundancy and highlighting its practical value for more practical applications.

However, existing neural architectures that support heterogeneous teaming tend to force a trade-off between expressivity and efficiency. Shared-parameter designs prioritize sample efficiency by enabling a single network to be shared across all or a pre-specified subset of robots (via input augmentations), but tend to limit behavioral diversity. In contrast, recent designs employ a separate policy for each robot, enabling greater diversity and expressivity at the cost of efficiency and generalization. Our key insight is that such tradeoffs can be avoided by viewing these design choices as ends of a broad spectrum. Inspired by recent work in transfer and meta learning, and building on prior work in multi-robot task allocation, we propose Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a soft weight sharing architecture that uses hypernetworks to efficiently learn a flexible shared policy that dynamically adapts to each robot post-training. By explicitly encoding the impact of robot capabilities (e.g., speed and payload) on collective behavior, CASH enables zero-shot generalization to unseen robots or team compositions. Our experiments involve multiple heterogeneous tasks, three learning paradigms (imitation learning, value-based, and policy-gradient RL), and SOTA multi-robot simulation (JaxMARL) and hardware (Robotarium) platforms. Across all conditions, we find that CASH generates appropriately-diverse behaviors and consistently outperforms baseline architectures in terms of performance and sample efficiency during both training and zero-shot generalization, all with 60%-80% fewer learnable parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, equal authorship between Kevin Fu and Shalin Anand Jain</p></details> |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning for Robotic Leaf Manipulation: A Hybrid Geometric-Neural Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03702v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating leaf manipulation in agricultural settings faces significant challenges, including the variability of plant morphologies and deformable leaves. We propose a novel hybrid geometric-neural approach for autonomous leaf grasping that combines traditional computer vision with neural networks through self-supervised learning. Our method integrates YOLOv8 for instance segmentation and RAFT-Stereo for 3D depth estimation to build rich leaf representations, which feed into both a geometric feature scoring pipeline and a neural refinement module (GraspPointCNN). The key innovation is our confidence-weighted fusion mechanism that dynamically balances the contribution of each approach based on prediction certainty. Our self-supervised framework uses the geometric pipeline as an expert teacher to automatically generate training data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves an 88.0% success rate in controlled environments and 84.7% in real greenhouse conditions, significantly outperforming both purely geometric (75.3%) and neural (60.2%) methods. This work establishes a new paradigm for agricultural robotics where domain expertise is seamlessly integrated with machine learning capabilities, providing a foundation for fully automated crop monitoring systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[What Matters for Batch Online Reinforcement Learning in Robotics?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08078v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to learn from large batches of autonomously collected data for policy improvement -- a paradigm we refer to as batch online reinforcement learning -- holds the promise of enabling truly scalable robot learning by significantly reducing the need for human effort of data collection while getting benefits from self-improvement. Yet, despite the promise of this paradigm, it remains challenging to achieve due to algorithms not being able to learn effectively from the autonomous data. For example, prior works have applied imitation learning and filtered imitation learning methods to the batch online RL problem, but these algorithms often fail to efficiently improve from the autonomously collected data or converge quickly to a suboptimal point. This raises the question of what matters for effective batch online RL in robotics. Motivated by this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of three axes -- (i) algorithm class, (ii) policy extraction methods, and (iii) policy expressivity -- and analyze how these axes affect performance and scaling with the amount of autonomous data. Through our analysis, we make several observations. First, we observe that the use of Q-functions to guide batch online RL significantly improves performance over imitation-based methods. Building on this, we show that an implicit method of policy extraction -- via choosing the best action in the distribution of the policy -- is necessary over traditional policy extraction methods from offline RL. Next, we show that an expressive policy class is preferred over less expressive policy classes. Based on this analysis, we propose a general recipe for effective batch online RL. We then show a simple addition to the recipe of using temporally-correlated noise to obtain more diversity results in further performance gains. Our recipe obtains significantly better performance and scaling compared to prior methods.</p></details> |  |

This integration presents both unprecedented opportunities and notable challenges for effective collaboration. However, the active guidance of human actions and their integration in co-learning processes, where humans and robots mutually learn from each other, remains under-explored. This article demonstrates how consensus between human and robot opinions can be established by modeling decision-making processes as non-linear opinion dynamics. We utilize dynamic bias as a control parameter to steer the robot's opinion toward consensus and employ visual cues via a robotic eye gaze to guide human decisions. These non-verbal cues communicate the robot's future intentions, gradually guiding human decisions to align with them. To design robot behavior for consensus, we integrate a human opinion observation algorithm with the robot's opinion formation, controlling its actions based on that formed opinion. Experiments with $51$ participants ($N=51$) in a two-choice decision-making task show that effective consensus and trust can be established in a human--robot co-learning setting by guiding human decisions through nonverbal robotic cues and using bias-controlled opinion dynamics to shape robot behavior. Finally, we provide detailed information on the perceived cognitive load and the behavior of robotic eyes based on user feedback and post-experiment interviews.</p></details> | 48 pages, 8 figures |

However, controlling their behavior is challenging due to their nonlinear material response and infinite degrees of freedom. A potential solution to these challenges is to discretize the infinite-dimensional configuration space into a finite but sufficiently large number of functional modes with programmed dynamics. We present a strategy for co-designing the desired tasks and morphology of pneumatically actuated soft robots with multiple encoded stable states and dynamic responses. Our approach introduces a general method to capture the soft robots' response using an energy-based analytical model, the parameters of which are obtained using Recursive Feature Elimination. The resulting lumped-parameter model facilitates inverse co-design of the robot's morphology and planned tasks by embodying specific dynamics upon actuation. We illustrate our approach's ability to explore the configuration space by co-designing kinematics with optimized stiffnesses and time responses to obtain robots capable of classifying the size and weight of objects and displaying adaptable locomotion with minimal feedback control. This strategy offers a framework for simplifying the control of soft robots by exploiting the nonlinear mechanics of multistable structures and embodying mechanical intelligence into soft material systems</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript: 13 pages, 5 figures ; Supplementary Information: 9 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates text-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot control. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric representation-can be extracted from videos in a self-supervised manner, enabling diffusion model training on web-scale video-caption data. Treating generated pixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level System 1 module translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action mapping functions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal supervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse temporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal intervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and generalizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings, bridging the gap between language, motion, and action.

While teleoperation provides high-fidelity datasets, its high cost limits its scalability. Instead, what if people could use their own hands, just as they do in everyday life, to collect data? In DexWild, a diverse team of data collectors uses their hands to collect hours of interactions across a multitude of environments and objects. To record this data, we create DexWild-System, a low-cost, mobile, and easy-to-use device. The DexWild learning framework co-trains on both human and robot demonstrations, leading to improved performance compared to training on each dataset individually. This combination results in robust robot policies capable of generalizing to novel environments, tasks, and embodiments with minimal additional robot-specific data. Experimental results demonstrate that DexWild significantly improves performance, achieving a 68.5% success rate in unseen environments-nearly four times higher than policies trained with robot data only-and offering 5.8x better cross-embodiment generalization.

However, its traditional implementation as a singular static unit limits its dynamic range and application versatility. This paper introduces AcoustoBots - a novel convergence of acoustophoresis with a movable and reconfigurable phased array of transducers for enhanced application versatility. We mount a phased array of transducers on a swarm of robots to harness the benefits of multiple mobile acoustophoretic units. This offers a more flexible and interactive platform that enables a swarm of acoustophoretic multimodal interactions. Our novel AcoustoBots design includes a hinge actuation system that controls the orientation of the mounted phased array of transducers to achieve high flexibility in a swarm of acoustophoretic multimodal interactions. In addition, we designed a BeadDispenserBot that can deliver particles to trapping locations, which automates the acoustic levitation interaction. These attributes allow AcoustoBots to independently work for a common cause and interchange between modalities, allowing for novel augmentations (e.g., a swarm of haptics, audio, and levitation) and bilateral interactions with users in an expanded interaction area. We detail our design considerations, challenges, and methodological approach to extend acoustophoretic central control in distributed settings. This work demonstrates a scalable acoustic control framework with two mobile robots, laying the groundwork for future deployment in larger robotic swarms. Finally, we characterize the performance of our AcoustoBots and explore the potential interactive scenarios they can enable.</p></details> |  |

To better understand user perceptions of privacy in relation to visual data, we conducted a user study investigating how different image modalities and image resolutions affect users' privacy concerns. The results show that depth images are broadly viewed as privacy-safe, and a similarly high proportion of respondents feel the same about semantic segmentation images. Additionally, the majority of participants consider 32*32 resolution RGB images to be almost sufficiently privacy-preserving, while most believe that 16*16 resolution can fully guarantee privacy protection.</p></details> |  |

This study presents hazard driven low-level control strategies implemented in robot-assisted dressing (RAD) scenarios where hazards like garment snags and user discomfort in real-time can affect task performance and user safety. The proposed control mechanisms include: (1) Garment Snagging Control Strategy, which detects excessive forces and either seeks user intervention via a chatbot or autonomously adjusts its trajectory, and (2) User Discomfort/Pain Mitigation Strategy, which dynamically reduces velocity based on user feedback and aborts the task if necessary. We used physical dressing trials in order to evaluate these control strategies. Results confirm that integrating force monitoring with user feedback improves safety and task continuity. The findings emphasise the need for hybrid approaches that balance autonomous intervention, user involvement, and controlled task termination, supported by bi-directional interaction and real-time user-driven adaptability, paving the way for more responsive and personalised HRI systems.</p></details> |  |

This approach emulates the intuitiveness of physical human-robot interaction, but at the same time it permits to teleoperate the robot from a safe distance, in a way that resembles a "Marionette" interface. The system is further enhanced with wearable haptic feedback functions to align better with the "Marionette" metaphor, and a user study has been conducted to validate its efficacy with and without the haptic channel enabled. Considering the importance of robot independence, the TelePhysicalOperation interface incorporates autonomy modules to face, for example, the teleoperation of dual-arm mobile base robots for bimanual object grasping and transportation tasks. With the laser-guided interface, the user can indicate points of interest to the robot through the utilization of a simple but effective laser emitter device. With a neural network-based vision system, the robot tracks the laser projection in real time, allowing the user to indicate not only fixed goals, like objects, but also paths to follow. With the implemented autonomous behavior, a mobile manipulator employs its locomanipulation abilities to follow the indicated goals. The behavior is modeled using Behavior Trees, exploiting their reactivity to promptly respond to changes in goal positions, and their modularity to adapt the motion planning to the task needs. The proposed laser interface has also been employed in an assistive scenario. In this case, users with upper limbs impairments can control an assistive manipulator by directing a head-worn laser emitter to the point of interests, to collaboratively address activities of everyday life.

In contrast, humans are able to learn efficiently by watching others interact with their environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce semantic action flow as a core intermediate representation capturing the essential spatio-temporal manipulator-object interactions, invariant to superficial visual differences. We present ViSA-Flow, a framework that learns this representation self-supervised from unlabeled large-scale video data. First, a generative model is pre-trained on semantic action flows automatically extracted from large-scale human-object interaction video data, learning a robust prior over manipulation structure. Second, this prior is efficiently adapted to a target robot by fine-tuning on a small set of robot demonstrations processed through the same semantic abstraction pipeline. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world tasks that ViSA-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-data regimes, outperforming prior methods by effectively transferring knowledge from human video observation to robotic execution.

We also address tasks that must be performed by a coalition of robots in a coordinated manner. Given these features, we introduce a new class of heterogeneous MRTA problems which we analyze theoretically and optimally formulate as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program. We then contribute a heuristic algorithm to compute approximate solutions and integrate it into a mission planning and execution architecture capable of reacting to unexpected events by repairing or recomputing plans online. Our experimental results show the relevance of our newly formulated problem in a realistic use case for inspection with aerial robots. We assess the performance of our heuristic solver in comparison with other variants and with exact optimal solutions in small-scale scenarios.

However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoptic, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 35 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |

However, they continue to experience crippling long-tail latency spikes whenever bursty request streams exceed the capacity of heterogeneous edge and cloud tiers. To address these long-tail latency issues, we present Latency-Aware, Predictive In-Memory Routing and Proactive Autoscaling (LA-IMR). This control layer integrates a closed-form, utilization-driven latency model with event-driven scheduling, replica autoscaling, and edge-to-cloud offloading to mitigate 99th-percentile (P99) delays. Our analytic model decomposes end-to-end latency into processing, network, and queuing components, expressing inference latency as an affine power-law function of instance utilization. Once calibrated, it produces two complementary functions that drive: (i) millisecond-scale routing decisions for traffic offloading, and (ii) capacity planning that jointly determines replica pool sizes. LA-IMR enacts these decisions through a quality-differentiated, multi-queue scheduler and a custom-metric Kubernetes autoscaler that scales replicas proactively -- before queues build up -- rather than reactively based on lagging CPU metrics. Across representative vision workloads (YOLOv5m and EfficientDet) and bursty arrival traces, LA-IMR reduces P99 latency by up to 20.7 percent compared to traditional latency-only autoscaling, laying a principled foundation for next-generation, tail-tolerant cloud-edge inference services.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, the variable quality of training data often constrains the performance of these models. On the other hand, offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at learning robust policy models from mixed-quality data. In this paper, we introduce Reinforced robot GPT (ReinboT), a novel end-to-end VLA model that integrates the RL principle of maximizing cumulative reward. ReinboT achieves a deeper understanding of the data quality distribution by predicting dense returns that capture the nuances of manipulation tasks. The dense return prediction capability enables the robot to generate more robust decision-making actions, oriented towards maximizing future benefits. Extensive experiments show that ReinboT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN mixed-quality dataset and exhibits superior few-shot learning and out-of-distribution generalization capabilities in real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-enhanced Decision-Making for Autonomous Mobile Robots in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11901v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of robots in shared environments -- such as warehouses, shopping centres, and hospitals -- demands a deep understanding of the underlying dynamics and human behaviours, including how, when, and where individuals engage in various activities and interactions. This knowledge goes beyond simple correlation studies and requires a more comprehensive causal analysis. By leveraging causal inference to model cause-and-effect relationships, we can better anticipate critical environmental factors and enable autonomous robots to plan and execute tasks more effectively. To this end, we propose a novel causality-based decision-making framework that reasons over a learned causal model to predict battery usage and human obstructions, understanding how these factors could influence robot task execution. Such reasoning framework assists the robot in deciding when and how to complete a given task. To achieve this, we developed also PeopleFlow, a new Gazebo-based simulator designed to model context-sensitive human-robot spatial interactions in shared workspaces. PeopleFlow features realistic human and robot trajectories influenced by contextual factors such as time, environment layout, and robot state, and can simulate a large number of agents. While the simulator is general-purpose, in this paper we focus on a warehouse-like environment as a case study, where we conduct an extensive evaluation benchmarking our causal approach against a non-causal baseline. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solutions, highlighting how causal reasoning enables autonomous robots to operate more efficiently and safely in dynamic environments shared with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Causa...</summary><p>Causal Discovery and Inference - Robot Autonomy - Human-Robot Spatial Interaction - Decision-Making</p></details> |

| **[Autonomous Robotic Pruning in Orchards and Vineyards: a Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07318v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manual pruning is labor intensive and represents up to 25% of annual labor costs in fruit production, notably in apple orchards and vineyards where operational challenges and cost constraints limit the adoption of large-scale machinery. In response, a growing body of research is investigating compact, flexible robotic platforms capable of precise pruning in varied terrains, particularly where traditional mechanization falls short. This paper reviews recent advances in autonomous robotic pruning for orchards and vineyards, addressing a critical need in precision agriculture. Our review examines literature published between 2014 and 2024, focusing on innovative contributions across key system components. Special attention is given to recent developments in machine vision, perception, plant skeletonization, and control strategies, areas that have experienced significant influence from advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The analysis situates these technological trends within broader agricultural challenges, including rising labor costs, a decline in the number of young farmers, and the diverse pruning requirements of different fruit species such as apple, grapevine, and cherry trees. By comparing various robotic architectures and methodologies, this survey not only highlights the progress made toward autonomous pruning but also identifies critical open challenges and future research directions. The findings underscore the potential of robotic systems to bridge the gap between manual and mechanized operations, paving the way for more efficient, sustainable, and precise agricultural practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stereo Hand-Object Reconstruction for Human-to-Robot Handover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07487v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jointly estimating hand and object shape facilitates the grasping task in human-to-robot handovers. However, relying on hand-crafted prior knowledge about the geometric structure of the object fails when generalising to unseen objects, and depth sensors fail to detect transparent objects such as drinking glasses. In this work, we propose a stereo-based method for hand-object reconstruction that combines single-view reconstructions probabilistically to form a coherent stereo reconstruction. We learn 3D shape priors from a large synthetic hand-object dataset to ensure that our method is generalisable, and use RGB inputs to better capture transparent objects. We show that our method reduces the object Chamfer distance compared to existing RGB based hand-object reconstruction methods on single view and stereo settings. We process the reconstructed hand-object shape with a projection-based outlier removal step and use the output to guide a human-to-robot handover pipeline with wide-baseline stereo RGB cameras. Our hand-object reconstruction enables a robot to successfully receive a diverse range of household objects from the human.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table.

It holds particular promise for soft robots, which are amenable to novel manufacturing techniques that can realize learned morphologies and actuators. Inspired by nature and recent novel robot designs, we propose to go a step further and explore the novel reconfigurable robots, defined as robots that can change their morphology within their lifetime. We formalize control of reconfigurable soft robots as a high-dimensional reinforcement learning (RL) problem. We unify morphology change, locomotion, and environment interaction in the same action space, and introduce an appropriate, coarse-to-fine curriculum that enables us to discover policies that accomplish fine-grained control of the resulting robots. We also introduce DittoGym, a comprehensive RL benchmark for reconfigurable soft robots that require fine-grained morphology changes to accomplish the tasks. Finally, we evaluate our proposed coarse-to-fine algorithm on DittoGym and demonstrate robots that learn to change their morphology several times within a sequence, uniquely enabled by our RL algorithm.

Our system enables users to visualize robot perception outputs such as object detection and segmentation results using a MR device. Therefore, users can inspect failures of perception models using the system on real robots. Moreover, iTeach facilitates real-time, informed data collection and annotation, where users can use hand gesture, eye gaze and voice commands to annotate images collected from robots. The annotated images can be used to fine-tune perception models to improve their accuracy and adaptability. The system continually improves perception models by collecting annotations of failed examples from users. When applied to object detection and unseen object instance segmentation (UOIS) tasks, iTeach demonstrates encouraging results in improving pre-trained vision models for these two tasks. These results highlight the potential of MR to make robotic perception systems more capable and adaptive in real-world environments.

| **[Being-0: A Humanoid Robotic Agent with Vision-Language Models and Modular Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12533v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building autonomous robotic agents capable of achieving human-level performance in real-world embodied tasks is an ultimate goal in humanoid robot research. Recent advances have made significant progress in high-level cognition with Foundation Models (FMs) and low-level skill development for humanoid robots. However, directly combining these components often results in poor robustness and efficiency due to compounding errors in long-horizon tasks and the varied latency of different modules. We introduce Being-0, a hierarchical agent framework that integrates an FM with a modular skill library. The FM handles high-level cognitive tasks such as instruction understanding, task planning, and reasoning, while the skill library provides stable locomotion and dexterous manipulation for low-level control. To bridge the gap between these levels, we propose a novel Connector module, powered by a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). The Connector enhances the FM's embodied capabilities by translating language-based plans into actionable skill commands and dynamically coordinating locomotion and manipulation to improve task success. With all components, except the FM, deployable on low-cost onboard computation devices, Being-0 achieves efficient, real-time performance on a full-sized humanoid robot equipped with dexterous hands and active vision. Extensive experiments in large indoor environments demonstrate Being-0's effectiveness in solving complex, long-horizon tasks that require challenging navigation and manipulation subtasks.

Designed in collaboration with AstraZeneca, the challenge invited academic teams to develop autonomous robotic systems capable of navigating human-populated lab spaces and performing complex manipulation tasks, such as loading items into industrial dishwashers. This paper presents an overview of the challenge setup, its industrial motivation, and the four distinct approaches proposed by the participating teams. We summarize lessons learned from this edition and propose improvements in design to enable a more effective second iteration to take place in 2025. The initiative bridges an important gap in effective academia-industry collaboration within the domain of autonomous mobile manipulation systems by promoting the development and deployment of applied robotic solutions in real-world laboratory contexts.</p></details> |  |

ML models, especially artificial neural networks (ANNs), can provide advanced decision-making and control capabilities by learning from data. However, they often function as black boxes, making it challenging to interpret them. This is especially a problem in safety-critical control applications. To generate realistic CFEs, we parameterize the LiDAR space with simple shapes such as circles and rectangles, whose parameters are chosen by a genetic algorithm, and the configurations are transformed into LiDAR data by raycasting. Our model-agnostic approach generates CFEs in the form of synthetic LiDAR data that resembles a base LiDAR state but is modified to produce a pre-defined ML model control output based on a query from the user. We demonstrate our method on a mobile robot, the TurtleBot3, controlled using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in real-world and simulated scenarios. Our method generates logical and realistic CFEs, which helps to interpret the DRL agent's decision making. This paper contributes towards advancing explainable AI in mobile robotics, and our method could be a tool for understanding, debugging, and improving ML-based autonomous control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2025 European Control Conference (ECC)</p></details> |
| **[FACET: Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking for Legged Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06883v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in legged robot control, enabling locomotion across diverse terrains and complex loco-manipulation capabilities. However, the commonly used position or velocity tracking-based objectives are agnostic to forces experienced by the robot, leading to stiff and potentially dangerous behaviors and poor control during forceful interactions. To address this limitation, we present \emph{Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking} (FACET). Inspired by impedance control, we use RL to train a control policy to imitate a virtual mass-spring-damper system, allowing fine-grained control under external forces by manipulating the virtual spring. In simulation, we demonstrate that our quadruped robot achieves improved robustness to large impulses (up to 200 Ns) and exhibits controllable compliance, achieving an 80% reduction in collision impulse. The policy is deployed to a physical robot to showcase both compliance and the ability to engage with large forces by kinesthetic control and pulling payloads up to 2/3 of its weight. Further extension to a legged loco-manipulator and a humanoid shows the applicability of our method to more complex settings to enable whole-body compliance control.

| **[Efficient Robotic Policy Learning via Latent Space Backward Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06861v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current robotic planning methods often rely on predicting multi-frame images with full pixel details. While this fine-grained approach can serve as a generic world model, it introduces two significant challenges for downstream policy learning: substantial computational costs that hinder real-time deployment, and accumulated inaccuracies that can mislead action extraction. Planning with coarse-grained subgoals partially alleviates efficiency issues. However, their forward planning schemes can still result in off-task predictions due to accumulation errors, leading to misalignment with long-term goals. This raises a critical question: Can robotic planning be both efficient and accurate enough for real-time control in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks? To address this, we propose a Latent Space Backward Planning scheme (LBP), which begins by grounding the task into final latent goals, followed by recursively predicting intermediate subgoals closer to the current state. The grounded final goal enables backward subgoal planning to always remain aware of task completion, facilitating on-task prediction along the entire planning horizon. The subgoal-conditioned policy incorporates a learnable token to summarize the subgoal sequences and determines how each subgoal guides action extraction. Through extensive simulation and real-robot long-horizon experiments, we show that LBP outperforms existing fine-grained and forward planning methods, achieving SOTA performance.

The proposed framework integrates a robust state estimator capable of accurately reconstructing neighboring agents' velocity vectors and orientations under varying dynamic conditions, with a decentralized formation tracking controller that leverages Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee collision avoidance and inter-agent safety. We present a closed-form control law that ensures both stability and string stability, effectively attenuating disturbances propagating from leader to followers. The theoretical foundations of the estimator and controller are established using Lyapunov stability analysis, which confirms global asymptotic stability under constant velocities and global uniformly ultimate boundedness under time-varying conditions. Extensive numerical simulations and realistic Gazebo-based experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and practical applicability of the proposed method, demonstrating precise formation tracking, stringent safety maintenance, and disturbance resilience without relying on inter-robot communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

However, established MARL platforms (e.g., SMAC and MPE) lack robotics relevance and hardware deployment, leaving multi-robot learning researchers to develop bespoke environments and hardware testbeds dedicated to the development and evaluation of their individual contributions. The Multi-Agent RL Benchmark and Learning Environment for the Robotarium (MARBLER) is an exciting recent step in providing a standardized robotics-relevant platform for MARL, by bridging the Robotarium testbed with existing MARL software infrastructure. However, MARBLER lacks support for parallelization and GPU/TPU execution, making the platform prohibitively slow compared to modern MARL environments and hindering adoption. We contribute JaxRobotarium, a Jax-powered end-to-end simulation, learning, deployment, and benchmarking platform for the Robotarium. JaxRobotarium enables rapid training and deployment of multi-robot reinforcement learning (MRRL) policies with realistic robot dynamics and safety constraints, supporting both parallelization and hardware acceleration. Our generalizable learning interface provides an easy-to-use integration with SOTA MARL libraries (e.g., JaxMARL). In addition, JaxRobotarium includes eight standardized coordination scenarios, including four novel scenarios that bring established MARL benchmark tasks (e.g., RWARE and Level-Based Foraging) to a realistic robotics setting. We demonstrate that JaxRobotarium retains high simulation fidelity while achieving dramatic speedups over baseline (20x in training and 150x in simulation), and provides an open-access sim-to-real evaluation pipeline through the Robotarium testbed, accelerating and democratizing access to multi-robot learning research and evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[HAMSTER: Hierarchical Action Models For Open-World Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05485v4)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

However, network intrusion to IoRT can lead to data leakage, service interruption in IoRT and even physical damage by controlling robots or vehicles. This paper proposes a Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning Network Intrusion Detection framework (CFedSSL-NID) for IoRT intrusion detection and defense, to address the practical scenario of IoRT where robots don't possess labeled data locally and the requirement for data privacy preserving. CFedSSL-NID integrates randomly weak and strong augmentation, latent contrastive learning, and EMA update to integrate supervised signals, thereby enhancing performance and robustness on robots' local unlabeled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CFedSSL-NID outperforms existing federated semi-supervised and fully supervised methods on benchmark dataset and has lower resource requirements.</p></details> |  |

Although prior work has demonstrated skateboarding for quadrupeds that are already positioned on the board, the initial mounting phase still poses a significant challenge. A goal-oriented methodology was adopted, beginning with the terminal phases of the task and progressively increasing the complexity of the problem definition to approximate the desired objective. The learning process was initiated with the skateboard rigidly fixed within the global coordinate frame and the robot positioned directly above it. Through gradual relaxation of these initial conditions, the learned policy demonstrated robustness to variations in skateboard position and orientation, ultimately exhibiting a successful transfer to scenarios involving a mobile skateboard.

A key bottleneck is that collecting robotic data often requires expertise or specialized hardware, limiting accessibility and scalability. We posit that natural language offers an intuitive and accessible interface for robot learning. To this end, we study two aspects: (1) enabling non-experts to collect robotic data through natural language supervision (e.g., "move the arm to the right") and (2) training robot policies directly from this supervision. Specifically, we introduce a data collection framework that collects robot demonstrations based on natural language supervision and further augments these demonstrations. We then present CLIP-RT, a new vision-language-action (VLA) model that learns language-conditioned visuomotor policies from this supervision. CLIP-RT adapts the pretrained CLIP model and learns to predict language-based motion primitives via contrastive imitation learning. We train CLIP-RT on the Open X-Embodiment dataset and finetune it on in-domain data collected by our framework. In real-world evaluations, CLIP-RT demonstrates strong capabilities in learning novel manipulation skills, outperforming OpenVLA (7B parameters) by 24% in average success rates, while using 7x fewer parameters (1B). We further assess CLIP-RT's capabilities in few-shot generalization and collaborative scenarios involving large pretrained models or humans. In simulated environments, CLIP-RT also yields strong performance, achieving a 93.1% average success rate on the LIBERO benchmark with an inference throughput of 163 Hz.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RSS 2025.

Inspired by these developments, researchers have begun exploring the use of LLMs as decentralized decision-makers for multi-robot formation control. However, prior studies reveal that directly applying LLMs to such tasks often leads to unstable and inconsistent behaviors, where robots may collapse to the centroid of their positions or diverge entirely due to hallucinated reasoning, logical inconsistencies, and limited coordination awareness. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that integrates LLMs with an influence-based plan consensus protocol. In this framework, each robot independently generates a local plan toward the desired formation using its own LLM. The robots then iteratively refine their plans through a decentralized consensus protocol that accounts for their influence on neighboring robots. This process drives the system toward a coherent and stable flocking formation in a fully decentralized manner. We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulations involving both state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs (e.g., o3-mini, Claude 3.5) and open-source models (e.g., Llama3.1-405b, Qwen-Max, DeepSeek-R1). The results show notable improvements in stability, convergence, and adaptability over previous LLM-based methods. We further validate our framework on a physical team of Crazyflie drones, demonstrating its practical viability and effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems.</p></details> |  |

This becomes particularly challenging in perception-degraded subterranean conditions under harsh environmental factors, including darkness, dust, and geometrically self-similar structures. This paper details CompSLAM, a highly resilient and hierarchical multi-modal localization and mapping framework designed to address these challenges. Its flexible architecture achieves resilience through redundancy by leveraging the complementary nature of pose estimates derived from diverse sensor modalities. Developed during the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, CompSLAM was successfully deployed on all aerial, legged, and wheeled robots of Team Cerberus during their competition-winning final run. Furthermore, it has proven to be a reliable odometry and mapping solution in various subsequent projects, with extensions enabling multi-robot map sharing for marsupial robotic deployments and collaborative mapping. This paper also introduces a comprehensive dataset acquired by a manually teleoperated quadrupedal robot, covering a significant portion of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge finals course. This dataset evaluates CompSLAM's robustness to sensor degradations as the robot traverses 740 meters in an environment characterized by highly variable geometries and demanding lighting conditions.

Researchers have explored how Large Language Models (LLMs) could enable non-expert users to specify reward functions more easily. However, LLMs struggle to balance the importance of different features, generalize poorly to out-of-distribution robotic tasks, and cannot represent the problem properly with only text-based descriptions. To address these challenges, we propose ELEMENTAL (intEractive LEarning froM dEmoNstraTion And Language), a novel framework that combines natural language guidance with visual user demonstrations to align robot behavior with user intentions better. By incorporating visual inputs, ELEMENTAL overcomes the limitations of text-only task specifications, while leveraging inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to balance feature weights and match the demonstrated behaviors optimally. ELEMENTAL also introduces an iterative feedback-loop through self-reflection to improve feature, reward, and policy learning. Our experiment results demonstrate that ELEMENTAL outperforms prior work by 42.3% on task success, and achieves 41.3% better generalization in out-of-distribution tasks, highlighting its robustness in LfD.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
