| **[STI-Bench: Are MLLMs Ready for Precise Spatial-Temporal World Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23765v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functionality understanding and segmentation in 3D scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16310v4)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

| **[SIGHT: Single-Image Conditioned Generation of Hand Trajectories for Hand-Object Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22869v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel task of generating realistic and diverse 3D hand trajectories given a single image of an object, which could be involved in a hand-object interaction scene or pictured by itself. When humans grasp an object, appropriate trajectories naturally form in our minds to use it for specific tasks. Hand-object interaction trajectory priors can greatly benefit applications in robotics, embodied AI, augmented reality and related fields. However, synthesizing realistic and appropriate hand trajectories given a single object or hand-object interaction image is a highly ambiguous task, requiring to correctly identify the object of interest and possibly even the correct interaction among many possible alternatives. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose the SIGHT-Fusion system, consisting of a curated pipeline for extracting visual features of hand-object interaction details from egocentric videos involving object manipulation, and a diffusion-based conditional motion generation model processing the extracted features. We train our method given video data with corresponding hand trajectory annotations, without supervision in the form of action labels. For the evaluation, we establish benchmarks utilizing the first-person FPHAB and HOI4D datasets, testing our method against various baselines and using multiple metrics. We also introduce task simulators for executing the generated hand trajectories and reporting task success rates as an additional metric. Experiments show that our method generates more appropriate and realistic hand trajectories than baselines and presents promising generalization capability on unseen objects. The accuracy of the generated hand trajectories is confirmed in a physics simulation setting, showcasing the authenticity of the created sequences and their applicability in downstream uses.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeGuE: Semantic Guided Exploration for Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03629v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of embodied AI applications has enabled robots to perform complex tasks which require a sophisticated understanding of their environment. To enable successful robot operation in such settings, maps must be constructed so that they include semantic information, in addition to geometric information. In this paper, we address the novel problem of semantic exploration, whereby a mobile robot must autonomously explore an environment to fully map both its structure and the semantic appearance of features. We develop a method based on next-best-view exploration, where potential poses are scored based on the semantic features visible from that pose. We explore two alternative methods for sampling potential views and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulation and physical experiments. Automatic creation of high-quality semantic maps can enable robots to better understand and interact with their environments and enable future embodied AI applications to be more easily deployed.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Decision SpikeFormer: Spike-Driven Transformer for Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03800v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy training solely on pre-collected data, avoiding direct environment interaction - a crucial benefit for energy-constrained embodied AI applications. Although Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)-based methods perform well in offline RL, their high computational and energy demands motivate exploration of more efficient alternatives. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) show promise for such tasks, given their low power consumption. In this work, we introduce DSFormer, the first spike-driven transformer model designed to tackle offline RL via sequence modeling. Unlike existing SNN transformers focused on spatial dimensions for vision tasks, we develop Temporal Spiking Self-Attention (TSSA) and Positional Spiking Self-Attention (PSSA) in DSFormer to capture the temporal and positional dependencies essential for sequence modeling in RL. Additionally, we propose Progressive Threshold-dependent Batch Normalization (PTBN), which combines the benefits of LayerNorm and BatchNorm to preserve temporal dependencies while maintaining the spiking nature of SNNs. Comprehensive results in the D4RL benchmark show DSFormer's superiority over both SNN and ANN counterparts, achieving 78.4% energy savings, highlighting DSFormer's advantages not only in energy efficiency but also in competitive performance. Code and models are public at https://wei-nijuan.github.io/DecisionSpikeFormer.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[3D-Mem: 3D Scene Memory for Embodied Exploration and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17735v5)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing compact and informative 3D scene representations is essential for effective embodied exploration and reasoning, especially in complex environments over extended periods. Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[MORAL: A Multimodal Reinforcement Learning Framework for Decision Making in Autonomous Laboratories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03153v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose MORAL (a multimodal reinforcement learning framework for decision making in autonomous laboratories) that enhances sequential decision-making in autonomous robotic laboratories through the integration of visual and textual inputs. Using the BridgeData V2 dataset, we generate fine-tuned image captions with a pretrained BLIP-2 vision-language model and combine them with visual features through an early fusion strategy. The fused representations are processed using Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agents. Experimental results demonstrate that multimodal agents achieve a 20% improvement in task completion rates and significantly outperform visual-only and textual-only baselines after sufficient training. Compared to transformer-based and recurrent multimodal RL models, our approach achieves superior performance in cumulative reward and caption quality metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L). These results highlight the impact of semantically aligned language cues in enhancing agent learning efficiency and generalization. The proposed framework contributes to the advancement of multimodal reinforcement learning and embodied AI systems in dynamic, real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 14 figures and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[TokenHSI: Unified Synthesis of Physical Human-Scene Interactions through Task Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19901v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing diverse and physically plausible Human-Scene Interactions (HSI) is pivotal for both computer animation and embodied AI. Despite encouraging progress, current methods mainly focus on developing separate controllers, each specialized for a specific interaction task. This significantly hinders the ability to tackle a wide variety of challenging HSI tasks that require the integration of multiple skills, e.g., sitting down while carrying an object. To address this issue, we present TokenHSI, a single, unified transformer-based policy capable of multi-skill unification and flexible adaptation. The key insight is to model the humanoid proprioception as a separate shared token and combine it with distinct task tokens via a masking mechanism. Such a unified policy enables effective knowledge sharing across skills, thereby facilitating the multi-task training. Moreover, our policy architecture supports variable length inputs, enabling flexible adaptation of learned skills to new scenarios. By training additional task tokenizers, we can not only modify the geometries of interaction targets but also coordinate multiple skills to address complex tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve versatility, adaptability, and extensibility in various HSI tasks.

| **[IDMR: Towards Instance-Driven Precise Visual Correspondence in Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00954v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval systems are becoming increasingly vital for cutting-edge AI technologies, such as embodied AI and AI-driven digital content industries. However, current multimodal retrieval tasks lack sufficient complexity and demonstrate limited practical application value. It spires us to design Instance-Driven Multimodal Image Retrieval (IDMR), a novel task that requires models to retrieve images containing the same instance as a query image while matching a text-described scenario. Unlike existing retrieval tasks focused on global image similarity or category-level matching, IDMR demands fine-grained instance-level consistency across diverse contexts. To benchmark this capability, we develop IDMR-bench using real-world object tracking and first-person video data. Addressing the scarcity of training data, we propose a cross-domain synthesis method that creates 557K training samples by cropping objects from standard detection datasets. Our Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based retrieval model, trained on 1.2M samples, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both traditional benchmarks and our zero-shot IDMR-bench. Experimental results demonstrate previous models' limitations in instance-aware retrieval and highlight the potential of MLLM for advanced retrieval applications. The whole training dataset, codes and models, with wide ranges of sizes, are available at https://github.com/BwLiu01/IDMR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Agent Reasoning in Image Schemas: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Embodied Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24110v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in embodied AI, agent reasoning systems still struggle to capture the fundamental conceptual structures that humans naturally use to understand and interact with their environment. To address this, we propose a novel framework that bridges embodied cognition theory and agent systems by leveraging a formal characterization of image schemas, which are defined as recurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. By customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create a neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental conceptual structures. We argue that such an approach enhances both efficiency and interpretability while enabling more intuitive human-agent interactions through shared embodied understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[ManipTrans: Efficient Dexterous Bimanual Manipulation Transfer via Residual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21860v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human hands play a central role in interacting, motivating increasing research in dexterous robotic manipulation. Data-driven embodied AI algorithms demand precise, large-scale, human-like manipulation sequences, which are challenging to obtain with conventional reinforcement learning or real-world teleoperation. To address this, we introduce ManipTrans, a novel two-stage method for efficiently transferring human bimanual skills to dexterous robotic hands in simulation. ManipTrans first pre-trains a generalist trajectory imitator to mimic hand motion, then fine-tunes a specific residual module under interaction constraints, enabling efficient learning and accurate execution of complex bimanual tasks. Experiments show that ManipTrans surpasses state-of-the-art methods in success rate, fidelity, and efficiency. Leveraging ManipTrans, we transfer multiple hand-object datasets to robotic hands, creating DexManipNet, a large-scale dataset featuring previously unexplored tasks like pen capping and bottle unscrewing. DexManipNet comprises 3.3K episodes of robotic manipulation and is easily extensible, facilitating further policy training for dexterous hands and enabling real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Graphs as World Models for Semantic Material-Aware Obstacle Handling in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21232v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to infer the material properties of obstacles limits their decision-making capacity. While AVs rely on sensor systems such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar to detect obstacles, this study suggests combining sensors with a knowledge graph (KG)-based world model to improve AVs' comprehension of physical material qualities. Beyond sensor data, AVs can infer qualities such as malleability, density, and elasticity using a semantic KG that depicts the relationships between obstacles and their attributes. Using the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, we evaluated AV performance with and without KG integration. The findings demonstrate that the KG-based method improves obstacle management, which allows AVs to use material qualities to make better decisions about when to change lanes or apply emergency braking. For example, the KG-integrated AV changed lanes for hard impediments like traffic cones and successfully avoided collisions with flexible items such as plastic bags by passing over them. Compared to the control system, the KG framework demonstrated improved responsiveness to obstacles by resolving conflicting sensor data, causing emergency stops for 13.3% more cases. In addition, our method exhibits a 6.6% higher success rate in lane-changing maneuvers in experimental scenarios, particularly for larger, high-impact obstacles. While we focus particularly on autonomous driving, our work demonstrates the potential of KG-based world models to improve decision-making in embodied AI systems and scale to other domains, including robotics, healthcare, and environmental simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Reasoning Video Segmentation with Just-in-Time Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21056v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning segmentation (RS) aims to identify and segment objects of interest based on implicit text queries. As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI agents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring explicit step-by-step guidance. However, current RS approaches rely heavily on the visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs), leading to several major limitations. First, they struggle with queries that require multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex spatial/temporal relationships. Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which may require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs and may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Finally, being primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they scale poorly to online video data. To address these limitations, we propose an agent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS without LLM fine-tuning. Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time digital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- a LLM plans the construction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using specialist vision models. We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin as "just-in-time" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific information and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating every specialist model. The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin representation to identify target objects. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new comprehensive video reasoning segmentation benchmark comprising 200 videos with 895 implicit text queries. The benchmark spans three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal) with three different reasoning chain complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[DINeMo: Learning Neural Mesh Models with no 3D Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20220v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-level 3D/6D pose estimation is a crucial step towards comprehensive 3D scene understanding, which would enable a broad range of applications in robotics and embodied AI. Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations. Our project page is available at https://analysis-by-synthesis.github.io/DINeMo/.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[DataPlatter: Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the DataPlatter method, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Body Discovery of Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19941v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the pursuit of realizing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the importance of embodied artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly apparent. Following this trend, research integrating robots with AGI has become prominent. As various kinds of embodiments have been designed, adaptability to diverse embodiments will become important to AGI. We introduce a new challenge, termed "Body Discovery of Embodied AI", focusing on tasks of recognizing embodiments and summarizing neural signal functionality. The challenge encompasses the precise definition of an AI body and the intricate task of identifying embodiments in dynamic environments, where conventional approaches often prove inadequate. To address these challenges, we apply causal inference method and evaluate it by developing a simulator tailored for testing algorithms with virtual environments. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical testing, demonstrating their robust performance in various scenarios based on virtual environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation and Understanding in Vision: A Survey and New Outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18016v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal technique in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling access to external, reliable, and up-to-date knowledge sources. In the context of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), RAG has proven invaluable by augmenting model outputs with supplementary, relevant information, thus improving their quality. Recently, the potential of RAG has extended beyond natural language processing, with emerging methods integrating retrieval-augmented strategies into the computer vision (CV) domain. These approaches aim to address the limitations of relying solely on internal model knowledge by incorporating authoritative external knowledge bases, thereby improving both the understanding and generation capabilities of vision models. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV, focusing on two main areas: (I) visual understanding and (II) visual generation. In the realm of visual understanding, we systematically review tasks ranging from basic image recognition to complex applications such as medical report generation and multimodal question answering. For visual content generation, we examine the application of RAG in tasks related to image, video, and 3D generation. Furthermore, we explore recent advancements in RAG for embodied AI, with a particular focus on applications in planning, task execution, multimodal perception, interaction, and specialized domains. Given that the integration of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV is still in its early stages, we also highlight the key limitations of current approaches and propose future research directions to drive the development of this promising area.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[NavCoT: Boosting LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation via Learning Disentangled Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07376v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/NavCoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and tailored 3D scene understanding designs. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZeroHSI: Zero-Shot 4D Human-Scene Interaction by Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18600v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-scene interaction (HSI) generation is crucial for applications in embodied AI, virtual reality, and robotics. Yet, existing methods cannot synthesize interactions in unseen environments such as in-the-wild scenes or reconstructed scenes, as they rely on paired 3D scenes and captured human motion data for training, which are unavailable for unseen environments. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis, eliminating the need for training on any MoCap data. Our key insight is to distill human-scene interactions from state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/ The first two authors contribute equally</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Training of Generalizable Visuomotor Policies via Control-Aware Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09258v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving generalization is one key challenge in embodied AI, where obtaining large-scale datasets across diverse scenarios is costly. Traditional weak augmentations, such as cropping and flipping, are insufficient for improving a model's performance in new environments. Existing data augmentation methods often disrupt task-relevant information in images, potentially degrading performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EAGLE, an efficient training framework for generalizable visuomotor policies that improves upon existing methods by (1) enhancing generalization by applying augmentation only to control-related regions identified through a self-supervised control-aware mask and (2) improving training stability and efficiency by distilling knowledge from an expert to a visuomotor student policy, which is then deployed to unseen environments without further fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on three domains, including the DMControl Generalization Benchmark, the enhanced Robot Manipulation Distraction Benchmark, and a long-sequential drawer-opening task, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[KARMA: Augmenting Embodied AI Agents with Long-and-short Term Memory Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14908v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI agents responsible for executing interconnected, long-sequence household tasks often face difficulties with in-context memory, leading to inefficiencies and errors in task execution. To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KARMA's plug-and-play capability allows for seamless deployment on real-world robotic systems, such as mobile manipulation platforms.Through this plug-and-play memory system, KARMA significantly enhances the ability of embodied agents to generate coherent and contextually appropriate plans, making the execution of complex household tasks more efficient.

| **[3D-GRAND: A Million-Scale Dataset for 3D-LLMs with Better Grounding and Less Hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05132v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of language and 3D perception is crucial for embodied agents and robots that comprehend and interact with the physical world. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities, their adaptation to 3D environments (3D-LLMs) remains in its early stages. A primary challenge is a lack of large-scale datasets with dense grounding between language and 3D scenes. We introduce 3D-GRAND, a pioneering large-scale dataset comprising 40,087 household scenes paired with 6.2 million densely-grounded scene-language instructions. Our results show that instruction tuning with 3D-GRAND significantly enhances grounding capabilities and reduces hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. As part of our contributions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark 3D-POPE to systematically evaluate hallucination in 3D-LLMs, enabling fair comparisons of models. Our experiments highlight a scaling effect between dataset size and 3D-LLM performance, emphasizing the importance of large-scale 3D-text datasets for embodied AI research. Our results demonstrate early signals for effective sim-to-real transfer, indicating that models trained on large synthetic data can perform well on real-world 3D scans. Through 3D-GRAND and 3D-POPE, we aim to equip the embodied AI community with resources and insights to lead to more reliable and better-grounded 3D-LLMs. Project website: https://3d-grand.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under revision at IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

In this paper, we propose SpatialBot for better spatial understanding by feeding both RGB and depth images. Additionally, we have constructed the SpatialQA dataset, which involves multi-level depth-related questions to train VLMs for depth understanding. Finally, we present SpatialBench to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' capabilities in spatial understanding at different levels. Extensive experiments on our spatial-understanding benchmark, general VLM benchmarks and Embodied AI tasks, demonstrate the remarkable improvements of SpatialBot trained on SpatialQA.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MoK-RAG, a novel multi-source RAG framework that implements a mixture of knowledge paths enhanced retrieval mechanism through functional partitioning of a large language model (LLM) corpus into distinct sections, enabling retrieval from multiple specialized knowledge paths. Applied to the generation of 3D simulated environments, our proposed MoK-RAG3D enhances this paradigm by partitioning 3D assets into distinct sections and organizing them based on a hierarchical knowledge tree structure. Different from previous methods that only use manual evaluation, we pioneered the introduction of automated evaluation methods for 3D scenes. Both automatic and human evaluations in our experiments demonstrate that MoK-RAG3D can assist Embodied AI agents in generating diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods for creating articulated objects are either data-driven or simulation based, which are limited by the scale and quality of the training data or the fidelity and heavy labour of the simulation. In this paper, we propose Infinite Mobility, a novel method for synthesizing high-fidelity articulated objects through procedural generation. User study and quantitative evaluation demonstrate that our method can produce results that excel current state-of-the-art methods and are comparable to human-annotated datasets in both physics property and mesh quality. Furthermore, we show that our synthetic data can be used as training data for generative models, enabling next-step scaling up.

| **[Exploring 3D Activity Reasoning and Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D activity reasoning and planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advance in multimodal learning. However, most existing works share two constraints: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. To bridge the gaps, we propose 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans, and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control.

We introduce the static to openable (S2O) task which creates interactive articulated 3D objects from static counterparts through openable part detection, motion prediction, and interior geometry completion. We formulate a unified framework to tackle this task, and curate a challenging dataset of openable 3D objects that serves as a test bed for systematic evaluation. Our experiments benchmark methods from prior work, extended and improved methods, and simple yet effective heuristics for the S2O task. We find that turning static 3D objects into interactively openable counterparts is possible but that all methods struggle to generalize to realistic settings of the task, and we highlight promising future work directions. Our work enables efficient creation of interactive 3D objects for robotic manipulation and embodied AI tasks.</p></details> |  |

Many navigation approaches primarily define success by proximity to the target, often overlooking the necessity for optimal positioning that facilitates subsequent manipulation. To address this, we introduce MoMa-Kitchen, a benchmark dataset comprising over 100k samples that provide training data for models to learn optimal final navigation positions for seamless transition to manipulation. Our dataset includes affordance-grounded floor labels collected from diverse kitchen environments, in which robotic mobile manipulators of different models attempt to grasp target objects amidst clutter. Using a fully automated pipeline, we simulate diverse real-world scenarios and generate affordance labels for optimal manipulation positions. Visual data are collected from RGB-D inputs captured by a first-person view camera mounted on the robotic arm, ensuring consistency in viewpoint during data collection. We also develop a lightweight baseline model, NavAff, for navigation affordance grounding that demonstrates promising performance on the MoMa-Kitchen benchmark. Our approach enables models to learn affordance-based final positioning that accommodates different arm types and platform heights, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable integration of navigation and manipulation in embodied AI.

Recognizing continuous video activities poses considerable challenges due to the fast expansion of streaming video, which contains multi-scale and untrimmed activities. We introduce a novel system, CARS, to overcome these issues through adaptive video context modeling. Adaptive video context modeling refers to selectively maintaining activity-related features in temporal and spatial dimensions. CARS has two key designs. The first is an activity spatial feature extraction by eliminating irrelevant visual features while maintaining recognition accuracy. The second is an activity-aware state update introducing dynamic adaptability to better preserve the video context for multi-scale activity recognition. Our CARS runs at speeds $>$30 FPS on typical edge devices and outperforms all baselines by 1.2\% to 79.7\% in accuracy. Moreover, we explore applying CARS to a large video model as a video encoder. Experimental results show that our CARS can result in a 0.46-point enhancement (on a 5-point scale) on the in-distribution video activity dataset, and an improvement ranging from 1.19\% to 4\% on zero-shot video activity datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Long-horizon Embodied Planning with Implicit Logical Inference and Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15658v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon embodied planning underpins embodied AI. To accomplish long-horizon tasks, one of the most feasible ways is to decompose abstract instructions into a sequence of actionable steps. Foundation models still face logical errors and hallucinations in long-horizon planning, unless provided with highly relevant examples to the tasks. However, providing highly relevant examples for any random task is unpractical. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a novel framework for Real-time Long-horizon Embodied Planning. ReLEP can complete a wide range of long-horizon tasks without in-context examples by learning implicit logical inference through fine-tuning. The fine-tuned large vision-language model formulates plans as sequences of skill functions. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. When constructing the dataset, we considered the implicit logical relationships, enabling the model to learn implicit logical relationships and dispel hallucinations. Through comprehensive evaluations across various long-horizon tasks, ReLEP demonstrates high success rates and compliance to execution even on unseen tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

The high cost of commercial mobile manipulation robots significantly limits research in real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose AhaRobot, a low-cost and fully open-source dual-arm mobile manipulation robot system with a hardware cost of only $1,000 (excluding optional computational resources), which is less than 1/15 of the cost of popular mobile robots. The AhaRobot system consists of three components: (1) a novel low-cost hardware architecture primarily composed of off-the-shelf components, (2) an optimized control solution to enhance operational precision integrating dual-motor backlash control and static friction compensation, and (3) a simple remote teleoperation method RoboPilot. We use handles to control the dual arms and pedals for whole-body movement. The teleoperation process is low-burden and easy to operate, much like piloting. RoboPilot is designed for remote data collection in embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboPilot significantly enhances data collection efficiency in complex manipulation tasks, achieving a 30% increase compared to methods using 3D mouse and leader-follower systems. It also excels at completing extremely long-horizon tasks in one go. Furthermore, AhaRobot can be used to learn end-to-end policies and autonomously perform complex manipulation tasks, such as pen insertion and cleaning up the floor. We aim to build an affordable yet powerful platform to promote the development of embodied tasks on real devices, advancing more robust and reliable embodied AI.

Current screen based chat-bots do not take advantage of the the full-suite of natural inputs available in XR, including inward facing sensor data, instead they over-rely on explicit voice or text prompts, sometimes paired with multi-modal data dropped as part of the query.

Our work minimizes the need for engineered explicit prompts, fostering grounded and intuitive interactions that glean user insights for the chat-bot.</p></details> |  |

The system leverages multiple RGBD cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |

Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks. To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Interactive systems assist humans in these tasks, enabling applications in Embodied AI, human-robot interaction, and virtual reality. However, current methods in hand-object synthesis often neglect dynamics and focus on generating static grasps. The first part of this dissertation introduces dynamic grasp synthesis, where a hand grasps and moves an object to a target pose. We approach this task using physical simulation and reinforcement learning. We then extend this to bimanual manipulation and articulated objects, requiring fine-grained coordination between hands. In the second part of this dissertation, we study human-to-robot handovers. We integrate captured human motion into simulation and introduce a student-teacher framework that adapts to human behavior and transfers from sim to real. To overcome data scarcity, we generate synthetic interactions, increasing training diversity by 100x. Our user study finds no difference between policies trained on synthetic vs. real motions.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |

However, real-world datasets often lack sufficient data for training and evaluation, and synthetic datasets, while larger, lack acoustic realism. Consequently, neither effectively meets practical needs. To address this issue, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit based on the embodied AI simulation platform Habitat-sim, designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim supports multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level adjustments, enabling the creation of more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a benchmark dataset called SonicSet, utilizing LibriSpeech, Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K), Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to investigate the differences between synthetic and real-world data, we selected 5 hours of raw, non-reverberant data from the SonicSet validation set and recorded a real-world speech separation dataset, providing a reference for comparing SonicSet with other synthetic datasets. For speech enhancement, we utilized the real-world dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between SonicSet and existing synthetic datasets. The results indicate that models trained on SonicSet generalize better to real-world scenarios compared to other synthetic datasets.

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI.

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization.

Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development.

Affordance indicates where and how to grasp an object by taking its functionality into account, serving as the foundation for effective task-oriented grasping. However, current task-oriented methods often depend on extensive training data that is confined to specific tasks and objects, making it difficult to generalize to novel objects and complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce AffordGrasp, a novel open-vocabulary grasping framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) for in-context affordance reasoning. Unlike existing methods that rely on explicit task and object specifications, our approach infers tasks directly from implicit user instructions, enabling more intuitive and seamless human-robot interaction in everyday scenarios. Building on the reasoning outcomes, our framework identifies task-relevant objects and grounds their part-level affordances using a visual grounding module. This allows us to generate task-oriented grasp poses precisely within the affordance regions of the object, ensuring both functional and context-aware robotic manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. We believe our approach advances robotic manipulation techniques and contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://eqcy.github.io/affordgrasp/.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of prior magical grasp implementations at a fraction of the GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |

These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Pattern Recognition Letters.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, when powered by open LLMs, they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a multicomponent memory system. In Minecraft experiments, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks where traditional Voyager fails without GPT-4, collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items and achieving $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones, advancing from basic wood tools to advanced iron equipment. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated collaborative experiences. MindForge advances the democratization of embodied AI development through open-ended social learning, enabling peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.</p></details> |  |

Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |

Recent advances in foundation models pave the way for generative agents capable of richer communication and adaptive problem-solving. This survey provides a systematic examination of how EMAS can benefit from these generative capabilities. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes EMAS by system architectures and embodiment modalities, emphasizing how collaboration spans both physical and virtual contexts. Central building blocks, perception, planning, communication, and feedback, are then analyzed to illustrate how generative techniques bolster system robustness and flexibility. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the transformative effects of integrating foundation models into embodied, multi-agent frameworks. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions, underlining the significant promise of EMAS to reshape the landscape of AI-driven collaboration.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We propose a novel object-centric latent action learning approach, based on VideoSaur and LAPO, that employs self-supervised decomposition of scenes into object representations and annotates video data with proxy-action labels. This method effectively disentangles causal agent-object interactions from irrelevant background noise and reduces the performance degradation of latent action learning approaches caused by distractors. Our preliminary experiments with the Distracting Control Suite show that latent action pretraining based on object decompositions improve the quality of inferred latent actions by x2.7 and efficiency of downstream fine-tuning with a small set of labeled actions, increasing return by x2.6 on average.</p></details> | Preprint.

However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |

Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets.

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |

This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

However, existing block propagation mechanisms suffer from challenges such as low propagation efficiency and weak security for block propagation, which results in delayed transmission of vehicular messages or vulnerability to malicious tampering, potentially causing severe traffic accidents in blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Moreover, current block propagation strategies cannot effectively adapt to real-time changes of dynamic topology in MEANETs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph Resfusion model-based trustworthy block propagation optimization framework for consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Specifically, we propose an innovative trust calculation mechanism based on the trust cloud model, which comprehensively accounts for randomness and fuzziness in the miner trust evaluation. Furthermore, by leveraging the strengths of graph neural networks and diffusion models, we develop a graph Resfusion model to effectively and adaptively generate the optimal block propagation trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other routing mechanisms in terms of block propagation efficiency and trustworthiness. Additionally, the results highlight its strong adaptability to dynamic environments, making it particularly suitable for rapidly changing MEANETs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</p></details> | Website: GenEx.world |

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

However, a standardized, closed-loop benchmark for evaluating their spatial reasoning and sequential decision-making capabilities is lacking. To address this, we present MetaVQA: a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess and enhance VLMs' understanding of spatial relationships and scene dynamics through Visual Question Answering (VQA) and closed-loop simulations. MetaVQA leverages Set-of-Mark prompting and top-down view ground-truth annotations from nuScenes and Waymo datasets to automatically generate extensive question-answer pairs based on diverse real-world traffic scenarios, ensuring object-centric and context-rich instructions. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with the MetaVQA dataset significantly improves their spatial reasoning and embodied scene comprehension in safety-critical simulations, evident not only in improved VQA accuracies but also in emerging safety-aware driving maneuvers. In addition, the learning demonstrates strong transferability from simulation to real-world observation.

However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks. This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context. Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior studies that explored this as long-form video understanding and utilized egocentric video only, we instead propose an LLM-based agent, Embodied VideoAgent, which constructs scene memory from both egocentric video and embodied sensory inputs (e.g. depth and pose sensing). We further introduce a VLM-based approach to automatically update the memory when actions or activities over objects are perceived. Embodied VideoAgent attains significant advantages over counterparts in challenging reasoning and planning tasks in 3D scenes, achieving gains of 4.9% on Ego4D-VQ3D, 5.8% on OpenEQA, and 11.7% on EnvQA.

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |

The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment.

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV.

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</p></details> |  |

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments.

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |

However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions.

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint.

Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While promising, our initial experiments reveal that incorporating a thinking process through RL does not consistently lead to performance gains across all visual perception tasks. This leads us to delve into the essential role of RL in the context of visual perception. In this work, we return to the fundamentals and explore the effects of RL on different perception tasks. We observe that the perceptual complexity is a major factor in determining the effectiveness of RL. We also observe that reward design plays a crucial role in further approching the upper limit of model perception. To leverage these findings, we propose Perception-R1, a scalable RL framework using GRPO during MLLM post-training. With a standard Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, Perception-R1 achieves +4.2% on RefCOCO+, +17.9% on PixMo-Count, +4.2% on PageOCR, and notably, 31.9% AP on COCO2017 val for the first time, establishing a strong baseline for perception policy learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github page: https://github.com/linkangheng/PR1</p></details> |
| **[Echo Chamber: RL Post-training Amplifies Behaviors Learned in Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07912v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has become a crucial step in post-training language models for advanced mathematical reasoning and coding. Following the success of frontier reasoning models, recent work has demonstrated that RL fine-tuning consistently improves performance, even in smaller-scale models; however, the underlying mechanisms driving these improvements are not well-understood. Understanding the effects of RL fine-tuning requires disentangling its interaction with pretraining data composition, hyperparameters, and model scale, but such problems are exacerbated by the lack of transparency regarding the training data used in many existing models. In this work, we present a systematic end-to-end study of RL fine-tuning for mathematical reasoning by training models entirely from scratch on different mixtures of fully open datasets. We investigate the effects of various RL fine-tuning algorithms (PPO, GRPO, and Expert Iteration) across models of different scales. Our study reveals that RL algorithms consistently converge towards a dominant output distribution, amplifying patterns in the pretraining data. We also find that models of different scales trained on the same data mixture will converge to distinct output distributions, suggesting that there are scale-dependent biases in model generalization. Moreover, we find that RL post-training on simpler questions can lead to performance gains on harder ones, indicating that certain reasoning capabilities generalize across tasks. Our findings show that small-scale proxies in controlled settings can elicit interesting insights regarding the role of RL in shaping language model behavior.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

We propose a training method which avoids agents learning undesired multi-step plans that receive high reward (multi-step "reward hacks") even if humans are not able to detect that the behaviour is undesired. The method, Myopic Optimization with Non-myopic Approval (MONA), works by combining short-sighted optimization with far-sighted reward. We demonstrate that MONA can prevent multi-step reward hacking that ordinary RL causes, even without being able to detect the reward hacking and without any extra information that ordinary RL does not get access to. We study MONA empirically in three settings which model different misalignment failure modes including 2-step environments with LLMs representing delegated oversight and encoded reasoning and longer-horizon gridworld environments representing sensor tampering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Adaptation with Behavioral Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07896v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining behavioral foundation models (BFMs), enabling agents to solve a wide range of downstream tasks specified via reward functions in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without additional test-time learning or planning. This is achieved by learning self-supervised task embeddings alongside corresponding near-optimal behaviors and incorporating an inference procedure to directly retrieve the latent task embedding and associated policy for any given reward function. Despite promising results, zero-shot policies are often suboptimal due to errors induced by the unsupervised training process, the embedding, and the inference procedure. In this paper, we focus on devising fast adaptation strategies to improve the zero-shot performance of BFMs in a few steps of online interaction with the environment while avoiding any performance drop during the adaptation process. Notably, we demonstrate that existing BFMs learn a set of skills containing more performant policies than those identified by their inference procedure, making them well-suited for fast adaptation. Motivated by this observation, we propose both actor-critic and actor-only fast adaptation strategies that search in the low-dimensional task-embedding space of the pre-trained BFM to rapidly improve the performance of its zero-shot policies on any downstream task. Notably, our approach mitigates the initial "unlearning" phase commonly observed when fine-tuning pre-trained RL models. We evaluate our fast adaptation strategies on top of four state-of-the-art zero-shot RL methods in multiple navigation and locomotion domains. Our results show that they achieve 10-40% improvement over their zero-shot performance in a few tens of episodes, outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> | 25 pages |

While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers an efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback, traditional DPO methods are limited by their reliance on single preference pairs. Recent work like Curriculum-DPO integrates multiple pairs using a one-dimensional difficulty curriculum based on pairwise distinguishability (PD), but overlooks the complexity of the input prompt itself. To address this, we propose 2D-Curri-DPO, a novel framework employing a two-dimensional curriculum that jointly models Prompt Complexity (PC) and Pairwise Distinguishability. This framework introduces dual difficulty metrics to quantify prompt semantic complexity and response preference clarity, defines a curriculum strategy space encompassing multiple selectable strategies for task adaptation, and incorporates a KL-divergence-based adaptive mechanism for dynamic reference model updates to enhance training stability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that 2D-Curri-DPO significantly outperforms standard DPO and prior curriculum methods across multiple benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Vicuna Bench, and WizardLM. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging test sets like UltraFeedback. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of the 2D structure and adaptive mechanisms, while analysis provides guidance for strategy selection. These findings demonstrate that effective alignment requires modeling both prompt complexity and pairwise distinguishability, establishing adaptive, multi-dimensional curriculum learning as a powerful and interpretable new paradigm for preference-based language model optimization.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

This paper introduces an innovative approach that combines Genetic Programming (GP) with a Transformer trained through Reinforcement Learning (GPRT), specifically designed to tackle the complexities of dynamic scheduling scenarios. GPRT leverages the Transformer to refine heuristics generated by GP while also seeding and guiding the evolution of GP. This dual functionality enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of the scheduling heuristics, enabling them to better respond to the dynamic nature of real-world tasks. The efficacy of this integrated approach is demonstrated through a practical application in container terminal truck scheduling, where the GPRT method outperforms traditional GP, standalone Transformer methods, and other state-of-the-art competitors. The key contribution of this research is the development of the GPRT method, which showcases a novel combination of GP and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce robust and efficient scheduling solutions. Importantly, GPRT is not limited to container port truck scheduling; it offers a versatile framework applicable to various dynamic scheduling challenges. Its practicality, coupled with its interpretability and ease of modification, makes it a valuable tool for diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In addition, suitable invariant input and output spaces are derived that allow the GNN models to be embedded seamlessly into the LES framework to obtain a symmetry-preserving simulation setup. The suitability of the proposed approach is investigated for two canonical test cases: Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (HIT) and turbulent channel flow. For both cases, GNN models are trained successfully in actual simulations using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to ensure that the models are consistent with the underlying LES formulation and discretization. It is demonstrated for the HIT case that the resulting GNN-based LES scheme recovers rotational and reflectional equivariance up to machine precision in actual simulations. At the same time, the stability and accuracy remain on par with non-symmetry-preserving machine learning models that fail to obey these properties. The same modeling strategy translates well to turbulent channel flow, where the GNN model successfully learns the more complex flow physics and is able to recover the turbulent statistics and Reynolds stresses. It is shown that the GNN model learns a zonal modeling strategy with distinct behaviors in the near-wall and outer regions. The proposed approach thus demonstrates the potential of GNNs for turbulence modeling, especially in the context of LES and RL.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

This theoretical result relaxes the Markov assumption on the stochastic process underlying conventional $Q$-learning, deploying a generalized form of the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation theorem to establish optimality. This result has clear downstream implications for most active subfields of Reinforcement Learning, with clear paths for extension to the field of Causal Inference.</p></details> |  |

Variable-pitch propeller (VPP) MAVs offer greater agility, yet their complex dynamics complicate the sim-to-real transfer. This paper introduces a novel RL framework to overcome these challenges, enabling VPP MAVs to perform advanced aerial maneuvers in real-world settings. Our approach includes real-to-sim transfer techniques-such as system identification, domain randomization, and curriculum learning to create robust training simulations and a sim-to-real transfer strategy combining a cascade control system with a fast-response low-level controller for reliable deployment. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in achieving zero-shot deployment, enabling MAVs to perform complex maneuvers such as flips and wall-backtracking.</p></details> |  |

Most RL agents exhibit a limited capacity to generalize, often focusing narrowly on specific scenarios, and are usually evaluated in similar or even the same scenarios seen during training. Various methods have been proposed to address these challenges, including experience replay and regularization. However, how observation design in RL affects sample efficiency and generalization remains an under-explored area. We address this gap by proposing five strategies to design information-dense observations, focusing on general features that are applicable to most traffic scenarios. We train our RL agents using these strategies on an intersection and evaluate their generalization through numerical experiments across completely unseen traffic scenarios, including a new intersection, an on-ramp, and a roundabout. Incorporating these information-dense observations reduces training times to under one hour on a single CPU, and the evaluation results reveal that our RL agents can effectively zero-shot generalize.

However, learning a robust world model often requires complex and deep architectures, which are computationally expensive and challenging to train. Within the world model, sequence models play a critical role in accurate predictions, and various architectures have been explored, each with its own challenges. Currently, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based world models struggle with vanishing gradients and capturing long-term dependencies. Transformers, on the other hand, suffer from the quadratic memory and computational complexity of self-attention mechanisms, scaling as $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the sequence length. To address these challenges, we propose a state space model (SSM)-based world model, Drama, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves $O(n)$ memory and computational complexity while effectively capturing long-term dependencies and enabling efficient training with longer sequences. We also introduce a novel sampling method to mitigate the suboptimality caused by an incorrect world model in the early training stages. Combining these techniques, Drama achieves a normalised score on the Atari100k benchmark that is competitive with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) model-based RL algorithms, using only a 7 million-parameter world model. Drama is accessible and trainable on off-the-shelf hardware, such as a standard laptop.

Tasks such as insertion with different objects or cloth hanging require precise control and effective modelling of complex dynamics. In this work, we frame this problem through the lens of a heterogeneous graph that comprises smaller sub-graphs, such as actuators and objects, accompanied by different edge types describing their interactions. This graph representation serves as a unified structure for both rigid and deformable objects tasks, and can be extended further to tasks comprising multiple actuators. To evaluate this setup, we present a novel and challenging reinforcement learning benchmark, including rigid insertion of diverse objects, as well as rope and cloth manipulation with multiple end-effectors. These tasks present a large search space, as both the initial and target configurations are uniformly sampled in 3D space. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph-based policy model, dubbed Heterogeneous Equivariant Policy (HEPi), utilizing $SE(3)$ equivariant message passing networks as the main backbone to exploit the geometric symmetry. In addition, by modeling explicit heterogeneity, HEPi can outperform Transformer-based and non-heterogeneous equivariant policies in terms of average returns, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen objects.

Existing conceptual models for visual and multimedia analytics, however, do not adequately capture the complexity introduced by these powerful AI paradigms. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive multimedia analytics model specifically designed for the foundation model era. Building upon established frameworks from visual analytics, multimedia analytics, knowledge generation, analytic task definition, mixed-initiative guidance, and human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning, our model emphasizes integrated human-AI teaming based on visual analytics agents from both technical and conceptual perspectives. Central to the model is a seamless, yet explicitly separable, interaction channel between expert users and semi-autonomous analytical processes, ensuring continuous alignment between user intent and AI behavior. The model addresses practical challenges in sensitive domains such as intelligence analysis, investigative journalism, and other fields handling complex, high-stakes data. We illustrate through detailed case studies how our model facilitates deeper understanding and targeted improvement of multimedia analytics solutions. By explicitly capturing how expert users can optimally interact with and guide AI-powered multimedia analytics systems, our conceptual framework sets a clear direction for system design, comparison, and future research.</p></details> |  |

The core of R1 lies in its rule-based reward formulation, which leverages tasks with deterministic ground-truth answers to enable precise and stable reward computation. In the visual domain, we similarly observe that a wide range of visual understanding tasks are inherently equipped with well-defined ground-truth annotations. This property makes them naturally compatible with rule-based reward mechanisms. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the extension of R1-style reinforcement learning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their visual reasoning capabilities. To this end, we develop VLM-R1, a dedicated framework designed to harness RL for improving VLMs' performance on general vision-language tasks. Using this framework, we further explore the feasibility of applying RL to visual domain. Experimental results indicate that the RL-based model not only delivers competitive performance on visual understanding tasks but also surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in generalization ability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies that uncover a series of noteworthy insights, including the presence of reward hacking in object detection, the emergence of the "OD aha moment", the impact of training data quality, and the scaling behavior of RL across different model sizes. Through these analyses, we aim to deepen the understanding of how reinforcement learning enhances the capabilities of vision-language models, and we hope our findings and open-source contributions will support continued progress in the vision-language RL community.

By engaging in dialogues with RL agents, LLMs construct a Reward Observation Space (ROS) by selecting relevant environment states and defining their internal operations. However, existing frameworks have not effectively leveraged historical exploration data or manual task descriptions to iteratively evolve this space. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic framework that enhances LLM-driven reward design by evolving the ROS through a table-based exploration caching mechanism and a text-code reconciliation strategy. Our framework introduces a state execution table, which tracks the historical usage and success rates of environment states, overcoming the Markovian constraint typically found in LLM dialogues and facilitating more effective exploration. Furthermore, we reconcile user-provided task descriptions with expert-defined success criteria using structured prompts, ensuring alignment in reward design objectives. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark RL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed framework.

Transformers are based on the long standing conception of integrate-and-fire 'point' neurons, whereas Cooperator is inspired by recent neurobiological breakthroughs suggesting that the cellular foundations of mental life depend on context-sensitive pyramidal neurons in the neocortex which have two functionally distinct points. Weshow that when used for RL, an algorithm based on Cooperator learns far quicker than that based on Transformer, even while having the same number of parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Subspaces of Policies for Continual Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14865v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a Continual Reinforcement Learning setup, where a learning agent must continuously adapt to new tasks while retaining previously acquired skill sets, with a focus on the challenge of avoiding forgetting past gathered knowledge and ensuring scalability with the growing number of tasks. Such issues prevail in autonomous robotics and video game simulations, notably for navigation tasks prone to topological or kinematic changes. To address these issues, we introduce HiSPO, a novel hierarchical framework designed specifically for continual learning in navigation settings from offline data. Our method leverages distinct policy subspaces of neural networks to enable flexible and efficient adaptation to new tasks while preserving existing knowledge. We demonstrate, through a careful experimental study, the effectiveness of our method in both classical MuJoCo maze environments and complex video game-like navigation simulations, showcasing competitive performances and satisfying adaptability with respect to classical continual learning metrics, in particular regarding the memory usage and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Given the practical challenges of obtaining accurate models, Q-function-based policy iteration methods are proposed to seek the Nash equilibrium solution for the cooperative graphical game and the distributed minmax solution for the non-cooperative graphical game. To implement these methods online, two reinforcement learning frameworks are developed, an actor-disturber-critic structure for the cooperative graphical game and an actor-adversary-disturber-critic structure for the non-cooperative graphical game. The stability of the proposed methods is rigorously analyzed, and simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

Addressing these challenges necessitates innovative service orchestration methods capable of seamless integration across the edge-cloud continuum. Terrestrial network-based service orchestration methods struggle to deliver timely responses to growing traffic demands or support users with poor or lack of access to terrestrial infrastructure. Exploiting both aerial and terrestrial resources in service composition increases coverage and facilitates the use of full computing and communication potentials. This paper proposes a service placement and composition mechanism for integrated aerial-terrestrial networks over the edge-cloud continuum while considering the dynamic nature of the network. The service function placement and service orchestration are modeled in an optimization framework. Considering the dynamicity, the Aerial Base Station (ABS) trajectory might not be deterministic, and their mobility pattern might not be known as assumed knowledge. Also, service requests can traverse through access nodes due to users' mobility. By incorporating predictive algorithms, including Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches, the proposed method predicts ABS locations and service requests. Subsequently, a heuristic isomorphic graph matching approach is proposed to enable efficient, latency-aware service orchestration. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed prediction and service composition schemes in terms of accuracy, cost optimization, scalability, and responsiveness, ensuring timely and reliable service delivery under diverse network conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |

Through this theoretical lens, we demonstrate that the widely used beam search method suffers from unacceptable over-optimism, where inference errors are inevitably amplified due to inflated $Q$-value estimations of suboptimal steps. To address this limitation, we propose Supervised Optimism Correction(SOC), which introduces a simple yet effective auxiliary loss for token-level $Q$-value estimations during supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, the auxiliary loss employs implicit value regularization to boost model confidence in expert-demonstrated responses, thereby suppressing over-optimism toward insufficiently supervised responses. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH, and GAOKAO, showcase the superiority of the proposed SOC with beam search across a series of open-source models.</p></details> |  |

Through simulations of the perceptual crossing paradigm, we explore the effect of various internal reward functions in reinforcement learning agents. The drive to understand is implemented as an active inference type artificial curiosity reward, whereas the drive to be understood is implemented through intrinsic rewards for imitation, influence/impressionability, and sub-reaction time anticipation of the other. Results indicate that while artificial curiosity alone does not lead to a preference for social interaction, rewards emphasizing reciprocal understanding successfully drive agents to prioritize interaction. We demonstrate that this intrinsic motivation can facilitate cooperation in tasks where only one agent receives extrinsic reward for the behaviour of the other.</p></details> |  |

Kimi-VL demonstrates strong performance across challenging domains: as a general-purpose VLM, Kimi-VL excels in multi-turn agent tasks (e.g., OSWorld), matching flagship models. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable capabilities across diverse challenging vision language tasks, including college-level image and video comprehension, OCR, mathematical reasoning, and multi-image understanding.

| **[Robust Event-Triggered Integrated Communication and Control with Graph Information Bottleneck Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09846v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrated communication and control serves as a critical ingredient in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. However, partial observability limitations will impair collaboration effectiveness, and a potential solution is to establish consensus through well-calibrated latent variables obtained from neighboring agents. Nevertheless, the rigid transmission of less informative content can still result in redundant information exchanges. Therefore, we propose a Consensus-Driven Event-Based Graph Information Bottleneck (CDE-GIB) method, which integrates the communication graph and information flow through a GIB regularizer to extract more concise message representations while avoiding the high computational complexity of inner-loop operations. To further minimize the communication volume required for establishing consensus during interactions, we also develop a variable-threshold event-triggering mechanism. By simultaneously considering historical data and current observations, this mechanism capably evaluates the importance of information to determine whether an event should be triggered. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

However, few studies on fighting game agents have focused explicitly on enhancing player enjoyment, a critical factor for both developers and players. To address this gap and establish a practical baseline for designing enjoyability-focused agents, we propose a two-tier agent (TTA) system and conducted experiments in the classic fighting game Street Fighter II. The first tier of TTA employs a task-oriented network architecture, modularized reward functions, and hybrid training to produce diverse and skilled DRL agents. In the second tier of TTA, a Large Language Model Hyper-Agent, leveraging players' playing data and feedback, dynamically selects suitable DRL opponents. In addition, we investigate and model several key factors that affect the enjoyability of the opponent. The experiments demonstrate improvements from 64. 36% to 156. 36% in the execution of advanced skills over baseline methods. The trained agents also exhibit distinct game-playing styles. Additionally, we conducted a small-scale user study, and the overall enjoyment in the player's feedback validates the effectiveness of our TTA system.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures.

| **[State Estimation Using Particle Filtering in Adaptive Machine Learning Methods: Integrating Q-Learning and NEAT Algorithms with Noisy Radar Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07393v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable state estimation is essential for autonomous systems operating in complex, noisy environments. Classical filtering approaches, such as the Kalman filter, can struggle when facing nonlinear dynamics or non-Gaussian noise, and even more flexible particle filters often encounter sample degeneracy or high computational costs in large-scale domains. Meanwhile, adaptive machine learning techniques, including Q-learning and neuroevolutionary algorithms such as NEAT, rely heavily on accurate state feedback to guide learning; when sensor data are imperfect, these methods suffer from degraded convergence and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an integrated framework that unifies particle filtering with Q-learning and NEAT to explicitly address the challenge of noisy measurements. By refining radar-based observations into reliable state estimates, our particle filter drives more stable policy updates (in Q-learning) or controller evolution (in NEAT), allowing both reinforcement learning and neuroevolution to converge faster, achieve higher returns or fitness, and exhibit greater resilience to sensor uncertainty. Experiments on grid-based navigation and a simulated car environment highlight consistent gains in training stability, final performance, and success rates over baselines lacking advanced filtering. Altogether, these findings underscore that accurate state estimation is not merely a preprocessing step, but a vital component capable of substantially enhancing adaptive machine learning in real-world applications plagued by sensor noise.</p></details> |  |

These problems can be formulated as MIP models which feature both integer (non-binary) and continuous variables, as well as flow balance and capacity constraints. This raises fundamental challenges for existing integrations of ML and optimization that have focused on binary MIPs and graph problems. To address these, the paper proposes PROPEL, a new framework that combines optimization with both supervised and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to reduce the size of search space significantly. PROPEL uses supervised learning, not to predict the values of all integer variables, but to identify the variables that are fixed to zero in the optimal solution, leveraging the structure of SCP applications. PROPEL includes a DRL component that selects which fixed-at-zero variables must be relaxed to improve solution quality when the supervised learning step does not produce a solution with the desired optimality tolerance. PROPEL has been applied to industrial supply chain planning optimizations with millions of variables. The computational results show dramatic improvements in solution times and quality, including a 60% reduction in primal integral and an 88% primal gap reduction, and improvement factors of up to 13.57 and 15.92, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Many QMIX-based methods introduce monotonicity constraints between the joint action value and individual action values to achieve decentralized execution. However, such constraints limit the representation capacity of value factorization, restricting the joint action values it can represent and hindering the learning of the optimal policy. To address this challenge, we propose the Potentially Optimal Joint Actions Weighted QMIX (POWQMIX) algorithm, which recognizes the potentially optimal joint actions and assigns higher weights to the corresponding losses of these joint actions during training. We theoretically prove that with such a weighted training approach the optimal policy is guaranteed to be recovered. Experiments in matrix games, difficulty-enhanced predator-prey, and StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge environments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper needs further refinement</p></details> |

However, training CoT capabilities requires detailed reasoning data, which is often scarce. The self-taught reasoner (STaR) framework addresses this by using reinforcement learning to automatically generate reasoning steps, reducing reliance on human-labeled data. Although STaR and its variants have demonstrated empirical success, a theoretical foundation explaining these improvements is lacking. This work provides a theoretical framework for understanding the effectiveness of reinforcement learning on CoT reasoning and STaR. Our contributions are: (1) criteria for the quality of pre-trained models necessary to initiate effective reasoning improvement; (2) an analysis of policy improvement, showing why LLM reasoning improves iteratively with STaR; (3) conditions for convergence to an optimal reasoning policy; and (4) an examination of STaR's robustness, explaining how it can improve reasoning even when incorporating occasional incorrect steps; This framework aims to bridge empirical findings with theoretical insights, advancing reinforcement learning approaches for reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

As a step toward studying such nonlinear systems, this work explores reinforcement learning methods for finding the optimal policy in the nearly linear-quadratic regulator systems. In particular, we consider a dynamic system that combines linear and nonlinear components, and is governed by a policy with the same structure. Assuming that the nonlinear component comprises kernels with small Lipschitz coefficients, we characterize the optimization landscape of the cost function. Although the cost function is nonconvex in general, we establish the local strong convexity and smoothness in the vicinity of the global optimizer. Additionally, we propose an initialization mechanism to leverage these properties. Building on the developments, we design a policy gradient algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to the globally optimal policy with a linear rate.</p></details> | 34 pages |

Unfortunately, most existing meta learning approaches treat different source tasks equally, ignoring the relatedness of source tasks to the target task in knowledge transfer. To mitigate this issue, we propose a reinforcement-based multi-source meta-transfer learning framework (Meta-RTL) for low-resource commonsense reasoning. In this framework, we present a reinforcement-based approach to dynamically estimating source task weights that measure the contribution of the corresponding tasks to the target task in the meta-transfer learning. The differences between the general loss of the meta model and task-specific losses of source-specific temporal meta models on sampled target data are fed into the policy network of the reinforcement learning module as rewards. The policy network is built upon LSTMs that capture long-term dependencies on source task weight estimation across meta learning iterations. We evaluate the proposed Meta-RTL using both BERT and ALBERT as the backbone of the meta model on three commonsense reasoning benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta-RTL substantially outperforms strong baselines and previous task selection strategies and achieves larger improvements on extremely low-resource settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There is a text error in table 6</p></details> |

However, in real-world navigation tasks, DRL methods often suffer from insufficient exploration, particularly in cluttered environments with sparse rewards or complex dynamics under system disturbances. To address this challenge, we bridge general graph-based motion planning with DRL, enabling agents to explore cluttered spaces more effectively and achieve desired navigation performance. Specifically, we design a dense reward function grounded in a graph structure that spans the entire state space. This graph provides rich guidance, steering the agent toward optimal strategies. We validate our approach in challenging environments, demonstrating substantial improvements in exploration efficiency and task success rates.

However, as tasks grow more complex, NNs often require large numbers of trainable parameters, which increases computational and energy demands. Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) offer a promising alternative: they leverage quantum mechanics to capture intricate relationships and typically need fewer parameters. In this work, we evaluate NNs and VQCs on simple supervised and reinforcement learning tasks, examining models with different parameter sizes. We simulate VQCs and execute selected parts of the training process on real quantum hardware to approximate actual training times. Our results show that VQCs can match NNs in performance while using significantly fewer parameters, despite longer training durations. As quantum technology and algorithms advance, and VQC architectures improve, we posit that VQCs could become advantageous for certain machine learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCS 2025</p></details> |

However, these agents often exploit spurious correlations in the training data, resulting in brittle behaviours that fail to generalize to new or slightly modified environments. To address this, we introduce the Causal Object-centric Model Extraction Tool (COMET), a novel algorithm designed to learn the exact interpretable causal world models (CWMs). COMET first extracts object-centric state descriptions from observations and identifies the environment's internal states related to the depicted objects' properties. Using symbolic regression, it models object-centric transitions and derives causal relationships governing object dynamics. COMET further incorporates large language models (LLMs) for semantic inference, annotating causal variables to enhance interpretability. By leveraging these capabilities, COMET constructs CWMs that align with the true causal structure of the environment, enabling agents to focus on task-relevant features. The extracted CWMs mitigate the danger of shortcuts, permitting the development of RL systems capable of better planning and decision-making across dynamic scenarios. Our results, validated in Atari environments such as Pong and Freeway, demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of COMET, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between object-centric reasoning and causal inference in reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages including references, 2 figures</p></details> |

Prior works have explored prompt evolving, but are often limited to the supervised fine-tuning stage, and prompts are sampled and evolved uniformly without signals. This empirical work presents a paradigm shift: Evolving Alignment via Asymmetric Self-Play (eva), that casts post-training as an infinite game with regret-based signals for 2 players: (i) a creator, who strategically samples and creates new informative prompts and (ii) a solver, who learns to produce preferred responses. eva is the first method that allows language models to adaptively create training prompts in both offline and online RL post-training. The design is simple, easy-to-use yet remarkably effective: eva sets a new SOTA on challenging benchmarks, without any extra human prompts, e.g. it boosts the win-rate of gemma-2-9b-it on Arena-Hard by 51.6% -> 60.1% for DPO and 52.6% -> 62.4% for RLOO, surpassing claude-3-opus and catching up to gemini-1.5-pro, both of which are orders of magnitude larger. Extensive experiments show eva can create effective RL curricula and is robust across ablations. We believe adaptively evolving prompts are key to designing the next-generation RL post-training scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>spotl...</summary><p>spotlight @ neurips language gamification workshop. updated the problem description and added new online RL experiments in this version</p></details> |

A motion dynamic model is essential for efficient skill acquisition and effective planning. In this work, we introduce the neural motion simulator (MoSim), a world model that predicts the future physical state of an embodied system based on current observations and actions. MoSim achieves state-of-the-art performance in physical state prediction and provides competitive performance across a range of downstream tasks. This works shows that when a world model is accurate enough and performs precise long-horizon predictions, it can facilitate efficient skill acquisition in imagined worlds and even enable zero-shot reinforcement learning. Furthermore, MoSim can transform any model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm into a model-based approach, effectively decoupling physical environment modeling from RL algorithm development. This separation allows for independent advancements in RL algorithms and world modeling, significantly improving sample efficiency and enhancing generalization capabilities. Our findings highlight that world models for motion dynamics is a promising direction for developing more versatile and capable embodied systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (main), 2-page appendix, 8 figures, accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Assistance games resolve key drawbacks of RLHF, such as incentives for deceptive behavior, by explicitly modeling the interaction between assistant and user as a two-player game where the assistant cannot observe their shared goal. Despite their potential, assistance games have only been explored in simple settings. Scaling them to more complex environments is difficult because it requires both solving intractable decision-making problems under uncertainty and accurately modeling human users' behavior. We present the first scalable approach to solving assistance games and apply it to a new, challenging Minecraft-based assistance game with over $10^{400}$ possible goals. Our approach, AssistanceZero, extends AlphaZero with a neural network that predicts human actions and rewards, enabling it to plan under uncertainty. We show that AssistanceZero outperforms model-free RL algorithms and imitation learning in the Minecraft-based assistance game. In a human study, our AssistanceZero-trained assistant significantly reduces the number of actions participants take to complete building tasks in Minecraft. Our results suggest that assistance games are a tractable framework for training effective AI assistants in complex environments.

However, this progress often outpaces methodological rigor, with many evaluations relying on benchmarking practices that lack transparency, robustness, or statistical grounding. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study and find that current mathematical reasoning benchmarks are highly sensitive to subtle implementation choices - including decoding parameters, random seeds, prompt formatting, and even hardware and software-framework configurations. Performance gains reported in recent studies frequently hinge on unclear comparisons or unreported sources of variance. To address these issues, we propose a standardized evaluation framework with clearly defined best practices and reporting standards. Using this framework, we reassess recent methods and find that reinforcement learning (RL) approaches yield only modest improvements - far below prior claims - and are prone to overfitting, especially on small-scale benchmarks like AIME24. In contrast, supervised finetuning (SFT) methods show consistently stronger generalization. To foster reproducibility, we release all code, prompts, and model outputs, for reasoning benchmarks, establishing more rigorous foundations for future work.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Backtracking naturally scales test-time compute by enabling sequential, linearized exploration via long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, this is not the only strategy for scaling test-time compute: parallel sampling with best-of-n selection provides an alternative that generates diverse solutions simultaneously. Despite the growing adoption of sequential search, its advantages over parallel sampling--especially under a fixed compute budget remain poorly understood. In this paper, we systematically compare these two approaches on two challenging reasoning tasks: CountDown and Sudoku. Surprisingly, we find that sequential search underperforms parallel sampling on CountDown but outperforms it on Sudoku, suggesting that backtracking is not universally beneficial. We identify two factors that can cause backtracking to degrade performance: (1) training on fixed search traces can lock models into suboptimal strategies, and (2) explicit CoT supervision can discourage "implicit" (non-verbalized) reasoning. Extending our analysis to reinforcement learning (RL), we show that models with backtracking capabilities benefit significantly from RL fine-tuning, while models without backtracking see limited, mixed gains. Together, these findings challenge the assumption that backtracking universally enhances LLM reasoning, instead revealing a complex interaction between task structure, training data, model scale, and learning paradigm.</p></details> |  |

Existing backdoor triggers are typically limited to fixed word patterns, making them detectable during data cleaning and easily removable post-poisoning. In this work, we explore the use of prompt-specific paraphrases as backdoor triggers, enhancing their stealth and resistance to removal during LLM alignment. We propose AdvBDGen, an adversarially fortified generative fine-tuning framework that automatically generates prompt-specific backdoors that are effective, stealthy, and transferable across models. AdvBDGen employs a generator-discriminator pair, fortified by an adversary, to ensure the installability and stealthiness of backdoors. It enables the crafting and successful installation of complex triggers using as little as 3% of the fine-tuning data. Once installed, these backdoors can jailbreak LLMs during inference, demonstrate improved stability against perturbations compared to traditional constant triggers, and are more challenging to remove. These findings underscore an urgent need for the research community to develop more robust defenses against adversarial backdoor threats in LLM alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Neurips Safe Generative AI Workshop 2024</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Fidelity Policy Gradient Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05696v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms require large amounts of data, prohibiting their use in applications where frequent interactions with operational systems are infeasible, or high-fidelity simulations are expensive or unavailable. Meanwhile, low-fidelity simulators--such as reduced-order models, heuristic reward functions, or generative world models--can cheaply provide useful data for RL training, even if they are too coarse for direct sim-to-real transfer. We propose multi-fidelity policy gradients (MFPGs), an RL framework that mixes a small amount of data from the target environment with a large volume of low-fidelity simulation data to form unbiased, reduced-variance estimators (control variates) for on-policy policy gradients. We instantiate the framework by developing multi-fidelity variants of two policy gradient algorithms: REINFORCE and proximal policy optimization. Experimental results across a suite of simulated robotics benchmark problems demonstrate that when target-environment samples are limited, MFPG achieves up to 3.9x higher reward and improves training stability when compared to baselines that only use high-fidelity data. Moreover, even when the baselines are given more high-fidelity samples--up to 10x as many interactions with the target environment--MFPG continues to match or outperform them. Finally, we observe that MFPG is capable of training effective policies even when the low-fidelity environment is drastically different from the target environment. MFPG thus not only offers a novel paradigm for efficient sim-to-real transfer but also provides a principled approach to managing the trade-off between policy performance and data collection costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Free Random Projection for In-Context Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06983v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical inductive biases are hypothesized to promote generalizable policies in reinforcement learning, as demonstrated by explicit hyperbolic latent representations and architectures. Therefore, a more flexible approach is to have these biases emerge naturally from the algorithm. We introduce Free Random Projection, an input mapping grounded in free probability theory that constructs random orthogonal matrices where hierarchical structure arises inherently. The free random projection integrates seamlessly into existing in-context reinforcement learning frameworks by encoding hierarchical organization within the input space without requiring explicit architectural modifications. Empirical results on multi-environment benchmarks show that free random projection consistently outperforms the standard random projection, leading to improvements in generalization. Furthermore, analyses within linearly solvable Markov decision processes and investigations of the spectrum of kernel random matrices reveal the theoretical underpinnings of free random projection's enhanced performance, highlighting its capacity for effective adaptation in hierarchically structured state spaces.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Preference-Based Alignment of Discrete Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08295v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains, with recent advancements extending their applicability to discrete data. However, aligning discrete diffusion models with task-specific preferences remains challenging, particularly in scenarios where explicit reward functions are unavailable. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion DPO (D2-DPO), the first adaptation of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to discrete diffusion models formulated as continuous-time Markov chains. Our approach derives a novel loss function that directly fine-tunes the generative process using preference data while preserving fidelity to a reference distribution. We validate D2-DPO on a structured binary sequence generation task, demonstrating that the method effectively aligns model outputs with preferences while maintaining structural validity. Our results highlight that D2-DPO enables controlled fine-tuning without requiring explicit reward models, making it a practical alternative to reinforcement learning-based approaches. Future research will explore extending D2-DPO to more complex generative tasks, including language modeling and protein sequence generation, as well as investigating alternative noise schedules, such as uniform noising, to enhance flexibility across different applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regret Bounds for Robust Online Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06820v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a framework which generalizes "decision making with structured observations" by allowing robust (i.e. multivalued) models. In this framework, each model associates each decision with a convex set of probability distributions over outcomes. Nature can choose distributions out of this set in an arbitrary (adversarial) manner, that can be nonoblivious and depend on past history. The resulting framework offers much greater generality than classical bandits and reinforcement learning, since the realizability assumption becomes much weaker and more realistic. We then derive a theory of regret bounds for this framework. Although our lower and upper bounds are not tight, they are sufficient to fully characterize power-law learnability. We demonstrate this theory in two special cases: robust linear bandits and tabular robust online reinforcement learning. In both cases, we derive regret bounds that improve state-of-the-art (except that we do not address computational efficiency).</p></details> |  |

Recent occlusion-aware decision-making methods encounter issues such as high computational complexity, scenario scalability challenges, or reliance on limited expert data. Benefiting from automatically generating data by exploration randomization, we uncover that reinforcement learning (RL) may show promise in occlusion-aware decision-making. However, previous occlusion-aware RL faces challenges in expanding to various dynamic and static occlusion scenarios, low learning efficiency, and lack of predictive ability. To address these issues, we introduce Pad-AI, a self-reinforcing framework to learn occlusion-aware decision-making through active perception. Pad-AI utilizes vectorized representation to represent occluded environments efficiently and learns over the semantic motion primitives to focus on high-level active perception exploration. Furthermore, Pad-AI integrates prediction and RL within a unified framework to provide risk-aware learning and security guarantees. Our framework was tested in challenging scenarios under both dynamic and static occlusions and demonstrated efficient and general perception-aware exploration performance to other strong baselines in closed-loop evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

We employed Monte-Carlo Probabilistic Inference for Learning Control (MC-PILCO), an MBRL algorithm recognized for its exceptional data efficiency across various low-dimensional robotic tasks, including cart-pole, ball \& plate, and Furuta pendulum systems. MC-PILCO optimizes a system dynamics model using interaction data, enabling policy refinement through simulation rather than direct system data optimization. This approach has proven highly effective in physical systems, offering greater data efficiency than Model-Free (MF) alternatives. Notably, MC-PILCO has previously won the first two editions of this competition, demonstrating its robustness in both simulated and real-world environments. Besides briefly reviewing the algorithm, we discuss the most critical aspects of the MC-PILCO implementation in the tasks at hand: learning a global policy for the pendubot and acrobot systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.05811</p></details> |

However, such representations fail to capture higher-order collaborations, limiting effectiveness in complex tasks. While hypergraph-based approaches enhance cooperation, existing methods often generate arbitrary hypergraph structures and lack adaptability to environmental uncertainties. To address these challenges, we propose the Skewness-Driven Hypergraph Network (SDHN), which employs stochastic Bernoulli hyperedges to explicitly model higher-order multi-robot interactions. By introducing a skewness loss, SDHN promotes an efficient structure with Small-Hyperedge Dominant Hypergraph, allowing robots to prioritize localized synchronization while still adhering to the overall information, similar to human coordination. Extensive experiments on Moving Agents in Formation and Robotic Warehouse tasks validate SDHN's effectiveness, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperparameter Optimisation with Practical Interpretability and Explanation Methods in Probabilistic Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06683v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) is crucial for achieving strong performance in reinforcement learning (RL), as RL algorithms are inherently sensitive to hyperparameter settings. Probabilistic Curriculum Learning (PCL) is a curriculum learning strategy designed to improve RL performance by structuring the agent's learning process, yet effective hyperparameter tuning remains challenging and computationally demanding. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis of hyperparameter interactions and their effects on the performance of a PCL algorithm within standard RL tasks, including point-maze navigation and DC motor control. Using the AlgOS framework integrated with Optuna's Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (TPE), we present strategies to refine hyperparameter search spaces, enhancing optimisation efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a novel SHAP-based interpretability approach tailored specifically for analysing hyperparameter impacts, offering clear insights into how individual hyperparameters and their interactions influence RL performance. Our work contributes practical guidelines and interpretability tools that significantly improve the effectiveness and computational feasibility of hyperparameter optimisation in reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Residual Safe Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Safety-Critical Scenarios Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06670v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-agent safety-critical scenarios, traditional autonomous driving frameworks face significant challenges in balancing safety constraints and task performance. These frameworks struggle to quantify dynamic interaction risks in real-time and depend heavily on manual rules, resulting in low computational efficiency and conservative strategies. To address these limitations, we propose a Dynamic Residual Safe Reinforcement Learning (DRS-RL) framework grounded in a safety-enhanced networked Markov decision process. It's the first time that the weak-to-strong theory is introduced into multi-agent decision-making, enabling lightweight dynamic calibration of safety boundaries via a weak-to-strong safety correction paradigm. Based on the multi-agent dynamic conflict zone model, our framework accurately captures spatiotemporal coupling risks among heterogeneous traffic participants and surpasses the static constraints of conventional geometric rules. Moreover, a risk-aware prioritized experience replay mechanism mitigates data distribution bias by mapping risk to sampling probability. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional RL algorithms in safety, efficiency, and comfort. Specifically, it reduces the collision rate by up to 92.17%, while the safety model accounts for merely 27% of the main model's parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robo-taxi Fleet Coordination at Scale via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06125v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fleets of robo-taxis offering on-demand transportation services, commonly known as Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, hold significant promise for societal benefits, such as reducing pollution, energy consumption, and urban congestion. However, orchestrating these systems at scale remains a critical challenge, with existing coordination algorithms often failing to exploit the systems' full potential. This work introduces a novel decision-making framework that unites mathematical modeling with data-driven techniques. In particular, we present the AMoD coordination problem through the lens of reinforcement learning and propose a graph network-based framework that exploits the main strengths of graph representation learning, reinforcement learning, and classical operations research tools. Extensive evaluations across diverse simulation fidelities and scenarios demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, achieving superior system performance, computational efficiency, and generalizability compared to prior methods. Finally, motivated by the need to democratize research efforts in this area, we release publicly available benchmarks, datasets, and simulators for network-level coordination alongside an open-source codebase designed to provide accessible simulation platforms and establish a standardized validation process for comparing methodologies.

While model-based controllers provide interpretable dynamics-level planning and optimization, they are limited by model inaccuracies and computational cost. In contrast, learning-based methods offer robustness while struggling with precise modulation of interaction forces. We introduce RAMBO -- RL-Augmented Model-Based Optimal Control -- a hybrid framework that integrates model-based reaction force optimization using a simplified dynamics model and a feedback policy trained with reinforcement learning. The model-based module generates feedforward torques by solving a quadratic program, while the policy provides feedback residuals to enhance robustness in control execution. We validate our framework on a quadruped robot across a diverse set of real-world loco-manipulation tasks -- such as pushing a shopping cart, balancing a plate, and holding soft objects -- in both quadrupedal and bipedal walking. Our experiments demonstrate that RAMBO enables precise manipulation while achieving robust and dynamic locomotion, surpassing the performance of policies trained with end-to-end scheme. In addition, our method enables flexible trade-off between end-effector tracking accuracy with compliance.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Bridging the Gap Between Preference Alignment and Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06659v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in Preference Alignment (PA) for Large Language Models (LLMs), mainstream methods like Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) face notable challenges. These approaches require high-quality datasets of positive preference examples, which are costly to obtain and computationally intensive due to training instability, limiting their use in low-resource scenarios. LLM unlearning technique presents a promising alternative, by directly removing the influence of negative examples. However, current research has primarily focused on empirical validation, lacking systematic quantitative analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework to explore the relationship between PA and LLM unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a bi-level optimization-based method to quantify the impact of unlearning specific negative examples on PA performance. Our analysis reveals that not all negative examples contribute equally to alignment improvement when unlearned, and the effect varies significantly across examples. Building on this insight, we pose a crucial question: how can we optimally select and weight negative examples for unlearning to maximize PA performance? To answer this, we propose a framework called Unlearning to Align (U2A), which leverages bi-level optimization to efficiently select and unlearn examples for optimal PA performance. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, with results confirming its effectiveness.</p></details> | 17 pages |

While several algorithms exhibit compositionality, they fail to elucidate how humans learn to compose concept classes and ground visual cues through trial and error. To investigate this multi-modal learning challenge, we designed a 3D synthetic environment in which an agent learns, via reinforcement, to navigate to a target specified by a natural language instruction. These instructions comprise nouns, attributes, and critically, determiners, prepositions, or both. The vast array of word combinations heightens the compositional complexity of the visual grounding task, as navigating to a blue cube above red spheres is not rewarded when the instruction specifies navigating to "some blue cubes below the red sphere". We first demonstrate that reinforcement learning agents can ground determiner concepts to visual targets but struggle with more complex prepositional concepts. Second, we show that curriculum learning, a strategy humans employ, enhances concept learning efficiency, reducing the required training episodes by 15% in determiner environments and enabling agents to easily learn prepositional concepts. Finally, we establish that agents trained on determiner or prepositional concepts can decompose held-out test instructions and rapidly adapt their navigation policies to unseen visual object combinations. Leveraging synthetic environments, our findings demonstrate that multi-modal reinforcement learning agents can achieve compositional understanding of complex concept classes and highlight the efficacy of human-like learning strategies in improving artificial systems' learning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, ATP has not yet be revolutionized by the recent posttraining scaling as demonstrated by Open AI O1/O3 and Deepseek R1. In this work, we investigate the entire posttraining of ATP, aiming to align it with breakthroughs in reasoning models in natural languages. To begin, we continual train current ATP models with a hybrid dataset, which consists of numerous statement-proof pairs, and additional data aimed at incorporating cognitive behaviors that emulate human reasoning and hypothesis refinement. Next, we explore reinforcement learning with the use of outcome reward returned by Lean 4 compiler. Through our designed continual training and reinforcement learning processes, we have successfully improved existing formal provers, including both DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5 and Goedel-Prover, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of whole-proof generation. For example, we achieve a 59.8% pass rate (pass@32) on MiniF2F. This is an on-going project and we will progressively update our findings, release our data and training details.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Do Reasoning Models Show Better Verbalized Calibration?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06564v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning by leveraging increased test-time computation and exhibiting behaviors akin to human-like deliberation. Despite these advances, it remains an open question whether LRMs are better calibrated - particularly in their verbalized confidence - compared to instruction-tuned counterparts. In this paper, we investigate the calibration properties of LRMs trained via supervised fine-tuning distillation on long reasoning traces (henceforth SFT reasoning models) and outcome-based reinforcement learning for reasoning (henceforth RL reasoning models) across diverse domains. Our findings reveal that LRMs significantly outperform instruction-tuned models on complex reasoning tasks in both accuracy and confidence calibration. In contrast, we find surprising trends in the domain of factuality in particular. On factuality tasks, while Deepseek-R1 shows strong calibration behavior, smaller QwQ-32B shows no improvement over instruct models; moreover, SFT reasoning models display worse calibration (greater overconfidence) compared to instruct models. Our results provide evidence for a potentially critical role of reasoning-oriented RL training in improving LLMs' capacity for generating trustworthy, self-aware outputs.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Robust Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Large Language Models Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03784v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique for aligning the output of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. To learn the reward function, most existing RLHF algorithms use the Bradley-Terry model, which relies on assumptions about human preferences that may not reflect the complexity and variability of real-world judgments. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm to enhance the performance of existing approaches under such reward model misspecifications. Theoretically, our algorithm reduces the variance of reward and policy estimators, leading to improved regret bounds. Empirical evaluations on LLM benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing methods, with 77-81% of responses being favored over baselines on the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless dataset.</p></details> |  |

By reformulating the deterministic outputs of flow-matching TTS into probabilistic Gaussian distributions, our approach enables seamless integration of reinforcement learning algorithms. During pretraining, we train a probabilistically reformulated flow-matching based model which is derived from F5-TTS with an open-source dataset. In the subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) phase, we employ a GRPO-driven enhancement stage that leverages dual reward metrics: word error rate (WER) computed via automatic speech recognition and speaker similarity (SIM) assessed by verification models. Experimental results on zero-shot voice cloning demonstrate that F5R-TTS achieves significant improvements in both speech intelligibility (a 29.5% relative reduction in WER) and speaker similarity (a 4.6% relative increase in SIM score) compared to conventional flow-matching based TTS systems.

This newly introduced scenario exacerbates the general overthinking issue to a large extent, which we name as the MiP-Overthinking. Such failures are against the ``test-time scaling law'' but have been widely observed on multiple datasets we curated with MiP, indicating the harm of cheap overthinking and a lack of critical thinking. Surprisingly, LLMs not specifically trained for reasoning exhibit much better performance on the MiP scenario, producing much shorter responses that quickly identify ill-posed queries. This implies a critical flaw of the current training recipe for reasoning LLMs, which does not encourage efficient thinking adequately, leading to the abuse of thinking patterns. To further investigate the reasons behind such failures, we conduct fine-grained analyses of the reasoning length, overthinking patterns, and location of critical thinking on different types of LLMs. Moreover, our extended ablation study reveals that the overthinking is contagious through the distillation of reasoning models' responses. These results improve the understanding of overthinking and shed novel insights into mitigating the problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Algorithm Discovery With LLMs: Evolutionary Search Meets Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05108v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman, and the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search improves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and mathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.</p></details> | 30 pages |

This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages digital twins (DTs) as priors to enable efficient zone-specific subspace-based channel estimation (CE). Subspace-based CE significantly reduces feedback overhead by focusing on the dominant channel components, exploiting sparsity in the angular domain while preserving estimation accuracy. While DT channels may exhibit inaccuracies, their coarse-grained subspaces provide a powerful starting point, reducing the search space and accelerating convergence. The framework employs a two-step clustering process on the Grassmann manifold, combined with reinforcement learning (RL), to iteratively calibrate subspaces and align them with real-world counterparts. Simulations show that digital twins not only enable near-optimal performance but also enhance the accuracy of subspace calibration through RL, highlighting their potential as a step towards learnable digital twins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset and code files are available on the WI-Lab website: https://www.wi-lab.net/research/</p></details> |

In the first part of this paper, the concepts of the bitboard-representation and the advantages of (rotated) bitboards in move generation are explained. In order to illustrate those ideas practice, the concrete implementation of the move-generator in FUSc# is discussed and we explain a technique how to verify the move-generator with the "perft"-command. We show that the move-generator of FUSc# works 100% correct. The second part of this paper deals with reinforcement learning in computer chess (and beyond). We exemplify the progress that has been made in this field in the last 15-20 years by comparing the "state of the art" from 2002-2008, when FUSc# was developed, with recent innovations connected to "AlphaZero". We discuss how a "FUSc#-Zero" could be implemented and what would be necessary to reduce the number of training games necessary to achieve a good performance. This can be seen as a test case to the general prblem of improving "sample effciency" in reinforcement learning. In the final part, we move beyond computer chess, as the importance of sample effciency extends far beyond board games into a wide range of applications where data is costly, diffcult to obtain, or time consuming to generate. We review some application of the ideas developed in AlphaZero in other domains, i.e. the "other Alphas" like AlphaFold, AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry and AlphaProof.

We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.</p></details> | 42 pages, 4 figures |

In most realistic scenarios however, the Markovian state transition probabilities are unknown and therefore the Gittins indices cannot be computed. One can then resort to reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that explore the state space to learn these indices while exploiting to maximize the reward collected. In this work, we propose tabular (QGI) and Deep RL (DGN) algorithms for learning the Gittins index that are based on the retirement formulation for the multi-arm bandit problem. When compared with existing RL algorithms that learn the Gittins index, our algorithms have a lower run time, require less storage space (small Q-table size in QGI and smaller replay buffer in DGN), and illustrate better empirical convergence to the Gittins index. This makes our algorithm well suited for problems with large state spaces and is a viable alternative to existing methods. As a key application, we demonstrate the use of our algorithms in minimizing the mean flowtime in a job scheduling problem when jobs are available in batches and have an unknown service time distribution.</p></details> |  |

In this work we present novel theoretical results that provide a bound on the probability of violating a safety property for a new task-specific policy in a model-free, episodic setup: the bound, based on a `maximum policy ratio' that is computed with respect to a `safe' base policy, can also be more generally applied to temporally-extended properties (beyond safety) and to robust control problems. We thus present SPoRt, which also provides a data-driven approach for obtaining such a bound for the base policy, based on scenario theory, and which includes Projected PPO, a new projection-based approach for training the task-specific policy while maintaining a user-specified bound on property violation. Hence, SPoRt enables the user to trade off safety guarantees in exchange for task-specific performance. Accordingly, we present experimental results demonstrating this trade-off, as well as a comparison of the theoretical bound to posterior bounds based on empirical violation rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages + 16 pages supplementary material, 3 figures + 6 figures supplementary material</p></details> |

However, due to privacy concerns, users may be reluctant to share sensitive preference data. To address this, we propose utilizing Federated Learning (FL) techniques, allowing large-scale preference collection from diverse real-world users without requiring them to transmit data to a central server. Our federated RLHF methods (i.e., FedBis and FedBiscuit) encode each client's preferences into binary selectors and aggregate them to capture common preferences. In particular, FedBiscuit overcomes key challenges, such as preference heterogeneity and reward hacking, through innovative solutions like grouping clients with similar preferences to reduce heterogeneity and using multiple binary selectors to enhance LLM output quality. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we establish the first federated RLHF benchmark with a heterogeneous human preference dataset. Experimental results show that by integrating the LLM with aggregated client preferences, FedBis and FedBiscuit significantly enhance the professionalism and readability of the generated content.</p></details> | ICLR'25 |
| **[An Information-Geometric Approach to Artificial Curiosity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06355v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning in environments with sparse rewards remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Artificial curiosity addresses this limitation through intrinsic rewards to guide exploration, however, the precise formulation of these rewards has remained elusive. Ideally, such rewards should depend on the agent's information about the environment, remaining agnostic to the representation of the information -- an invariance central to information geometry. Leveraging information geometry, we show that invariance under congruent Markov morphisms and the agent-environment interaction, uniquely constrains intrinsic rewards to concave functions of the reciprocal occupancy. Additional geometrically motivated restrictions effectively limits the candidates to those determined by a real parameter that governs the occupancy space geometry. Remarkably, special values of this parameter are found to correspond to count-based and maximum entropy exploration, revealing a geometric exploration-exploitation trade-off. This framework provides important constraints to the engineering of intrinsic reward while integrating foundational exploration methods into a single, cohesive model.</p></details> | 22 pages, 1 figure |

However, these approaches often require task-specific demonstrations or designing complex simulation environments, which limits the development of generalizable and robust policies for unseen real-world settings. Recent advances in the use of foundation models for robotics (e.g., LLMs, VLMs) have shown great potential in enabling systems to understand the semantics in the world from large-scale internet data. However, it remains an open challenge to use this knowledge to enable robotic systems to understand the underlying dynamics of the world, to generalize policies across different tasks, and to adapt policies to new environments. To alleviate these limitations, we propose an agentic framework for robot self-guidance and self-improvement, which consists of a set of role-specialized conversational agents, such as a high-level advisor, a grounding agent, a monitoring agent, and a robotic agent. Our framework iteratively grounds a base robot policy to relevant objects in the environment and uses visuomotor cues to shift the action distribution of the policy to more desirable states, online, while remaining agnostic to the subjective configuration of a given robot hardware platform. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide manipulation policies to achieve significantly higher success rates, both in simulation and in real-world experiments, without the need for additional human demonstrations or extensive exploration.

Previous research efforts have explored the capabilities of MARL algorithms within Hanabi, focusing largely on advanced architecture design and algorithmic manipulations to achieve state-of-the-art performance for a various number of cooperators. However, this often leads to complex solution strategies with high computational cost and requiring large amounts of training data. For humans to solve the Hanabi game effectively, they require the use of conventions, which often allows for a means to implicitly convey ideas or knowledge based on a predefined, and mutually agreed upon, set of ``rules''. Multi-agent problems containing partial observability, especially when limited communication is present, can benefit greatly from the use of implicit knowledge sharing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to augmenting the action space using conventions, which act as special cooperative actions that span over multiple time steps and multiple agents, requiring agents to actively opt in for it to reach fruition. These conventions are based on existing human conventions, and result in a significant improvement on the performance of existing techniques for self-play and cross-play across a various number of cooperators within Hanabi.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review at the journal of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (JAAMAS).

| **[Adversarial Training of Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06141v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward modeling has emerged as a promising approach for the scalable alignment of language models. However, contemporary reward models (RMs) often lack robustness, awarding high rewards to low-quality, out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. This can lead to reward hacking, where policies exploit unintended shortcuts to maximize rewards, undermining alignment. To address this challenge, we introduce Adv-RM, a novel adversarial training framework that automatically identifies adversarial examples -- responses that receive high rewards from the target RM but are OOD and of low quality. By leveraging reinforcement learning, Adv-RM trains a policy to generate adversarial examples that reliably expose vulnerabilities in large state-of-the-art reward models such as Nemotron 340B RM. Incorporating these adversarial examples into the reward training process improves the robustness of RMs, mitigating reward hacking and enhancing downstream performance in RLHF. We demonstrate that Adv-RM significantly outperforms conventional RM training, increasing stability and enabling more effective RLHF training in both synthetic and real-data settings.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

Solving VRP in real-time at large scale has become critical in numerous applications, from growing markets like last-mile delivery to emerging use-cases like interactive logistics planning. Such applications involve solving similar problem instances repeatedly, yet current state-of-the-art solvers treat each instance on its own without leveraging previous examples. We introduce a novel optimization framework that uses a reinforcement learning agent - trained on prior instances - to quickly generate initial solutions, which are then further optimized by genetic algorithms. Our framework, Evolutionary Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning Initialization (EARLI), consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art solvers across various time scales. For example, EARLI handles vehicle routing with 500 locations within 1s, 10x faster than current solvers for the same solution quality, enabling applications like real-time and interactive routing. EARLI can generalize to new data, as demonstrated on real e-commerce delivery data of a previously unseen city. Our hybrid framework presents a new way to combine reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms, paving the road for closer interdisciplinary collaboration between AI and optimization communities towards real-time optimization in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unraveling Arithmetic in Large Language Models: The Role of Algebraic Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16260v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have improved with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, allowing models to solve complex tasks stepwise. However, training CoT capabilities requires detailed reasoning data, which is often scarce. The self-taught reasoner (STaR) framework addresses this by using reinforcement learning to automatically generate reasoning steps, reducing reliance on human-labeled data. Although STaR and its variants have demonstrated empirical success, a theoretical foundation explaining these improvements is lacking. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable mathematical capabilities, largely driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which decomposes complex reasoning into step-by-step solutions. However, the mechanisms underlying LLMs' ability to perform arithmetic in a single step of CoT remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose that LLMs learn arithmetic by capturing algebraic structures, such as commutativity and identity properties. Since these structures are observable through input-output relationships, they can generalize to unseen data. We empirically demonstrate that LLMs can learn algebraic structures using a custom dataset of arithmetic problems, as well as providing theoretical evidence showing that, under specific configurations of weights and biases, the transformer-based LLMs can generate embeddings that remain invariant to both permutations of input tokens and the presence of identity elements. Our findings indicate that leveraging algebraic structures can enhance the LLMs' arithmetic capabilities, offering insights into improving their arithmetic performance.</p></details> |  |

Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning frameworks where the LLM learns to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 41% (Qwen2.5-7B) and 20% (Qwen2.5-3B) over various RAG baselines under the same setting. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

However, scaling MCTS to parallel compute has proven challenging in practice which has motivated alternative planners like sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC). Many of these SMC methods adopt particle filters for smoothing through a reformulation of RL as a policy inference problem. Yet, persisting design choices of these particle filters often conflict with the aim of online planning in RL, which is to obtain a policy improvement at the start of planning. Drawing inspiration from MCTS, we tailor SMC planners specifically for RL by improving data generation within the planner through constrained action sampling and explicit terminal state handling, as well as improving policy and value target estimation. This leads to our Trust-Region Twisted SMC (TRT-SMC), which shows improved runtime and sample-efficiency over baseline MCTS and SMC methods in both discrete and continuous domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information-Theoretic Reward Decomposition for Generalizable RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06020v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A generalizable reward model is crucial in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) as it enables correctly evaluating unseen prompt-response pairs. However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done during internships at Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom</p></details> |
| **[A Geometric-Aware Perspective and Beyond: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06328v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric Machine Learning (GML) has shown that respecting non-Euclidean geometry in data spaces can significantly improve performance over naive Euclidean assumptions. In parallel, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm that leverages superposition, entanglement, and interference within quantum state manifolds for learning tasks. This paper offers a unifying perspective by casting QML as a specialized yet more expressive branch of GML. We argue that quantum states, whether pure or mixed, reside on curved manifolds (e.g., projective Hilbert spaces or density-operator manifolds), mirroring how covariance matrices inhabit the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices or how image sets occupy Grassmann manifolds. However, QML also benefits from purely quantum properties, such as entanglement-induced curvature, that can yield richer kernel structures and more nuanced data embeddings. We illustrate these ideas with published and newly discussed results, including hybrid classical -quantum pipelines for diabetic foot ulcer classification and structural health monitoring. Despite near-term hardware limitations that constrain purely quantum solutions, hybrid architectures already demonstrate tangible benefits by combining classical manifold-based feature extraction with quantum embeddings. We present a detailed mathematical treatment of the geometrical underpinnings of quantum states, emphasizing parallels to classical Riemannian geometry and manifold-based optimization. Finally, we outline open research challenges and future directions, including Quantum Large Language Models (LLMs), quantum reinforcement learning, and emerging hardware approaches, demonstrating how synergizing GML and QML principles can unlock the next generation of machine intelligence.</p></details> | 19 pages, 3 figures |

Building upon the foundation laid by [1], we extend their work to address the non-preemptive scheduling problem, which is known to be NP-hard. By modeling this scheduling challenge as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we develop an RL agent capable of generating near-optimal schedules for real-time MC systems. Our RL-based scheduler prioritizes high-critical tasks while maintaining overall system performance. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The RL scheduler significantly improves task completion rates, achieving around 80% overall and 85% for high-criticality tasks across 100,000 instances of synthetic data and real data under varying system conditions. Moreover, under stable conditions without degradation, the scheduler achieves 94% overall task completion and 93% for high-criticality tasks. These results highlight the potential of RL-based schedulers in real-time and safety-critical applications, offering substantial improvements in handling complex and dynamic scheduling scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was submitted to the 32nd International Conference on Real-Time Networks and Systems (RTNS) on June 8, 2024</p></details> |

We propose using prior model knowledge to guide the exploration process to speed up this learning process. This model knowledge comes in the form of a model set to which the true transition kernel and reward function belong. We optimize over this model set to obtain upper and lower bounds on the Q-function, which are then used to guide the exploration of the agent. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the Q-function to the optimal Q-function under the proposed class of exploring policies. Furthermore, we also introduce a data-driven regularized version of the model set optimization problem that ensures the convergence of the class of exploring policies to the optimal policy. Lastly, we show that when the model set has a specific structure, namely the bounded-parameter MDP (BMDP) framework, the regularized model set optimization problem becomes convex and simple to implement. In this setting, we also show that we obtain finite-time convergence to the optimal policy under additional assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed exploration strategy in a simulation study. The results indicate that the proposed method can significantly speed up the learning process in reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication</p></details> |

Predicting KOA progression is crucial for improving patient outcomes, optimizing healthcare resources, studying the disease, and developing new treatments. The latter application particularly requires one to understand the disease progression in order to collect the most informative data at the right time. Existing methods, however, are limited by their static nature and their focus on individual joints, leading to suboptimal predictive performance and downstream utility. Our study proposes a new method that allows to dynamically monitor patients rather than individual joints with KOA using a novel Active Sensing (AS) approach powered by Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our key idea is to directly optimize for the downstream task by training an agent that maximizes informative data collection while minimizing overall costs. Our RL-based method leverages a specially designed reward function to monitor disease progression across multiple body parts, employs multimodal deep learning, and requires no human input during testing. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art models, paving the way for the next generation of KOA trials.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements, training machines to capture regions of interest for comprehensive scene understanding, like human perception and reasoning, remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel framework, Human Attention-based Explainable Guidance for Intelligent Vehicle Systems (AEGIS). AEGIS utilizes human attention, converted from eye-tracking, to guide reinforcement learning (RL) models to identify critical regions of interest for decision-making. AEGIS uses a pre-trained human attention model to guide RL models to identify critical regions of interest for decision-making. By collecting 1.2 million frames from 20 participants across six scenarios, AEGIS pre-trains a model to predict human attention patterns.</p></details> |  |

Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are preferred for navigating in these complex, GPS-denied scenarios because of their agility, low power consumption, and limited computational capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning based Deep-Proximal Policy Optimization (D-PPO) algorithm to enhance realtime navigation through improving the computation efficiency. The end-to-end network is trained in 3D realistic meta-environments created using the Unreal Engine. With these trained meta-weights, the MAV system underwent extensive experimental trials in real-world indoor environments. The results indicate that the proposed method reduces computational latency by 91\% during training period without significant degradation in performance. The algorithm was tested on a DJI Tello drone, yielding similar results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization: Balancing Safety-Helpfulness in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15313v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on human preferences, typically through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has proven successful in enhancing their capabilities. However, ensuring the safety of LLMs during fine-tuning remains a critical concern, and mitigating the potential conflicts in safety and helpfulness is costly in RLHF. To address this issue, we propose a supervised learning framework called Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization (BFPO), which re-parameterizes a joint RLHF objective of both safety and helpfulness into a single supervised learning objective. In supervised optimization, a labeling function is used to capture the global preferences ranking to balance both safety and helpfulness. To evaluate BFPO, we develop a benchmark that includes comprehensive discriminative and generative tasks for helpfulness and harmlessness. The results indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both safety and helpfulness. Moreover, BFPO achieves the same level of safety as methods that heavily rely on human labor with less than 10\% of the computational resources and human prompting and annotation process. The training recipes can be found here: https://github.com/wx-zhang/bfpo.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted in ICLR 2025 as spotlight presentation</p></details> |

However, reward hacking-a phenomenon where models exploit flaws in the reward model-remains a significant barrier to achieving robust and scalable intelligence through long-term training. Existing studies have proposed uncertain reward model to address reward hacking, however, they often lack systematic or theoretical foundations, failing to model the uncertainty intrinsically emerging from preference data, thus cannot sufficiently mitigate reward hacking to sustain prolonged RLHF training and exploration. In this paper, we propose the Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model (PURM), a natural generalization of the classical Bradley-Terry reward model, that directly model the reward distribution emerged from the preference data. We theoretically derived PURM's loss function and the reward distribution uncertainty calculation based on Bhattacharyya Coefficient. To mitigate reward hacking with PURM, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware penalty into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which leverages the learned uncertainty to dynamically balance reward optimization and exploration. We propose a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of PURM. Experiments demonstrate that PURM significantly delays the onset of reward hacking while improving final reward performance, outperforming baseline methods in both stability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Momentum Boosted Episodic Memory for Improving Learning in Long-Tailed RL Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05840v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms assume the distribution of the data to be uniform or mostly uniform. However, this is not the case with most real-world applications like autonomous driving or in nature where animals roam. Some experiences are encountered frequently, and most of the remaining experiences occur rarely; the resulting distribution is called Zipfian. Taking inspiration from the theory of complementary learning systems, an architecture for learning from Zipfian distributions is proposed where important long tail trajectories are discovered in an unsupervised manner. The proposal comprises an episodic memory buffer containing a prioritised memory module to ensure important rare trajectories are kept longer to address the Zipfian problem, which needs credit assignment to happen in a sample efficient manner. The experiences are then reinstated from episodic memory and given weighted importance forming the trajectory to be executed. Notably, the proposed architecture is modular, can be incorporated in any RL architecture and yields improved performance in multiple Zipfian tasks over traditional architectures. Our method outperforms IMPALA by a significant margin on all three tasks and all three evaluation metrics (Zipfian, Uniform, and Rare Accuracy) and also gives improvements on most Atari environments that are considered challenging</p></details> |  |

However, these approaches critically depend on external supervisions--such as human labelled reasoning traces, verified golden answers, or pre-trained reward models--which limits scalability and practical applicability. In this work, we propose Entropy Minimized Policy Optimization (EMPO), which makes an early attempt at fully unsupervised LLM reasoning incentivization. EMPO does not require any supervised information for incentivizing reasoning capabilities (i.e., neither verifiable reasoning traces, problems with golden answers, nor additional pre-trained reward models). By continuously minimizing the predictive entropy of LLMs on unlabeled user queries in a latent semantic space, EMPO enables purely self-supervised evolution of reasoning capabilities with strong flexibility and practicality. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance of EMPO on both mathematical reasoning and free-form commonsense reasoning tasks. Specifically, without any supervised signals, EMPO boosts the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Math-7B Base from 30.7\% to 48.1\% on mathematical benchmarks and improves truthfulness accuracy of Qwen2.5-7B Instruct from 87.16\% to 97.25\% on TruthfulQA.</p></details> | Ongoing work |

However, accumulated model errors during these rollouts can distort the data distribution, negatively impacting policy learning and hindering long-term planning. Thus, the accumulation of model errors is a key bottleneck in current MBRL methods. We propose Infoprop, a model-based rollout mechanism that separates aleatoric from epistemic model uncertainty and reduces the influence of the latter on the data distribution. Further, Infoprop keeps track of accumulated model errors along a model rollout and provides termination criteria to limit data corruption. We demonstrate the capabilities of Infoprop in the Infoprop-Dyna algorithm, reporting state-of-the-art performance in Dyna-style MBRL on common MuJoCo benchmark tasks while substantially increasing rollout length and data quality.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, a range of crucial robotics-related tasks, such as multi-robot pathfinding, which have traditionally been approached with classical non-learnable methods (e.g., heuristic search), are now being suggested for solution using learning-based or hybrid methods. However, in this domain, it remains difficult, if not impossible, to conduct a fair comparison between classical, learning-based, and hybrid approaches due to the lack of a unified framework that supports both learning and evaluation. To address this, we introduce POGEMA, a comprehensive set of tools that includes a fast environment for learning, a problem instance generator, a collection of predefined problem instances, a visualization toolkit, and a benchmarking tool for automated evaluation. We also introduce and define an evaluation protocol that specifies a range of domain-related metrics, computed based on primary evaluation indicators (such as success rate and path length), enabling a fair multi-fold comparison.

Solving MAPF optimally, even under restrictive assumptions, is NP-hard, yet efficient solutions for this problem are critical for numerous applications, such as automated warehouses and transportation systems. Recently, learning-based approaches to MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep reinforcement learning. Typically, such learning-based MAPF solvers are augmented with additional components like single-agent planning or communication. Orthogonally, in this work we rely solely on imitation learning that leverages a large dataset of expert MAPF solutions and transformer-based neural network to create a foundation model for MAPF called MAPF-GPT. The latter is capable of generating actions without additional heuristics or communication. MAPF-GPT demonstrates zero-shot learning abilities when solving the MAPF problems that are not present in the training dataset. We show that MAPF-GPT notably outperforms the current best-performing learnable MAPF solvers on a diverse range of problem instances and is computationally efficient during inference.</p></details> |  |

Both processes demand an intricate understanding of advanced technical domain knowledge. Existing large language models (LLMs), while possessing massive pre-trained knowledge, often fall short in the innovative concept generation due to a lack of specialized knowledge necessary for the generation. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a novel knowledge finetuning (KFT) framework to endow LLM-based AI with the ability to autonomously mine, understand, and apply domain-specific knowledge and concepts for invention generation, i.e., concept and patent generation together. Our proposed PatentGPT integrates knowledge injection pre-training (KPT), domain-specific supervised finetuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Extensive evaluation shows that PatentGPT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models on patent-related benchmark tests.

A typical recommender system handling multiple types of feedback has two components: a multi-task learning (MTL) module, predicting feedback such as click-through rate and like rate; and a multi-task fusion (MTF) module, integrating these predictions into a single score for item ranking. MTF is essential for ensuring user satisfaction, as it directly influences recommendation outcomes. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to MTF tasks to improve long-term user satisfaction. However, existing RL-based MTF methods are formula-based methods, which only adjust limited coefficients within pre-defined formulas. The pre-defined formulas restrict the RL search space and become a bottleneck for MTF. To overcome this, we propose a formula-free MTF framework. We demonstrate that any suitable fusion function can be expressed as a composition of single-variable monotonic functions, as per the Sprecher Representation Theorem. Leveraging this, we introduce a novel learnable monotonic fusion cell (MFC) to replace pre-defined formulas. We call this new MFC-based model eXtreme MTF (xMTF). Furthermore, we employ a two-stage hybrid (TSH) learning strategy to train xMTF effectively. By expanding the MTF search space, xMTF outperforms existing methods in extensive offline and online experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figues; WWW 2025 Accepted</p></details> |

The use of hyperproperties is motivated by their significant power to formally specify requirements of multi-agent systems as well as those that need expressiveness in terms of multiple execution traces (e.g., privacy and fairness). Given a Markov decision process M with unknown transitions (representing the environment) and a HyperLTL formula $\varphi$, our approach first employs Skolemization to handle quantifier alternations in $\varphi$. We introduce quantitative robustness functions for HyperLTL to define rewards of finite traces of M with respect to $\varphi$. Finally, we utilize a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm to learn (1) a policy per trace quantifier in $\varphi$, and (2) the probability distribution of transitions of M that together maximize the expected reward and, hence, probability of satisfaction of $\varphi$ in M.

This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in evaluating and enhancing multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Focusing on task-specific scenarios, from instruction following in diverse domains such as math and coding to complex conversational engagements in roleplay, healthcare, education, and even adversarial jailbreak settings, we systematically examine the challenges of maintaining context, coherence, fairness, and responsiveness over prolonged dialogues. The paper organizes current benchmarks and datasets into coherent categories that reflect the evolving landscape of multi-turn dialogue evaluation. In addition, we review a range of enhancement methodologies under multi-turn settings, including model-centric strategies (contextual learning, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and new architectures), external integration approaches (memory-augmented, retrieval-based methods, and knowledge graph), and agent-based techniques for collaborative interactions. Finally, we discuss open challenges and propose future directions for research to further advance the robustness and effectiveness of multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Related resources and papers are available at https://github.com/yubol-cmu/Awesome-Multi-Turn-LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of RL in social reasoning, particularly in Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' mental states, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that RL methods effectively unlock ToM reasoning capabilities even in small-scale LLMs (0.5B to 7B parameters). Using a modest dataset comprising 3200 questions across diverse scenarios, our RL-trained 7B model achieves 84.50\% accuracy on the Hi-ToM benchmark, surpassing models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-v3 despite significantly fewer parameters. While smaller models ($\leq$3B parameters) suffer from reasoning collapse, larger models (7B parameters) maintain stable performance through consistent belief tracking. Additionally, our RL-based models demonstrate robust generalization to higher-order, out-of-distribution ToM problems, novel textual presentations, and previously unseen datasets. These findings highlight RL's potential to enhance social cognitive reasoning, bridging the gap between structured problem-solving and nuanced social inference in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Although traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been shown to be promising, their effectiveness is hindered by a reliance on manually designed reward functions and inefficiencies in dynamic environments. In this paper, an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework is proposed, in which multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and graph attention mechanisms are incorporated to enhance reward function learning and task execution efficiency. Expert demonstrations are utilized to infer optimal reward densities, allowing dependence on handcrafted designs to be reduced and adaptability to be improved. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method over widely used multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in terms of both cumulative rewards and task execution efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added a clarification on the source of expert trajectories in Section V</p></details> |

However, not all of these start-ups have succeeded due to various reasons, among others, not being able to establish a large enough customer base. In this paper, we address this problem that many on-demand transportation start-ups face: how to establish themselves in a new market. When starting, such companies often have limited fleet resources to serve demand across a city. Depending on the use of the fleet, varying service quality is observed in different areas of the city, and in turn, the service quality impacts the respective growth of demand in each area. Thus, operational fulfillment decisions drive the longer-term demand development. To integrate strategic demand development into real-time fulfillment operations, we propose a two-step approach. First, we derive analytical insights into optimal allocation decisions for a stylized problem. Second, we use these insights to shape the training data of a reinforcement learning strategy for operational real-time fulfillment. Our experiments demonstrate that combining operational efficiency with long-term strategic planning is highly advantageous. Further, we show that the careful shaping of training data is essential for the successful development of demand.</p></details> |  |
| **[PTRL: Prior Transfer Deep Reinforcement Learning for Legged Robots Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05629v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of legged robot motion control, reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise but faces two major challenges: high computational cost for training individual robots and poor generalization of trained models. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel framework called Prior Transfer Reinforcement Learning (PTRL), which improves both training efficiency and model transferability across different robots. Drawing inspiration from model transfer techniques in deep learning, PTRL introduces a fine-tuning mechanism that selectively freezes layers of the policy network during transfer, making it the first to apply such a method in RL. The framework consists of three stages: pre-training on a source robot using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, transferring the learned policy to a target robot, and fine-tuning with partial network freezing. Extensive experiments on various robot platforms confirm that this approach significantly reduces training time while maintaining or even improving performance. Moreover, the study quantitatively analyzes how the ratio of frozen layers affects transfer results, providing valuable insights into optimizing the process. The experimental outcomes show that PTRL achieves better walking control performance and demonstrates strong generalization and adaptability, offering a promising solution for efficient and scalable RL-based control of legged robots.</p></details> |  |

While traditional practices involve hiring human caregivers to serve meals and attend to basic needs, older adults often require continuous companionship and health monitoring. However, hiring human caregivers for this job costs a lot of money. However, using a robot like Nao could be cheaper and still helpful. This study explores the integration of humanoid robots, particularly Nao, in health monitoring and caregiving for older adults. Using a mixed-methods approach with a within-subject factorial design, we investigated the effectiveness of nonverbal communication modalities, including touch, gestures, and LED patterns, in enhancing human-robot interactions. Our results indicate that Nao's touch-based health monitoring was well-received by participants, with positive ratings across various dimensions. LED patterns were perceived as more effective and accurate compared to hand and head gestures. Moreover, longer interactions were associated with higher trust levels and perceived empathy, highlighting the importance of prolonged engagement in fostering trust in human-robot interactions. Despite limitations, our study contributes valuable insights into the potential of humanoid robots to improve health monitoring and caregiving for older adults.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The dataset in this manuscript was created for purpose of class project (pretend) and I did not take the ethical review board's permission.

| **[Execution Semantics of Behavior Trees in Robotic Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00090v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behavior Trees (BTs) have found a widespread adoption in robotics due to appealing features, their ease of use as a conceptual model of control policies and the availability of software tooling for BT-based design of control software. However, BTs don't have formal execution semantics and, furthermore, subtle differences among implementations can make the same model behave differently depending on the underlying software. This paper aims at defining the execution semantics of behavior trees (BTs) as used in robotics applications. To this purpose, we present an abstract data type that formalizes the structure and execution of BTs. While our formalization is inspired by existing contributions in the scientific literature and state-of-the art implementations, we strive to provide an unambiguous treatment of most features that find incomplete or inconsistent treatment across other works.</p></details> | 25 pages, 2 figures |

By now, research on RPA has spread into multiple research streams. This study aims to create a science map of RPA and its aspects by revealing latent topics related to RPA, their research interest, impact, and time development. We provide a systematic framework that is helpful to develop further research into this technology.

| **[Efficient Swept Volume-Based Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary-Shaped Ground Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07554v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating an arbitrary-shaped ground robot safely in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem. The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extended URDF: Accounting for parallel mechanism in robot description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04767v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic designs played an important role in recent advances by providing powerful robots with complex mechanics. Many recent systems rely on parallel actuation to provide lighter limbs and allow more complex motion. However, these emerging architectures fall outside the scope of most used description formats, leading to difficulties when designing, storing, and sharing the models of these systems. This paper introduces an extension to the widely used Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) to support closed-loop kinematic structures. Our approach relies on augmenting URDF with minimal additional information to allow more efficient modeling of complex robotic systems while maintaining compatibility with existing design and simulation frameworks. This method sets the basic requirement for a description format to handle parallel mechanisms efficiently. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by providing an open-source collection of parallel robots, along with tools for generating and parsing this extended description format. The proposed extension simplifies robot modeling, reduces redundancy, and improves usability for advanced robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

The overall cost function balances the need for the robots to be close together for good ranging-based relative localization accuracy and the need for the robots to achieve specific tasks, such as minimizing the time taken to inspect a given area. The formations found by minimizing the aggregated cost function are evaluated in a coverage path planning task in simulation and experiment, where the robots localize themselves and unknown landmarks using a simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter. Compared to an optimal formation that maximizes ranging-based relative localization accuracy, these formations significantly reduce the time to cover a given area with minimal impact on relative pose estimation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, submitted to IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems 2024</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Vision-Guided Robotic Arm Control for Precision Pruning in Dynamic Orchard Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07309v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a vision-guided robotic control system for automated fruit tree pruning applications. Traditional agricultural practices rely on labor-intensive tasks and processes that lack scalability and efficiency, creating a pressing need for automation research to address growing demands for higher crop yields, scalable operations, and reduced manual labor. To this end, this paper proposes a novel algorithm for robust and automated fruit pruning in dense orchards. The proposed algorithm utilizes CoTracker, that is designed to track 2D feature points in video sequences with significant robustness and accuracy, while leveraging joint attention mechanisms to account for inter-point dependencies, enabling robust and precise tracking under challenging and sophisticated conditions. To validate the efficacy of CoTracker, a Universal Robots manipulator UR5e is employed in a Gazebo simulation environment mounted on ClearPath Robotics Warthog robot featuring an Intel RealSense D435 camera. The system achieved a 93% success rate in pruning trials and with an average end trajectory error of 0.23 mm. The vision controller demonstrated robust performance in handling occlusions and maintaining stable trajectories as the arm move towards the target point. The results validate the effectiveness of integrating vision-based tracking with kinematic control for precision agricultural tasks. Future work will focus on real-world implementation and the integration of 3D reconstruction techniques for enhanced adaptability in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Enabled Neighboring Extremal: Case Study on Model-Free Trajectory Tracking for Robotic Arm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07292v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) has recently emerged as a powerful data-driven approach for efficient system controls with constraints handling capabilities. It performs optimal controls by directly harnessing input-output (I/O) data, bypassing the process of explicit model identification that can be costly and time-consuming. However, its high computational complexity, driven by a large-scale optimization problem (typically in a higher dimension than its model-based counterpart--Model Predictive Control), hinders real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose the data-enabled neighboring extremal (DeeNE) framework, which significantly reduces computational cost while preserving control performance. DeeNE leverages first-order optimality perturbation analysis to efficiently update a precomputed nominal DeePC solution in response to changes in initial conditions and reference trajectories. We validate its effectiveness on a 7-DoF KINOVA Gen3 robotic arm, demonstrating substantial computational savings and robust, data-driven control performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expectations, Explanations, and Embodiment: Attempts at Robot Failure Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07266v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expectations critically shape how people form judgments about robots, influencing whether they view failures as minor technical glitches or deal-breaking flaws. This work explores how high and low expectations, induced through brief video priming, affect user perceptions of robot failures and the utility of explanations in HRI. We conducted two online studies ($N=600$ total participants); each replicated two robots with different embodiments, Furhat and Pepper. In our first study, grounded in expectation theory, participants were divided into two groups, one primed with positive and the other with negative expectations regarding the robot's performance, establishing distinct expectation frameworks. This validation study aimed to verify whether the videos could reliably establish low and high-expectation profiles. In the second study, participants were primed using the validated videos and then viewed a new scenario in which the robot failed at a task. Half viewed a version where the robot explained its failure, while the other half received no explanation. We found that explanations significantly improved user perceptions of Furhat, especially when participants were primed to have lower expectations. Explanations boosted satisfaction and enhanced the robot's perceived expressiveness, indicating that effectively communicating the cause of errors can help repair user trust. By contrast, Pepper's explanations produced minimal impact on user attitudes, suggesting that a robot's embodiment and style of interaction could determine whether explanations can successfully offset negative impressions. Together, these findings underscore the need to consider users' expectations when tailoring explanation strategies in HRI. When expectations are initially low, a cogent explanation can make the difference between dismissing a failure and appreciating the robot's transparency and effort to communicate.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks and datasets predominantly focus on assembling geometric fragments or factory parts, which fall short in addressing the complexities of everyday object interactions and assemblies. To bridge this gap, we present 2BY2, a large-scale annotated dataset for daily pairwise objects assembly, covering 18 fine-grained tasks that reflect real-life scenarios, such as plugging into sockets, arranging flowers in vases, and inserting bread into toasters. 2BY2 dataset includes 1,034 instances and 517 pairwise objects with pose and symmetry annotations, requiring approaches that align geometric shapes while accounting for functional and spatial relationships between objects. Leveraging the 2BY2 dataset, we propose a two-step SE(3) pose estimation method with equivariant features for assembly constraints. Compared to previous shape assembly methods, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 18 tasks in the 2BY2 dataset. Additionally, robot experiments further validate the reliability and generalization ability of our method for complex 3D assembly tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 (Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)</p></details> |
| **[A Centralized Planning and Distributed Execution Method for Shape Filling with Homogeneous Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22522v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nature has inspired humans in different ways. The formation behavior of animals can perform tasks that exceed individual capability. For example, army ants could transverse gaps by forming bridges, and fishes could group up to protect themselves from predators. The pattern formation task is essential in a multiagent robotic system because it usually serves as the initial configuration of downstream tasks, such as collective manipulation and adaptation to various environments. The formation of complex shapes, especially hollow shapes, remains an open question. Traditional approaches either require global coordinates for each robot or are prone to failure when attempting to close the hole due to accumulated localization errors. Inspired by the ribbon idea introduced in the additive self-assembly algorithm by the Kilobot team, we develop a two-stage algorithm that does not require global coordinates information and effectively forms shapes with holes. In this paper, we investigate the partitioning of the shape using ribbons in a hexagonal lattice setting and propose the add-subtract algorithm based on the movement sequence induced by the ribbon structure. This advancement opens the door to tasks requiring complex pattern formations, such as the assembly of nanobots for medical applications involving intricate structures and the deployment of robots along the boundaries of areas of interest. We also provide simulation results on complex shapes, an analysis of the robustness as well as a proof of correctness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Human-Robot Collaborative Missions using Hybrid Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06746v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Producing robust task plans in human-robot collaborative missions is a critical activity in order to increase the likelihood of these missions completing successfully. Despite the broad research body in the area, which considers different classes of constraints and uncertainties, its applicability is confined to relatively simple problems that can be comfortably addressed by the underpinning mathematically-based or heuristic-driven solver engines. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that effectively solves the task planning problem by decomposing it into two intertwined parts, starting with the identification of a feasible plan and followed by its uncertainty augmentation and verification yielding a set of Pareto optimal plans. To enhance its robustness, adaptation tactics are devised for the evolving system requirements and agents' capabilities. We demonstrate our approach through an industrial case study involving workers and robots undertaking activities within a vineyard, showcasing the benefits of our hybrid approach both in the generation of feasible solutions and scalability compared to native planners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Software Reconfiguration in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01039v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots often need to be reconfigurable$-$to customize, calibrate, or optimize robots operating in varying environments with different hardware). A particular challenge in robotics is the automated and dynamic reconfiguration to load and unload software components, as well as parameterizing them. Over the last decades, a large variety of software reconfiguration techniques has been presented in the literature, many specifically for robotics systems. Also many robotics frameworks support reconfiguration. Unfortunately, there is a lack of empirical data on the actual use of reconfiguration techniques in real robotics projects and on their realization in robotics frameworks. To advance reconfiguration techniques and support their adoption, we need to improve our empirical understanding of them in practice. We present a study of automated reconfiguration at runtime in the robotics domain. We determine the state-of-the art by reviewing 78 relevant publications on reconfiguration. We determine the state-of-practice by analyzing how four major robotics frameworks support reconfiguration, and how reconfiguration is realized in 48 robotics (sub-)systems. We contribute a detailed analysis of the design space of reconfiguration techniques. We identify trends and research gaps. Our results show a significant discrepancy between the state-of-the-art and the state-of-practice. While the scientific community focuses on complex structural reconfiguration, only parameter reconfiguration is widely used in practice. Our results support practitioners to realize reconfiguration in robotics systems, as well as they support researchers and tool builders to create more effective reconfiguration techniques that are adopted in practice.</p></details> |  |

Social robots seemingly have the potential to positively shape group interactions, but it seems difficult to effect such impact by designing robot behaviors solely based on related (human interaction) literature. In this article, we take a user-centered approach to explore how teenagers envisage a social robot "group assistant". We engaged 16 teenagers in focus groups, interviews, and robot testing to capture their views and reflections about robots for groups. Over the course of a two-week summer school, participants co-designed the action space for such a robot and experienced working with/wizarding it for 10+ hours. This experience further altered and deepened their insights into using robots as group assistants. We report results regarding teenagers' views on the applicability and use of a robot group assistant, how these expectations evolved throughout the study, and their repeat interactions with the robot. Our results indicate that each group moves on a spectrum of need for the robot, reflected in use of the robot more (or less) for ice-breaking, turn-taking, and fun-making as the situation demanded.</p></details> |  |

However, such representations fail to capture higher-order collaborations, limiting effectiveness in complex tasks. While hypergraph-based approaches enhance cooperation, existing methods often generate arbitrary hypergraph structures and lack adaptability to environmental uncertainties. To address these challenges, we propose the Skewness-Driven Hypergraph Network (SDHN), which employs stochastic Bernoulli hyperedges to explicitly model higher-order multi-robot interactions. By introducing a skewness loss, SDHN promotes an efficient structure with Small-Hyperedge Dominant Hypergraph, allowing robots to prioritize localized synchronization while still adhering to the overall information, similar to human coordination. Extensive experiments on Moving Agents in Formation and Robotic Warehouse tasks validate SDHN's effectiveness, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing AR systems require expert supervision and do not account for differences in the mentor and mentee robot configurations. To enable novices to train outside the operating room while receiving expert-informed guidance, we present dV-STEAR: an open-source system that plays back task-aligned expert demonstrations without assuming identical setup joint positions between expert and novice. Pose estimation was rigorously quantified, showing a registration error of 3.86 (SD=2.01)mm. In a user study (N=24), dV-STEAR significantly improved novice performance on tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery. In a single-handed ring-over-wire task, dV-STEAR increased completion speed (p=0.03) and reduced collision time (p=0.01) compared to dry-lab training alone. During a pick-and-place task, it improved success rates (p=0.004). Across both tasks, participants using dV-STEAR exhibited significantly more balanced hand use and reported lower frustration levels. This work presents a novel educational tool implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, demonstrates its effectiveness in teaching novices, and builds the foundation for further AR integration into robot-assisted surgery.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures; Open-source code, see https://github.com/AlexandreBanks6/dV-STEAR_Public.git; Supplementary movies, see https://github.com/AlexandreBanks6/dVSTEAR_Supplemental_Files.git</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a collaborative shelf-picking framework that combines multimodal interaction, physics-based reasoning, and task division for enhanced human-robot teamwork. The framework enables the robot to recognize human pointing gestures, interpret verbal cues and voice commands, and communicate through visual and auditory feedback. Moreover, it is powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) which utilizes Chain of Thought (CoT) and a physics-based simulation engine for safely retrieving cluttered stacks of boxes on shelves, relationship graph for sub-task generation, extraction sequence planning and decision making. Furthermore, we validate the framework through real-world shelf picking experiments such as 1) Gesture-Guided Box Extraction, 2) Collaborative Shelf Clearing and 3) Collaborative Stability Assistance.</p></details> |  |

While most existing sensor-fusion approaches are designed for specific scenarios, this work introduces a flexible open-source solution for task- and setup-agnostic multimodal sensor fusion that is distinguished by its generality and usability. Holistic Fusion formulates sensor fusion as a combined estimation problem of i) the local and global robot state and ii) a (theoretically unlimited) number of dynamic context variables, including automatic alignment of reference frames; this formulation fits countless real-world applications without any conceptual modifications. The proposed factor-graph solution enables the direct fusion of an arbitrary number of absolute, local, and landmark measurements expressed with respect to different reference frames by explicitly including them as states in the optimization and modeling their evolution as random walks. Moreover, local smoothness and consistency receive particular attention to prevent jumps in the robot state belief.

| **[Semantically Safe Robot Manipulation: From Semantic Scene Understanding to Motion Safeguards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15185v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safe interactions in human-centric environments requires robots to understand and adhere to constraints recognized by humans as "common sense" (e.g., "moving a cup of water above a laptop is unsafe as the water may spill" or "rotating a cup of water is unsafe as it can lead to pouring its content"). Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning have enabled robots to acquire a semantic understanding of and reason about their operating environments. While extensive literature on safe robot decision-making exists, semantic understanding is rarely integrated into these formulations. In this work, we propose a semantic safety filter framework to certify robot inputs with respect to semantically defined constraints (e.g., unsafe spatial relationships, behaviors, and poses) and geometrically defined constraints (e.g., environment-collision and self-collision constraints). In our proposed approach, given perception inputs, we build a semantic map of the 3D environment and leverage the contextual reasoning capabilities of large language models to infer semantically unsafe conditions. These semantically unsafe conditions are then mapped to safe actions through a control barrier certification formulation. We demonstrate the proposed semantic safety filter in teleoperated manipulation tasks and with learned diffusion policies applied in a real-world kitchen environment that further showcases its effectiveness in addressing practical semantic safety constraints. Together, these experiments highlight our approach's capability to integrate semantics into safety certification, enabling safe robot operation beyond traditional collision avoidance.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Accurately assessing an operator's mental state is critical for maintaining performance and well-being. We use subjective time perception, which can be altered by stress and cognitive load, as a sensitive, low-latency indicator of well-being and cognitive strain. Distortions in time perception can affect decision-making, reaction times, and overall task effectiveness, making it a valuable metric for adaptive human-swarm interaction systems. We study how human physiological signals can be used to estimate a person's subjective time perception in a human-swarm interaction scenario as example. A human operator needs to guide and control a swarm of small mobile robots. We obtain eye-tracking data that is classified for subjective time perception based on questionnaire data. Our results show that we successfully estimate a person's time perception from eye-tracking data. The approach can profit from individual-based pretraining using only 30 seconds of data. In future work, we aim for robots that respond to human operator needs by automatically classifying physiological data in a closed control loop.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

We formalize CL-MRMP as a chance-constrained motion planning problem, and propose a safety-guaranteed algorithm that explicitly accounts for robot-robot correlations. Our approach extends a sampling-based planner to solve CL-MRMP while preserving probabilistic completeness. To improve efficiency, we introduce novel biasing techniques. We evaluate our method across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating motion plans, with significant performance gains from biasing strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

In this study, we analysed conversational data from three controlled experiments in which participants self-disclosed to a human, a humanoid social robot, and a disembodied conversational agent. Using sentence embeddings and clustering, we identified themes in participants' disclosures, which were then labelled and explained by a large language model. We subsequently assessed whether these themes and the underlying semantic structure of the disclosures varied by agent embodiment. Our findings reveal strong consistency: thematic distributions did not significantly differ across embodiments, and semantic similarity analyses showed that disclosures were expressed in highly comparable ways. These results suggest that while embodiment may influence human behaviour in human-robot and human-agent interactions, people tend to maintain a consistent thematic focus and semantic structure in their disclosures, whether speaking to humans or artificial interlocutors.</p></details> |  |

However, selecting the most appropriate underwater robotic simulator (URS) remains a challenge due to wide variations in fidelity, extensibility, and task suitability. This paper presents a comprehensive review and comparative analysis of five state-of-the-art, ROS-compatible, open-source URSs: Stonefish, DAVE, HoloOcean, MARUS, and UNav-Sim. Each simulator is evaluated across multiple criteria including sensor fidelity, environmental realism, sim-to-real capabilities, and research impact. We evaluate them across architectural design, sensor and physics modeling, task capabilities, and research impact. Additionally, we discuss ongoing challenges in sim-to-real transfer and highlight the need for standardization and benchmarking in the field. Our findings aim to guide practitioners in selecting effective simulation environments and inform future development of more robust and transferable URSs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[4CNet: A Diffusion Approach to Map Prediction for Decentralized Multi-Robot Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17904v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robots in unknown cluttered environments with irregularly shaped obstacles often face energy and communication challenges which directly affect their ability to explore these environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, Confidence-Aware Contrastive Conditional Consistency Model (4CNet), for robot map prediction during decentralized, resource-limited multi-robot exploration. 4CNet uniquely incorporates: 1) a conditional consistency model for map prediction in unstructured unknown regions, 2) a contrastive map-trajectory pretraining framework for a trajectory encoder that extracts spatial information from the trajectories of nearby robots during map prediction, and 3) a confidence network to measure the uncertainty of map prediction for effective exploration under resource constraints. We incorporate 4CNet within our proposed robot exploration with map prediction architecture, 4CNet-E. We then conduct extensive comparison studies with 4CNet-E and state-of-the-art heuristic and learning methods to investigate both map prediction and exploration performance in environments consisting of irregularly shaped obstacles and uneven terrain. Results showed that 4CNet-E obtained statistically significant higher prediction accuracy and area coverage with varying environment sizes, number of robots, energy budgets, and communication limitations when compared to database and learning-based methods. Hardware experiments were performed and validated the applicability and generalizability of 4CNet-E in both unstructured indoor and real natural outdoor environments.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |

We combine principles from Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Universal Design (UD) with symbolic communication strategies to facilitate the alignment of mental models between humans and robots. Our approach employs Asterics Grid and ARASAAC pictograms as a multimodal, interpretable front-end, integrated with a lightweight HTTP-to-ROS 2 bridge that enables real-time interaction and explanation triggering. We emphasize that explainability is not a one-way function but a bidirectional process, where human understanding and robot transparency must co-evolve. We further argue that in educational or assistive contexts, the role of a human mediator (e.g., a teacher) may be essential to support shared understanding. We validate our framework with examples of multimodal explanation boards and discuss how it can be extended to different scenarios in education, assistive robotics, and inclusive AI.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[GRAPPA: Generalizing and Adapting Robot Policies via Online Agentic Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06473v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning approaches such as behavior cloning and reinforcement learning have shown great promise in synthesizing robot skills from human demonstrations in specific environments. However, these approaches often require task-specific demonstrations or designing complex simulation environments, which limits the development of generalizable and robust policies for unseen real-world settings. Recent advances in the use of foundation models for robotics (e.g., LLMs, VLMs) have shown great potential in enabling systems to understand the semantics in the world from large-scale internet data. However, it remains an open challenge to use this knowledge to enable robotic systems to understand the underlying dynamics of the world, to generalize policies across different tasks, and to adapt policies to new environments. To alleviate these limitations, we propose an agentic framework for robot self-guidance and self-improvement, which consists of a set of role-specialized conversational agents, such as a high-level advisor, a grounding agent, a monitoring agent, and a robotic agent. Our framework iteratively grounds a base robot policy to relevant objects in the environment and uses visuomotor cues to shift the action distribution of the policy to more desirable states, online, while remaining agnostic to the subjective configuration of a given robot hardware platform. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide manipulation policies to achieve significantly higher success rates, both in simulation and in real-world experiments, without the need for additional human demonstrations or extensive exploration.

Toward such a socially acceptable Human-Robot Interaction, we conducted a study ($N=24$) in an AR-simulated context of a coffee chat. Participants elicited social cues to signal intentions to an anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, grounded technical, or aerial technical robot waiter when they were speakers or listeners. Our findings reveal common patterns of social cues over intentions, the effects of robot morphology on social cue position and conversational role on social cue complexity, and users' rationale in choosing social cues. We offer insights into understanding social cues concerning perceptions of robots, cognitive load, and social context. Additionally, we discuss design considerations on approaching, social cue recognition, and response strategies for future service robots.</p></details> | CHI '25 |

Solving such dexterous manipulation tasks often relies on imitation learning from demonstration datasets, which are typically collected via teleoperation systems and often demand substantial time and effort. To address these challenges, we present ViTaMIn, an embodiment-free manipulation interface that seamlessly integrates visual and tactile sensing into a hand-held gripper, enabling data collection without the need for teleoperation. Our design employs a compliant Fin Ray gripper with tactile sensing, allowing operators to perceive force feedback during manipulation for more intuitive operation. Additionally, we propose a multimodal representation learning strategy to obtain pre-trained tactile representations, improving data efficiency and policy robustness. Experiments on seven contact-rich manipulation tasks demonstrate that ViTaMIn significantly outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for complex manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Adversarial Obstacle Attacks in Search-based Path Planning for Autonomous Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06154v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Path planning algorithms, such as the search-based A*, are a critical component of autonomous mobile robotics, enabling robots to navigate from a starting point to a destination efficiently and safely. We investigated the resilience of the A* algorithm in the face of potential adversarial interventions known as obstacle attacks. The adversary's goal is to delay the robot's timely arrival at its destination by introducing obstacles along its original path. We developed malicious software to execute the attacks and conducted experiments to assess their impact, both in simulation using TurtleBot in Gazebo and in real-world deployment with the Unitree Go1 robot. In simulation, the attacks resulted in an average delay of 36\%, with the most significant delays occurring in scenarios where the robot was forced to take substantially longer alternative paths. In real-world experiments, the delays were even more pronounced, with all attacks successfully rerouting the robot and causing measurable disruptions. These results highlight that the algorithm's robustness is not solely an attribute of its design but is significantly influenced by the operational environment. For example, in constrained environments like tunnels, the delays were maximized due to the limited availability of alternative routes.</p></details> |  |

These images, the precursors to modern satellite imagery, represent an extraordinary visual record of the environmental and social upheavals of the 20th Century. However, most of these images currently languish in physical archives where retrieval is difficult and costly. Digitization could revolutionize access, but manual scanning is slow and expensive. Here, we describe and validate a novel robot-assisted pipeline that increases worker productivity in scanning 30-fold, applied at scale to digitize an archive of 1.7 million historical aerial photographs from 65 countries.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAPLE: Encoding Dexterous Robotic Manipulation Priors Learned From Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06084v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale egocentric video datasets capture diverse human activities across a wide range of scenarios, offering rich and detailed insights into how humans interact with objects, especially those that require fine-grained dexterous control. Such complex, dexterous skills with precise controls are crucial for many robotic manipulation tasks, yet are often insufficiently addressed by traditional data-driven approaches to robotic manipulation. To address this gap, we leverage manipulation priors learned from large-scale egocentric video datasets to improve policy learning for dexterous robotic manipulation tasks. We present MAPLE, a novel method for dexterous robotic manipulation that exploits rich manipulation priors to enable efficient policy learning and better performance on diverse, complex manipulation tasks. Specifically, we predict hand-object contact points and detailed hand poses at the moment of hand-object contact and use the learned features to train policies for downstream manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MAPLE across existing simulation benchmarks, as well as a newly designed set of challenging simulation tasks, which require fine-grained object control and complex dexterous skills. The benefits of MAPLE are further highlighted in real-world experiments using a dexterous robotic hand, whereas simultaneous evaluation across both simulation and real-world experiments has remained underexplored in prior work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Statistics vs. Machine Learning vs. Bayesian Inference: Insights into Handling Faulty GNSS Measurements in Field Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06015v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents research findings on handling faulty measurements (i.e., outliers) of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) for robot localization under adverse signal conditions in field applications, where raw GNSS data are frequently corrupted due to environmental interference such as multipath, signal blockage, or non-line-of-sight conditions. In this context, we investigate three strategies applied specifically to GNSS pseudorange observations: robust statistics for error mitigation, machine learning for faulty measurement prediction, and Bayesian inference for noise distribution approximation. Since previous studies have provided limited insight into the theoretical foundations and practical evaluations of these three methodologies within a unified problem statement (i.e., state estimation using ranging sensors), we conduct extensive experiments using real-world sensor data collected in diverse urban environments. Our goal is to examine both established techniques and newly proposed methods, thereby advancing the understanding of how to handle faulty range measurements, such as GNSS, for robust, long-term robot localization. In addition to presenting successful results, this work highlights critical observations and open questions to motivate future research in robust state estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Vertex Motion Estimation for Integrated Video Stabilization and Stitching in Tractor-Trailer Wheeled Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07154v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tractor-trailer wheeled robots need to perform comprehensive perception tasks to enhance their operations in areas such as logistics parks and long-haul transportation. The perception of these robots faces three major challenges: the asynchronous vibrations between the tractor and trailer, the relative pose change between the tractor and trailer, and the significant camera parallax caused by the large size. In this paper, we employ the Dual Independence Stabilization Motion Field Estimation method to address asynchronous vibrations between the tractor and trailer, effectively eliminating conflicting motion estimations for the same object in overlapping regions. We utilize the Random Plane-based Stitching Motion Field Estimation method to tackle the continuous relative pose changes caused by the articulated hitch between the tractor and trailer, thus eliminating dynamic misalignment in overlapping regions. Furthermore, we apply the Unified Vertex Motion Estimation method to manage the challenges posed by the tractor-trailer's large physical size, which results in severely low overlapping regions between the tractor and trailer views, thus preventing distortions in overlapping regions from exponentially propagating into non-overlapping areas. Furthermore, this framework has been successfully implemented in real tractor-trailer wheeled robots. The proposed Unified Vertex Motion Video Stabilization and Stitching method has been thoroughly tested in various challenging scenarios, demonstrating its accuracy and practicality in real-world.</p></details> |  |
| **[PTRL: Prior Transfer Deep Reinforcement Learning for Legged Robots Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05629v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of legged robot motion control, reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise but faces two major challenges: high computational cost for training individual robots and poor generalization of trained models. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel framework called Prior Transfer Reinforcement Learning (PTRL), which improves both training efficiency and model transferability across different robots. Drawing inspiration from model transfer techniques in deep learning, PTRL introduces a fine-tuning mechanism that selectively freezes layers of the policy network during transfer, making it the first to apply such a method in RL. The framework consists of three stages: pre-training on a source robot using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, transferring the learned policy to a target robot, and fine-tuning with partial network freezing. Extensive experiments on various robot platforms confirm that this approach significantly reduces training time while maintaining or even improving performance. Moreover, the study quantitatively analyzes how the ratio of frozen layers affects transfer results, providing valuable insights into optimizing the process. The experimental outcomes show that PTRL achieves better walking control performance and demonstrates strong generalization and adaptability, offering a promising solution for efficient and scalable RL-based control of legged robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Formation Shape Control of Identity-less Robot Swarms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23581v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different from most of the formation strategies where robots require unique labels to identify topological neighbors to satisfy the predefined shape constraints, we here study the problem of identity-less distributed shape formation in homogeneous swarms, which is rarely studied in the literature. The absence of identities creates a unique challenge: how to design appropriate target formations and local behaviors that are suitable for identity-less formation shape control. To address this challenge, we propose the following novel results. First, to avoid using unique identities, we propose a dynamic formation description method and solve the formation consensus of robots in a locally distributed manner. Second, to handle identity-less distributed formations, we propose a fully distributed control law for homogeneous swarms based on locally sensed information. While the existing methods are applicable to simple cases where the target formation is stationary, ours can tackle more general maneuvering formations such as translation, rotation, or even shape deformation. Both numerical simulation and flight experiment are presented to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed formation strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lazy-DaSH: Lazy Approach for Hypergraph-based Multi-robot Task and Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05552v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Lazy-DaSH, an improvement over the recent state of the art multi-robot task and motion planning method DaSH, which scales to more than double the number of robots and objects compared to the original method and achieves an order of magnitude faster planning time when applied to a multi-manipulator object rearrangement problem. We achieve this improvement through a hierarchical approach, where a high-level task planning layer identifies planning spaces required for task completion, and motion feasibility is validated lazily only within these spaces. In contrast, DaSH precomputes the motion feasibility of all possible actions, resulting in higher costs for constructing state space representations. Lazy-DaSH maintains efficient query performance by utilizing a constraint feedback mechanism within its hierarchical structure, ensuring that motion feasibility is effectively conveyed to the query process. By maintaining smaller state space representations, our method significantly reduces both representation construction time and query time. We evaluate Lazy-DaSH in four distinct scenarios, demonstrating its scalability to increasing numbers of robots and objects, as well as its adaptability in resolving conflicts through the constraint feedback mechanism.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in low-cost teleoperation devices and VR/AR technologies have expanded accessibility, particularly for bimanual robot manipulators. However, transitioning from in-person to remote teleoperation presents challenges in task performance. We introduce SPARK, a kinematically scaled, low-cost teleoperation system for operating bimanual robots. Its effectiveness is compared to existing technologies like the 3D SpaceMouse and VR/AR controllers. We further extend SPARK to SPARK-Remote, integrating sensor-based force feedback using haptic gloves and a force controller for remote teleoperation. We evaluate SPARK and SPARK-Remote variants on 5 bimanual manipulation tasks which feature operational properties - positional precision, rotational precision, large movements in the workspace, and bimanual collaboration - to test the effective teleoperation modes. Our findings offer insights into improving low-cost teleoperation interfaces for real-world applications.

For this problem class, conventional optimizers suffer from small step sizes and slow convergence. We propose BC-ADMM, a variant of Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM), that can solve a class of non-convex constrained optimizations with biconvex constraint relaxation. Our algorithm allows larger step sizes by breaking the problem into small-scale sub-problems that can be easily solved in parallel. We show that our method has both theoretical convergence speed guarantees and practical convergence guarantees in the asymptotic sense. Through numerical experiments in a row of four robotic applications, we show that BC-ADMM has faster convergence than conventional gradient descent and Newton's method in terms of wall clock time.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Formalisation of the Purpose Framework: the Autonomy-Alignment Problem in Open-Ended Learning Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02514v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unprecedented advancement of artificial intelligence enables the development of increasingly autonomous robots. These robots hold significant potential, particularly in moving beyond engineered factory settings to operate in the unstructured environments inhabited by humans. However, this possibility also generates a relevant autonomy-alignment problem to ensure that robots' autonomous learning processes still focus on acquiring knowledge relevant to accomplish human practical purposes, while their behaviour still aligns with their broader purposes. The literature has only begun to address this problem, and a conceptual, terminological, and formal framework is still lacking. Here we address one of the most challenging instances of the problem: autonomous open-ended learning (OEL) robots, capable of cumulatively acquiring new skills and knowledge through direct interaction with the environment, guided by self-generated goals and intrinsic motivations. In particular, we propose a computational framework, first introduced qualitatively and then formalised, to support the design of OEL robot architectures that balance autonomy and control. The framework pivots on the novel concept of purpose. A human purpose specifies what humans (e.g., designers or users) want the robot to learn, do or not do, within a certain boundary of autonomy and independently of the domains in which it operates.The framework decomposes the autonomy-alignment problem into more tractable sub-problems: the alignment of `robot purposes' with human purposes, either by hardwiring or through learning; the arbitration between multiple purposes; the grounding of purposes into specific domain-dependent robot goals; and the competence acquisition needed to accomplish these goals. The framework and its potential utility are further elucidated through the discussion of hypothetical example scenarios framed within it.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |

One of the promising areas for further exploration lies in human trust. A real-time, objective model of human trust could be used to maximize productivity, preserve safety, and mitigate failure. In this work, we attempt to use physiological measures, gaze, and facial expressions to model human trust in a robot partner. We are the first to design an in-person, human-robot supervisory interaction study to create a dedicated trust dataset. Using this dataset, we train machine learning algorithms to identify the objective measures that are most indicative of trust in a robot partner, advancing trust prediction in human-robot interactions. Our findings indicate that a combination of sensor modalities (blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and gaze) can enhance the accuracy of detecting human trust in a robot partner. Furthermore, the Extra Trees, Random Forest, and Decision Trees classifiers exhibit consistently better performance in measuring the person's trust in the robot partner. These results lay the groundwork for constructing a real-time trust model for human-robot interaction, which could foster more efficient interactions between humans and robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2025</p></details> |

We emphasize the interplay between perception and motion planning in decision-making by introducing the concept of occupancy queries to quantify the perception requirements for sampling-based motion planners. Sensor and algorithm performance are evaluated using False Negative Rates (FPR) and False Positive Rates (FPR) across various factors such as geometric relationships, object properties, sensor resolution, and environmental conditions. By integrating perception requirements with perception performance, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach is proposed for efficient sensor and algorithm selection and placement. This forms the basis for a co-design optimization that includes the robot body, motion planner, perception pipeline, and computing unit. We refer to this framework for solving the co-design problem of mobile robots as CODEI, short for Co-design of Embodied Intelligence. A case study on developing an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) for urban scenarios provides actionable information for designers, and shows that complex tasks escalate resource demands, with task performance affecting choices of the autonomy stack. The study demonstrates that resource prioritization influences sensor choice: cameras are preferred for cost-effective and lightweight designs, while lidar sensors are chosen for better energy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 33 images, IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Speech-to-Trajectory: Learning Human-Like Verbal Guidance for Robot Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05084v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Full integration of robots into real-life applications necessitates their ability to interpret and execute natural language directives from untrained users. Given the inherent variability in human language, equivalent directives may be phrased differently, yet require consistent robot behavior. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced language understanding, they often falter in handling user phrasing variability, rely on predefined commands, and exhibit unpredictable outputs. This letter introduces the Directive Language Model (DLM), a novel speech-to-trajectory framework that directly maps verbal commands to executable motion trajectories, bypassing predefined phrases. DLM utilizes Behavior Cloning (BC) on simulated demonstrations of human-guided robot motion. To enhance generalization, GPT-based semantic augmentation generates diverse paraphrases of training commands, labeled with the same motion trajectory. DLM further incorporates a diffusion policy-based trajectory generation for adaptive motion refinement and stochastic sampling. In contrast to LLM-based methods, DLM ensures consistent, predictable motion without extensive prompt engineering, facilitating real-time robotic guidance. As DLM learns from trajectory data, it is embodiment-agnostic, enabling deployment across diverse robotic platforms. Experimental results demonstrate DLM's improved command generalization, reduced dependence on structured phrasing, and achievement of human-like motion.</p></details> |  |

CONCERT has been designed to support human activities in construction sites by leveraging two main characteristics: high-power density motors and modularity. In this way, the robot is able to perform a wide range of highly demanding tasks by acting as a co-worker of the human operator or by autonomously executing them following user instructions. Most of its versatility comes from the possibility of rapidly changing its kinematic structure by adding or removing passive or active modules. In this way, the robot can be set up in a vast set of morphologies, consequently changing its workspace and capabilities depending on the task to be executed. In the same way, distal end-effectors can be replaced for the execution of different operations. This paper also includes a full description of the software pipeline employed to automatically discover and deploy the robot morphology. Specifically, depending on the modules installed, the robot updates the kinematic, dynamic, and geometric parameters, taking into account the information embedded in each module. In this way, we demonstrate how the robot can be fully reassembled and made operational in less than ten minutes. We validated the CONCERT robot across different use cases, including drilling, sanding, plastering, and collaborative transportation with obstacle avoidance, all performed in a real construction site scenario. We demonstrated the robot's adaptivity and performance in multiple scenarios characterized by different requirements in terms of power and workspace. CONCERT has been designed and built by the Humanoid and Human-Centered Mechatronics Laboratory (HHCM) at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in the context of the European Project Horizon 2020 CONCERT.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is currently under review at the Journal of Field Robotics.

| **[BayesCPF: Enabling Collective Perception in Robot Swarms with Degrading Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04774v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The collective perception problem -- where a group of robots perceives its surroundings and comes to a consensus on an environmental state -- is a fundamental problem in swarm robotics. Past works studying collective perception use either an entire robot swarm with perfect sensing or a swarm with only a handful of malfunctioning members. A related study proposed an algorithm that does account for an entire swarm of unreliable robots but assumes that the sensor faults are known and remain constant over time. To that end, we build on that study by proposing the Bayes Collective Perception Filter (BayesCPF) that enables robots with continuously degrading sensors to accurately estimate the fill ratio -- the rate at which an environmental feature occurs. Our main contribution is the Extended Kalman Filter within the BayesCPF, which helps swarm robots calibrate for their time-varying sensor degradation. We validate our method across different degradation models, initial conditions, and environments in simulated and physical experiments. Our findings show that, regardless of degradation model assumptions, fill ratio estimation using the BayesCPF is competitive to the case if the true sensor accuracy is known, especially when assumptions regarding the model and initial sensor accuracy levels are preserved.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, existing data collection methods like teleoperation are slow, prone to control delays, and unsuitable for dynamic tasks. In contrast, human natural data, where humans directly perform tasks with tools, offers natural, unstructured interactions that are both efficient and easy to collect. Building on the insight that humans and robots can share the same tools, we propose a framework to transfer tool-use knowledge from human data to robots. Using two RGB cameras, our method generates 3D reconstruction, applies Gaussian splatting for novel view augmentation, employs segmentation models to extract embodiment-agnostic observations, and leverages task-space tool-action representations to train visuomotor policies. We validate our approach on diverse real-world tasks, including meatball scooping, pan flipping, wine bottle balancing, and other complex tasks. Our method achieves a 71\% higher average success rate compared to diffusion policies trained with teleoperation data and reduces data collection time by 77\%, with some tasks solvable only by our framework. Compared to hand-held gripper, our method cuts data collection time by 41\%. Additionally, our method bridges the embodiment gap, improves robustness to variations in camera viewpoints and robot configurations, and generalizes effectively across objects and spatial setups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tool-as-interface.github.io. 17 pages, 14 figures</p></details> |

We consider the scenario where real-time perception feedback (e.g., LiDAR) is used online to construct a local CBF that models local state constraints (e.g., local safety constraints such as obstacles) in the a priori unmapped environment. The approach employs a soft-maximum function to synthesize a single time-varying CBF from the N most recently obtained local CBFs. Next, the input constraints are transformed into controller-state constraints through the use of control dynamics. Then, we use a soft-minimum function to compose the input constraints with the time-varying CBF that models the a priori unmapped environment. This composition yields a single relaxed CBF, which is used in a constrained optimization to obtain an optimal control that satisfies the state and input constraints. The approach is validated through simulations of a nonholonomic ground robot that is equipped with LiDAR and navigates an unmapped environment. The robot successfully navigates the environment while avoiding the a priori unmapped obstacles and satisfying both speed and input constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>The P...</summary><p>The Preprint was submitted to the 2025 Conference on Decision and Control (CDC). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.01458</p></details> |
| **[Development and Experimental Evaluation of a Vibration-Based Adhesion System for Miniature Wall-Climbing Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05351v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, miniature wall-climbing robots have attracted widespread attention due to their significant potential in equipment inspection and in-situ repair applications. Traditional wall-climbing systems typically rely on electromagnetic, electrostatic, vacuum suction, or van der Waals forces for controllable adhesion. However, these conventional methods impose limitations when striving for both a compact design and high-speed mobility. This paper proposes a novel Vibration-Based Adhesion (VBA) technique, which utilizes a flexible disk vibrating near a surface to generate a strong and controllable attractive force without direct contact. By employing an electric motor as the vibration source, the constructed VBA system was experimentally evaluated, achieving an adhesion-to-weight ratio exceeding 51 times. The experimental results demonstrate that this adhesion mechanism not only provides a high normal force but also maintains minimal shear force, making it particularly suitable for high-speed movement and heavy load applications in miniature wall-climbing robots.</p></details> |  |

However, the limited scale and diversity of robot demonstration data pose a significant challenge. Recent research has explored leveraging large-scale human activity data for pre-training, but the substantial morphological differences between humans and robots introduce a significant human-robot domain discrepancy, hindering the generalization of these models to downstream manipulation tasks. To overcome this, we propose a novel adaptation paradigm that leverages readily available paired human-robot video data to bridge the domain gap. Our method employs a human-robot contrastive alignment loss to align the semantics of human and robot videos, adapting pre-trained models to the robot domain in a parameter-efficient manner. Experiments on 20 simulated tasks across two different benchmarks and five real-world tasks demonstrate significant improvements. These results span both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task settings, evaluated using two different pre-trained models. Compared to existing pre-trained models, our adaptation method improves the average success rate by over 7% across multiple tasks on both simulated benchmarks and real-world evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025.

A human-like form factor further enables the use of vast datasets of human-hand interactions. However, the primary bottleneck in dexterous manipulation lies not only in software but arguably even more in hardware. Robotic hands that approach human capabilities are often prohibitively expensive, bulky, or require enterprise-level maintenance, limiting their accessibility for broader research and practical applications. What if the research community could get started with reliable dexterous hands within a day? We present the open-source ORCA hand, a reliable and anthropomorphic 17-DoF tendon-driven robotic hand with integrated tactile sensors, fully assembled in less than eight hours and built for a material cost below 2,000 CHF. We showcase ORCA's key design features such as popping joints, auto-calibration, and tensioning systems that significantly reduce complexity while increasing reliability, accuracy, and robustness. We benchmark the ORCA hand across a variety of tasks, ranging from teleoperation and imitation learning to zero-shot sim-to-real reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate its durability, withstanding more than 10,000 continuous operation cycles - equivalent to approximately 20 hours - without hardware failure, the only constraint being the duration of the experiment itself.

| **[Risk-Aware Robot Control in Dynamic Environments Using Belief Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04097v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety for autonomous robots operating in dynamic environments can be challenging due to factors such as unmodeled dynamics, noisy sensor measurements, and partial observability. To account for these limitations, it is common to maintain a belief distribution over the true state. This belief could be a non-parametric, sample-based representation to capture uncertainty more flexibly. In this paper, we propose a novel form of Belief Control Barrier Functions (BCBFs) specifically designed to ensure safety in dynamic environments under stochastic dynamics and a sample-based belief about the environment state. Our approach incorporates provable concentration bounds on tail risk measures into BCBFs, effectively addressing possible multimodal and skewed belief distributions represented by samples. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates robustness against distributional shifts up to a predefined bound. We validate the effectiveness and real-time performance (approximately 1kHz) of the proposed method through two simulated underwater robotic applications: object tracking and dynamic collision avoidance.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboSpatial: Teaching Spatial Understanding to 2D and 3D Vision-Language Models for Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16537v4)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial understanding is a crucial capability that enables robots to perceive their surroundings, reason about their environment, and interact with it meaningfully. In modern robotics, these capabilities are increasingly provided by vision-language models. However, these models face significant challenges in spatial reasoning tasks, as their training data are based on general-purpose image datasets that often lack sophisticated spatial understanding. For example, datasets frequently do not capture reference frame comprehension, yet effective spatial reasoning requires understanding whether to reason from ego-, world-, or object-centric perspectives. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale dataset for spatial understanding in robotics. It consists of real indoor and tabletop scenes, captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, and annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5k 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, and the pairing of 2D egocentric images with 3D scans makes it both 2D- and 3D- ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robot manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (Oral); Project Website: https://chanh.ee/RoboSpatial</p></details> |

Traditional exploration strategies, such as frontier-based methods, often struggle to efficiently utilize prior knowledge of structural regularities in indoor spaces. To address this limitation, we propose Mapping at First Sense, a lightweight neural network-based approach that predicts unobserved areas in local maps, thereby enhancing exploration efficiency. The core of our method, SenseMapNet, integrates convolutional and transformerbased architectures to infer occluded regions while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time deployment on resourceconstrained robots. Additionally, we introduce SenseMapDataset, a curated dataset constructed from KTH and HouseExpo environments, which facilitates training and evaluation of neural models for indoor exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that SenseMapNet achieves an SSIM (structural similarity) of 0.78, LPIPS (perceptual quality) of 0.68, and an FID (feature distribution alignment) of 239.79, outperforming conventional methods in map reconstruction quality. Compared to traditional frontier-based exploration, our method reduces exploration time by 46.5% (from 2335.56s to 1248.68s) while maintaining a high coverage rate (88%) and achieving a reconstruction accuracy of 88%. The proposed method represents a promising step toward efficient, learning-driven robotic exploration in structured environments.</p></details> |  |

However, retinal motion caused by physiological factors such as respiration and heartbeat significantly impacts precise needle positioning, increasing the risk of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) damage. This paper presents a fully autonomous robotic subretinal injection system that integrates intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) imaging and deep learning-based motion prediction to synchronize needle motion with retinal displacement. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is used to predict internal limiting membrane (ILM) motion, outperforming a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based baseline model. Additionally, a real-time registration framework aligns the needle tip position with the robot's coordinate frame. Then, a dynamic proportional speed control strategy ensures smooth and adaptive needle insertion. Experimental validation in both simulation and ex vivo open-sky porcine eyes demonstrates precise motion synchronization and successful subretinal injections. The experiment achieves a mean tracking error below 16.4 {\mu}m in pre-insertion phases. These results show the potential of AI-driven robotic assistance to improve the safety and accuracy of retinal microsurgery.</p></details> |  |

To enable successful robot operation in such settings, maps must be constructed so that they include semantic information, in addition to geometric information. In this paper, we address the novel problem of semantic exploration, whereby a mobile robot must autonomously explore an environment to fully map both its structure and the semantic appearance of features. We develop a method based on next-best-view exploration, where potential poses are scored based on the semantic features visible from that pose. We explore two alternative methods for sampling potential views and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulation and physical experiments. Automatic creation of high-quality semantic maps can enable robots to better understand and interact with their environments and enable future embodied AI applications to be more easily deployed.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, accurately assessing training performance remains challenging, particularly for real-world applications, as behavior cloning losses often correlate poorly with actual task success. Consequently, researchers resort to success rate metrics derived from costly and time-consuming real-world evaluations, making the identification of optimal policies and detection of overfitting or underfitting impractical. To address these issues, we propose real-is-sim, a novel behavior cloning framework that incorporates a dynamic digital twin (based on Embodied Gaussians) throughout the entire policy development pipeline: data collection, training, and deployment. By continuously aligning the simulated world with the physical world, demonstrations can be collected in the real world with states extracted from the simulator. The simulator enables flexible state representations by rendering image inputs from any viewpoint or extracting low-level state information from objects embodied within the scene. During training, policies can be directly evaluated within the simulator in an offline and highly parallelizable manner. Finally, during deployment, policies are run within the simulator where the real robot directly tracks the simulated robot's joints, effectively decoupling policy execution from real hardware and mitigating traditional domain-transfer challenges. We validate real-is-sim on the PushT manipulation task, demonstrating strong correlation between success rates obtained in the simulator and real-world evaluations. Videos of our system can be found at https://realissim.rai-inst.com.</p></details> |  |

However, human oversight remains crucial. This study compared two touchless methods for directing mobile robots: voice control and gesture control, to investigate the efficiency of the methods and the preference of users. We tested these methods in two conditions: one in which participants remained stationary and one in which they walked freely alongside the robot. We hypothesized that walking alongside the robot would result in higher intuitiveness ratings and improved task performance, based on the idea that walking promotes spatial alignment and reduces the effort required for mental rotation. In a 2x2 within-subject design, 218 participants guided the quadruped robot Spot along a circuitous route with multiple 90-degree turns using rotate left, rotate right, and walk forward commands. After each trial, participants rated the intuitiveness of the command mapping, while post-experiment interviews were used to gather the participants' preferences. Results showed that voice control combined with walking with Spot was the most favored and intuitive, whereas gesture control while standing caused confusion for left/right commands. Nevertheless, 29% of participants preferred gesture control, citing increased task engagement and visual congruence as reasons. An odometry-based analysis revealed that participants often followed behind Spot, particularly in the gesture control condition, when they were allowed to walk. In conclusion, voice control with walking produced the best outcomes. Improving physical ergonomics and adjusting gesture types could make gesture control more effective.</p></details> |  |

For pediatric or elderly individuals, whose vessels are small in size (typically 2 to 3 mm in diameter for adults and less than 1 mm in children), vascular access can be highly challenging. This study presents an image-guided robotic system aimed at enhancing the accuracy of difficult vascular access procedures. The system integrates a 6-DoF robotic arm with a 3-DoF end-effector, ensuring precise navigation and needle insertion. Multi-modal imaging and sensing technologies have been utilized to endow the medical robot with precision and safety, while ultrasound imaging guidance is specifically evaluated in this study. To evaluate in vivo vascular access in submillimeter vessels, we conducted ultrasound-guided robotic blood drawing on the tail veins (with a diameter of 0.7 plus or minus 0.2 mm) of 40 rats. The results demonstrate that the system achieved a first-attempt success rate of 95 percent. The high first-attempt success rate in intravenous vascular access, even with small blood vessels, demonstrates the system's effectiveness in performing these procedures.

| **[Robot Localization Using a Learned Keypoint Detector and Descriptor with a Floor Camera and a Feature Rich Industrial Floor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03249v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The localization of moving robots depends on the availability of good features from the environment. Sensor systems like Lidar are popular, but unique features can also be extracted from images of the ground. This work presents the Keypoint Localization Framework (KOALA), which utilizes deep neural networks that extract sufficient features from an industrial floor for accurate localization without having readable markers. For this purpose, we use a floor covering that can be produced as cheaply as common industrial floors. Although we do not use any filtering, prior, or temporal information, we can estimate our position in 75.7 % of all images with a mean position error of 2 cm and a rotation error of 2.4 %. Thus, the robot kidnapping problem can be solved with high precision in every frame, even while the robot is moving. Furthermore, we show that our framework with our detector and descriptor combination is able to outperform comparable approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) systems relying on gestures or verbal commands are impractical for the elderly due to difficulties with complex syntax or sign language. To address the challenge, this paper introduces a multi-modal interaction framework that combines voice and deictic posture information to create a more natural HRI system. The visual cues are first processed by the object detection model to gain a global understanding of the environment, and then bounding boxes are estimated based on depth information. By using a large language model (LLM) with voice-to-text commands and temporally aligned selected bounding boxes, robot action sequences can be generated, while key control syntax constraints are applied to avoid potential LLM hallucination issues. The system is evaluated on real-world tasks with varying levels of complexity using a Universal Robots UR3e manipulator. Our method demonstrates significantly better performance in HRI in terms of accuracy and robustness. To benefit the research community and the general public, we will make our code and design open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine</p></details> |

An Empirical Evaluation for Vision-Language Understanding in Robotic-Assisted Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23130v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The DeepSeek models have shown exceptional performance in general scene understanding, question-answering (QA), and text generation tasks, owing to their efficient training paradigm and strong reasoning capabilities. In this study, we investigate the dialogue capabilities of the DeepSeek model in robotic surgery scenarios, focusing on tasks such as Single Phrase QA, Visual QA, and Detailed Description. The Single Phrase QA tasks further include sub-tasks such as surgical instrument recognition, action understanding, and spatial position analysis. We conduct extensive evaluations using publicly available datasets, including EndoVis18 and CholecT50, along with their corresponding dialogue data. Our empirical study shows that, compared to existing general-purpose multimodal large language models, DeepSeek-VL2 performs better on complex understanding tasks in surgical scenes. Additionally, although DeepSeek-V3 is purely a language model, we find that when image tokens are directly inputted, the model demonstrates better performance on single-sentence QA tasks. However, overall, the DeepSeek models still fall short of meeting the clinical requirements for understanding surgical scenes. Under general prompts, DeepSeek models lack the ability to effectively analyze global surgical concepts and fail to provide detailed insights into surgical scenarios. Based on our observations, we argue that the DeepSeek models are not ready for vision-language tasks in surgical contexts without fine-tuning on surgery-specific datasets.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Distributed Resilience-Aware Control in Multi-Robot Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03120v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring resilient consensus in multi-robot systems with misbehaving agents remains a challenge, as many existing network resilience properties are inherently combinatorial and globally defined. While previous works have proposed control laws to enhance or preserve resilience in multi-robot networks, they often assume a fixed topology with known resilience properties, or require global state knowledge. These assumptions may be impractical in physically-constrained environments, where safety and resilience requirements are conflicting, or when misbehaving agents corrupt the shared information. In this work, we propose a distributed control law that enables each robot to guarantee resilient consensus and safety during its navigation without fixed topologies using only locally available information. To this end, we establish a new sufficient condition for resilient consensus in time-varying networks based on the degree of non-misbehaving or normal agents. Using this condition, we design a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based controller that guarantees resilient consensus and collision avoidance without requiring estimates of global state and/or control actions of all other robots. Finally, we validate our method through simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) 2025</p></details> |

However, most prior LLM-based work in robotic applications either directly predicts waypoints or applies LLMs within fixed tool integration frameworks, offering limited flexibility in exploring and configuring solutions best suited to different tasks. In this work, we propose a framework that leverages LLMs to select appropriate planning and control strategies based on task descriptions, environmental constraints, and system dynamics. These strategies are then executed by calling the available comprehensive planning and control APIs. Our approach employs iterative LLM-based reasoning with performance feedback to refine the algorithm selection. We validate our approach through extensive experiments across tasks of varying complexity, from simple tracking to complex planning scenarios involving spatiotemporal constraints. The results demonstrate that using LLMs to determine planning and control strategies from natural language descriptions significantly enhances robotic autonomy while reducing the need for extensive manual tuning and expert knowledge. Furthermore, our framework maintains generalizability across different tasks and notably outperforms baseline methods that rely on LLMs for direct trajectory, control sequence, or code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 14 figures, submitted for CDC 2025 invited session on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Control</p></details> |

Social robots may offer a promising avenue for emotional support, especially when considering the ongoing advancements in conversational AI. This study investigates how repeated interactions with a social robot influence feelings of loneliness and perceived stress, and how such feelings are reflected in the themes of user disclosures towards the robot. Participants engaged in a five-session robot-led intervention, where a large language model powered QTrobot facilitated structured conversations designed to support cognitive reappraisal. Results from linear mixed-effects models show significant reductions in both loneliness and perceived stress over time. Additionally, semantic clustering of 560 user disclosures towards the robot revealed six distinct conversational themes. Results from a Kruskal-Wallis H-test demonstrate that participants reporting higher loneliness and stress more frequently engaged in socially focused disclosures, such as friendship and connection, whereas lower distress was associated with introspective and goal-oriented themes (e.g., academic ambitions). By exploring both how the intervention affects well-being, as well as how well-being shapes the content of robot-directed conversations, we aim to capture the dynamic nature of emotional support in huma-robot interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Laws in Scientific Discovery with AI and Robot Scientists](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22444v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific discovery is poised for rapid advancement through advanced robotics and artificial intelligence. Current scientific practices face substantial limitations as manual experimentation remains time-consuming and resource-intensive, while multidisciplinary research demands knowledge integration beyond individual researchers' expertise boundaries. Here, we envision an autonomous generalist scientist (AGS) concept combines agentic AI and embodied robotics to automate the entire research lifecycle. This system could dynamically interact with both physical and virtual environments while facilitating the integration of knowledge across diverse scientific disciplines. By deploying these technologies throughout every research stage -- spanning literature review, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript writing -- and incorporating internal reflection alongside external feedback, this system aims to significantly reduce the time and resources needed for scientific discovery. Building on the evolution from virtual AI scientists to versatile generalist AI-based robot scientists, AGS promises groundbreaking potential. As these autonomous systems become increasingly integrated into the research process, we hypothesize that scientific discovery might adhere to new scaling laws, potentially shaped by the number and capabilities of these autonomous systems, offering novel perspectives on how knowledge is generated and evolves. The adaptability of embodied robots to extreme environments, paired with the flywheel effect of accumulating scientific knowledge, holds the promise of continually pushing beyond both physical and intellectual frontiers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified World Models: Coupling Video and Action Diffusion for Pretraining on Large Robotic Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02792v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building generalist robots. However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation required for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

| **[GRACE: Generating Socially Appropriate Robot Actions Leveraging LLMs and Human Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16879v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When operating in human environments, robots need to handle complex tasks while both adhering to social norms and accommodating individual preferences. For instance, based on common sense knowledge, a household robot can predict that it should avoid vacuuming during a social gathering, but it may still be uncertain whether it should vacuum before or after having guests. In such cases, integrating common-sense knowledge with human preferences, often conveyed through human explanations, is fundamental yet a challenge for existing systems. In this paper, we introduce GRACE, a novel approach addressing this while generating socially appropriate robot actions. GRACE leverages common sense knowledge from LLMs, and it integrates this knowledge with human explanations through a generative network. The bidirectional structure of GRACE enables robots to refine and enhance LLM predictions by utilizing human explanations and makes robots capable of generating such explanations for human-specified actions. Our evaluations show that integrating human explanations boosts GRACE's performance, where it outperforms several baselines and provides sensible explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA), Supplementary video: https://youtu.be/GTNCC1GkiQ4</p></details> |
| **[Robot-Led Vision Language Model Wellbeing Assessment of Children](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02765v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a novel robot-led approach to assessing children's mental wellbeing using a Vision Language Model (VLM). Inspired by the Child Apperception Test (CAT), the social robot NAO presented children with pictorial stimuli to elicit their verbal narratives of the images, which were then evaluated by a VLM in accordance with CAT assessment guidelines. The VLM's assessments were systematically compared to those provided by a trained psychologist. The results reveal that while the VLM demonstrates moderate reliability in identifying cases with no wellbeing concerns, its ability to accurately classify assessments with clinical concern remains limited. Moreover, although the model's performance was generally consistent when prompted with varying demographic factors such as age and gender, a significantly higher false positive rate was observed for girls, indicating potential sensitivity to gender attribute. These findings highlight both the promise and the challenges of integrating VLMs into robot-led assessments of children's wellbeing.</p></details> |  |

The architecture and connectivity of the MI-HGNN are constructed from the robot morphology, in which nodes and edges are robot joints and links, respectively. By incorporating the morphology-informed constraints into a neural network, we improve a learning-based approach using model-based knowledge. We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness, generalization ability, model efficiency, and sample efficiency. Our MI-HGNN improved the performance of a state-of-the-art model that leverages robot morphological symmetry by 8.4% with only 0.21% of its parameters. Although MI-HGNN is applied to contact perception problems for legged robots in this work, it can be seamlessly applied to other types of multi-body dynamical systems and has the potential to improve other robot learning frameworks.

| **[Autonomous Human-Robot Interaction via Operator Imitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02724v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teleoperated robotic characters can perform expressive interactions with humans, relying on the operators' experience and social intuition. In this work, we propose to create autonomous interactive robots, by training a model to imitate operator data. Our model is trained on a dataset of human-robot interactions, where an expert operator is asked to vary the interactions and mood of the robot, while the operator commands as well as the pose of the human and robot are recorded. Our approach learns to predict continuous operator commands through a diffusion process and discrete commands through a classifier, all unified within a single transformer architecture. We evaluate the resulting model in simulation and with a user study on the real system. We show that our method enables simple autonomous human-robot interactions that are comparable to the expert-operator baseline, and that users can recognize the different robot moods as generated by our model. Finally, we demonstrate a zero-shot transfer of our model onto a different robotic platform with the same operator interface.</p></details> |  |
| **[Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System and Edge Computing Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02492v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a complex environment, for a mobile robot to safely and collision - free avoid all obstacles, it poses high requirements for its intelligence level. Given that the information such as the position and geometric characteristics of obstacles is random, the control parameters of the robot, such as velocity and angular velocity, are also prone to random deviations. To address this issue in the framework of the Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System, this paper proposes a global path control scheme for mobile robots based on deep learning. First of all, the dynamic equation of the mobile robot is established. According to the linear velocity and angular velocity of the mobile robot, its motion behaviors are divided into obstacle - avoidance behavior, target - turning behavior, and target approaching behavior. Subsequently, the neural network method in deep learning is used to build a global path planning model for the robot. On this basis, a fuzzy controller is designed with the help of a fuzzy control algorithm to correct the deviations that occur during path planning, thereby achieving optimized control of the robot's global path. In addition, considering edge computing optimization, the proposed model can process local data at the edge device, reducing the communication burden between the robot and the central server, and improving the real time performance of path planning. The experimental results show that for the mobile robot controlled by the research method in this paper, the deviation distance of the path angle is within 5 cm, the deviation convergence can be completed within 10 ms, and the planned path is shorter. This indicates that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the global path planning ability of mobile robots in the industrial Internet environment and promote the collaborative operation of robots through edge computing optimization.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present an approach for scene flow estimation from low-density and noisy point clouds acquired from miniaturized Time of Flight (ToF) sensors distributed on the robot body. The proposed method clusters points from consecutive frames and applies Iterative Closest Point (ICP) to estimate a dense motion flow, with additional steps introduced to mitigate the impact of sensor noise and low-density data points. Specifically, we employ a fitness-based classification to distinguish between stationary and moving points and an inlier removal strategy to refine geometric correspondences. The proposed approach is validated in an experimental setup where 24 ToF are used to estimate the velocity of an object moving at different controlled speeds. Experimental results show that the method consistently approximates the direction of the motion and its magnitude with an error which is in line with sensor noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

Our primary contributions include the development of an adaptive, ROS-based HRI framework with an open-source code base. This framework supports natural interactions through advanced speech recognition and voice activity detection, and leverages a large language model (LLM) as a dialogue bridge.

Traditional methods primarily optimize geometric fidelity or rendering accuracy, but often overlook operator-specific objectives, such as safety-critical coverage or task-driven viewpoints. This limitation leads to suboptimal viewpoint selection, particularly in constrained environments such as nuclear decommissioning. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework that integrates expert operator preferences into the active 3D scene representation pipeline. Specifically, we employ Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to guide robotic path planning, reshaping the reward function based on expert input. To capture operator-specific priorities, we conduct interactive choice experiments that evaluate user preferences in 3D scene representation. We validate our framework using a UR3e robotic arm for reactor tile inspection in a nuclear decommissioning scenario. Compared to baseline methods, our approach enhances scene representation while optimizing trajectory efficiency. The RLHF-based policy consistently outperforms random selection, prioritizing task-critical details. By unifying explicit 3D geometric modeling with implicit human-in-the-loop optimization, this work establishes a foundation for adaptive, safety-critical robotic perception systems, paving the way for enhanced automation in nuclear decommissioning, remote maintenance, and other high-risk environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

Previous work on topic management in conversational agents has predominantly focused on human engagement and topic personalization, with the agent having an active role in the discussion. Also, studies have shown the usefulness of including robots in groups, yet further exploration is still needed for robots to learn when to change the topic while facilitating discussions. Accordingly, our work investigates the suitability of machine-learning models and audiovisual non-verbal features in predicting appropriate topic changes. We utilized interactions between a robot moderator and human participants, which we annotated and used for extracting acoustic and body language-related features. We provide a detailed analysis of the performance of machine learning approaches using sequential and non-sequential data with different sets of features. The results indicate promising performance in classifying inappropriate topic changes, outperforming rule-based approaches. Additionally, acoustic features exhibited comparable performance and robustness compared to the complete set of multimodal features.

Evaluations are critical to assess progress and build better policies, but evaluation in the real world, especially at a scale that would provide statistically reliable results, is costly in terms of human time and hard to obtain. Evaluation of increasingly generalist robot policies requires an increasingly diverse repertoire of evaluation environments, making the evaluation bottleneck even more pronounced. To make real-world evaluation of robotic policies more practical, we propose AutoEval, a system to autonomously evaluate generalist robot policies around the clock with minimal human intervention. Users interact with AutoEval by submitting evaluation jobs to the AutoEval queue, much like how software jobs are submitted with a cluster scheduling system, and AutoEval will schedule the policies for evaluation within a framework supplying automatic success detection and automatic scene resets. We show that AutoEval can nearly fully eliminate human involvement in the evaluation process, permitting around the clock evaluations, and the evaluation results correspond closely to ground truth evaluations conducted by hand. To facilitate the evaluation of generalist policies in the robotics community, we provide public access to multiple AutoEval scenes in the popular BridgeData robot setup with WidowX robot arms. In the future, we hope that AutoEval scenes can be set up across institutions to form a diverse and distributed evaluation network.</p></details> |  |

However, existing open-source VLMs predominantly trained for generic vision-language alignment tasks fail to model temporally correlated action semantics that are crucial for robotic manipulation effectively. While current image-based fine-tuning methods partially adapt VLMs to robotic applications, they fundamentally disregard temporal evolution patterns in video sequences and suffer from visual feature entanglement between robotic agents, manipulated objects, and environmental contexts, thereby limiting semantic decoupling capability for atomic actions and compromising model generalizability.To overcome these challenges, this work presents RoboAct-CLIP with dual technical contributions: 1) A dataset reconstruction framework that performs semantic-constrained action unit segmentation and re-annotation on open-source robotic videos, constructing purified training sets containing singular atomic actions (e.g., "grasp"); 2) A temporal-decoupling fine-tuning strategy based on Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) architecture, which disentangles temporal action features across video frames from object-centric characteristics to achieve hierarchical representation learning of robotic atomic actions.Experimental results in simulated environments demonstrate that the RoboAct-CLIP pretrained model achieves a 12% higher success rate than baseline VLMs, along with superior generalization in multi-object manipulation tasks.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |

Extending the robot skillset to novel tasks involves gathering an extensive amount of training data for additional tasks. In this paper, we address the problem of teaching new tasks to robots using human demonstration videos for repetitive tasks (e.g., packing). This task requires understanding the human video to identify which object is being manipulated (the pick object) and where it is being placed (the placement slot). In addition, it needs to re-identify the pick object and the placement slots during inference along with the relative poses to enable robot execution of the task. To tackle this, we propose SLeRP, a modular system that leverages several advanced visual foundation models and a novel slot-level placement detector Slot-Net, eliminating the need for expensive video demonstrations for training. We evaluate our system using a new benchmark of real-world videos. The evaluation results show that SLeRP outperforms several baselines and can be deployed on a real robot.</p></details> |  |

Simulation has great potential in supplementing large-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and automated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior datasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it to the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality gap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of simulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown this strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one trained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community lacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes to reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work presents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve vision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from comprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various simulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a humanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance real-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences between the simulation and real-world data.

Examples include multi-robot task allocation, vehicle routing, target protection, and surveillance. While the theoretical analysis of distributed optimization algorithms has received significant attention, its application to cooperative robotics has not been investigated in detail. In this paper, we show how notable scenarios in cooperative robotics can be addressed by suitable distributed optimization setups. Specifically, after a brief introduction on the widely investigated consensus optimization (most suited for data analytics) and on the partition-based setup (matching the graph structure in the optimization), we focus on two distributed settings modeling several scenarios in cooperative robotics, i.e., the so-called constraint-coupled and aggregative optimization frameworks. For each one, we consider use-case applications, and we discuss tailored distributed algorithms with their convergence properties. Then, we revise state-of-the-art toolboxes allowing for the implementation of distributed schemes on real networks of robots without central coordinators. For each use case, we discuss its implementation in these toolboxes and provide simulations and real experiments on networks of heterogeneous robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOLAQUA: SINTEF Ocean Large Aquaculture Robotics Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01790v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a dataset gathered with an underwater robot in a sea-based aquaculture setting. Data was gathered from an operational fish farm and includes data from sensors such as the Waterlinked A50 DVL, the Nortek Nucleus 1000 DVL, Sonardyne Micro Ranger 2 USBL, Sonoptix Mulitbeam Sonar, mono and stereo cameras, and vehicle sensor data such as power usage, IMU, pressure, temperature, and more. Data acquisition is performed during both manual and autonomous traversal of the net pen structure. The collected vision data is of undamaged nets with some fish and marine growth presence, and it is expected that both the research community and the aquaculture industry will benefit greatly from the utilization of the proposed SOLAQUA dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prior Lessons of Incremental Dialogue and Robot Action Management for the Age of Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00953v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efforts towards endowing robots with the ability to speak have benefited from recent advancements in natural language processing, in particular large language models. However, current language models are not fully incremental, as their processing is inherently monotonic and thus lack the ability to revise their interpretations or output in light of newer observations. This monotonicity has important implications for the development of dialogue systems for human--robot interaction. In this paper, we review the literature on interactive systems that operate incrementally (i.e., at the word level or below it). We motivate the need for incremental systems, survey incremental modeling of important aspects of dialogue like speech recognition and language generation. Primary focus is on the part of the system that makes decisions, known as the dialogue manager. We find that there is very little research on incremental dialogue management, offer some requirements for practical incremental dialogue management, and the implications of incremental dialogue for embodied, robotic platforms in the age of large language models.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[A Model-Agnostic Approach for Semantically Driven Disambiguation in Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17004v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambiguities are inevitable in human-robot interaction, especially when a robot follows user instructions in a large, shared space. For example, if a user asks the robot to find an object in a home environment with underspecified instructions, the object could be in multiple locations depending on missing factors. For instance, a bowl might be in the kitchen cabinet or on the dining room table, depending on whether it is clean or dirty, full or empty, and the presence of other objects around it. Previous works on object search have assumed that the queried object is immediately visible to the robot or have predicted object locations using one-shot inferences, which are likely to fail for ambiguous or partially understood instructions. This paper focuses on these gaps and presents a novel model-agnostic approach leveraging semantically driven clarifications to enhance the robot's ability to locate queried objects in fewer attempts. Specifically, we leverage different knowledge embedding models, and when ambiguities arise, we propose an informative clarification method, which follows an iterative prediction process. The user experiment evaluation of our method shows that our approach is applicable to different custom semantic encoders as well as LLMs, and informative clarifications improve performances, enabling the robot to locate objects on its first attempts. The user experiment data is publicly available at https://github.com/IrmakDogan/ExpressionDataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robot & Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN), Supplementary video: https://youtu.be/_P0v07Xc24Y, Dataset publicly available: https://github.com/IrmakDogan/ExpressionDataset</p></details> |
| **[TransforMerger: Transformer-based Voice-Gesture Fusion for Robust Human-Robot Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01708v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As human-robot collaboration advances, natural and flexible communication methods are essential for effective robot control. Traditional methods relying on a single modality or rigid rules struggle with noisy or misaligned data as well as with object descriptions that do not perfectly fit the predefined object names (e.g. 'Pick that red object'). We introduce TransforMerger, a transformer-based reasoning model that infers a structured action command for robotic manipulation based on fused voice and gesture inputs. Our approach merges multimodal data into a single unified sentence, which is then processed by the language model. We employ probabilistic embeddings to handle uncertainty and we integrate contextual scene understanding to resolve ambiguous references (e.g., gestures pointing to multiple objects or vague verbal cues like "this"). We evaluate TransforMerger in simulated and real-world experiments, demonstrating its robustness to noise, misalignment, and missing information. Our results show that TransforMerger outperforms deterministic baselines, especially in scenarios requiring more contextual knowledge, enabling more robust and flexible human-robot communication. Code and datasets are available at: http://imitrob.ciirc.cvut.cz/publications/transformerger.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Anticipating Degradation: A Predictive Approach to Fault Tolerance in Robot Swarms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01594v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An active approach to fault tolerance is essential for robot swarms to achieve long-term autonomy. Previous efforts have focused on responding to spontaneous electro-mechanical faults and failures. However, many faults occur gradually over time. Waiting until such faults have manifested as failures before addressing them is both inefficient and unsustainable in a variety of scenarios. This work argues that the principles of predictive maintenance, in which potential faults are resolved before they hinder the operation of the swarm, offer a promising means of achieving long-term fault tolerance. This is a novel approach to swarm fault tolerance, which is shown to give a comparable or improved performance when tested against a reactive approach in almost all cases tested.</p></details> |  |
