| **[HO-Cap: A Capture System and Dataset for 3D Reconstruction and Pose Tracking of Hand-Object Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06843v4)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a data capture system and a new dataset, HO-Cap, for 3D reconstruction and pose tracking of hands and objects in videos. The system leverages multiple RGBD cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning in visual navigation of end-to-end trained agents: a dynamical systems approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08306v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Progress in Embodied AI has made it possible for end-to-end-trained agents to navigate in photo-realistic environments with high-level reasoning and zero-shot or language-conditioned behavior, but benchmarks are still dominated by simulation. In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control. An interactive tool is available at europe.naverlabs.com/research/publications/reasoning-in-visual-navigation-of-end-to-end-trained-agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Effectiveness of a Socratic Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning Method for Task Planning in Robotics, A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08174v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in reasoning with natural language. Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks. To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenFly: A Versatile Toolchain and Large-scale Benchmark for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents through an environment by leveraging both language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Dynamic Hand-Object Interactions with Applications to Human-Robot Handovers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04879v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans frequently grasp, manipulate, and move objects. Interactive systems assist humans in these tasks, enabling applications in Embodied AI, human-robot interaction, and virtual reality. However, current methods in hand-object synthesis often neglect dynamics and focus on generating static grasps. The first part of this dissertation introduces dynamic grasp synthesis, where a hand grasps and moves an object to a target pose. We approach this task using physical simulation and reinforcement learning. We then extend this to bimanual manipulation and articulated objects, requiring fine-grained coordination between hands. In the second part of this dissertation, we study human-to-robot handovers. We integrate captured human motion into simulation and introduce a student-teacher framework that adapts to human behavior and transfers from sim to real. To overcome data scarcity, we generate synthetic interactions, increasing training diversity by 100x. Our user study finds no difference between policies trained on synthetic vs. real motions.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |
| **[SonicSim: A customizable simulation platform for speech processing in moving sound source scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01481v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systematic evaluation of speech separation and enhancement models under moving sound source conditions requires extensive and diverse data. However, real-world datasets often lack sufficient data for training and evaluation, and synthetic datasets, while larger, lack acoustic realism. Consequently, neither effectively meets practical needs. To address this issue, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit based on the embodied AI simulation platform Habitat-sim, designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim supports multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level adjustments, enabling the creation of more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a benchmark dataset called SonicSet, utilizing LibriSpeech, Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K), Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to investigate the differences between synthetic and real-world data, we selected 5 hours of raw, non-reverberant data from the SonicSet validation set and recorded a real-world speech separation dataset, providing a reference for comparing SonicSet with other synthetic datasets. For speech enhancement, we utilized the real-world dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between SonicSet and existing synthetic datasets. The results indicate that models trained on SonicSet generalize better to real-world scenarios compared to other synthetic datasets. The code is publicly available at https://cslikai.cn/SonicSim/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14093v4)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI is widely recognized as a key element of artificial general intelligence because it involves controlling embodied agents to perform tasks in the physical world. Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |
| **[WMNav: Integrating Vision-Language Models into World Models for Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02247v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Goal Navigation-requiring an agent to locate a specific object in an unseen environment-remains a core challenge in embodied AI. Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

| **[From Screens to Scenes: A Survey of Embodied AI in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07468v3)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare systems worldwide face persistent challenges in efficiency, accessibility, and personalization. Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 11 figures, manuscript accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |
| **[AffordGrasp: In-Context Affordance Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary Task-Oriented Grasping in Clutter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00778v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring the affordance of an object and grasping it in a task-oriented manner is crucial for robots to successfully complete manipulation tasks. Affordance indicates where and how to grasp an object by taking its functionality into account, serving as the foundation for effective task-oriented grasping. However, current task-oriented methods often depend on extensive training data that is confined to specific tasks and objects, making it difficult to generalize to novel objects and complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce AffordGrasp, a novel open-vocabulary grasping framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) for in-context affordance reasoning. Unlike existing methods that rely on explicit task and object specifications, our approach infers tasks directly from implicit user instructions, enabling more intuitive and seamless human-robot interaction in everyday scenarios. Building on the reasoning outcomes, our framework identifies task-relevant objects and grounds their part-level affordances using a visual grounding module. This allows us to generate task-oriented grasp poses precisely within the affordance regions of the object, ensuring both functional and context-aware robotic manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. We believe our approach advances robotic manipulation techniques and contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://eqcy.github.io/affordgrasp/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPA: 3D Spatial-Awareness Enables Effective Embodied Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08208v3)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce SPA, a novel representation learning framework that emphasizes the importance of 3D spatial awareness in embodied AI. Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

| **[3D-Mem: 3D Scene Memory for Embodied Exploration and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17735v4)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing compact and informative 3D scene representations is essential for effective embodied exploration and reasoning, especially in complex environments over extended periods. Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[ManiSkill-HAB: A Benchmark for Low-Level Manipulation in Home Rearrangement Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13211v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality benchmarks are the foundation for embodied AI research, enabling significant advancements in long-horizon navigation, manipulation and rearrangement tasks. However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of prior magical grasp implementations at a fraction of the GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping Language-Guided Navigation Learning with Self-Refining Data Flywheel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08467v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating high-quality data for training robust language-instructed agents is a long-lasting challenge in embodied AI. In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |
| **[Towards Robust and Secure Embodied AI: A Survey on Vulnerabilities and Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13175v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, including robots and autonomous vehicles, are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, where they encounter a range of vulnerabilities stemming from both environmental and system-level factors. These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConsistentDreamer: View-Consistent Meshes Through Balanced Multi-View Gaussian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09278v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved 3D generation, enabling the use of assets generated from an image for embodied AI simulations. However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Pattern Recognition Letters.

| **[MapNav: A Novel Memory Representation via Annotated Semantic Maps for VLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13451v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a key task in Embodied AI, requiring agents to navigate diverse and unseen environments while following natural language instructions. Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defining and Evaluating Visual Language Models' Basic Spatial Abilities: A Perspective from Psychometrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11859v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Theory of Multiple Intelligences underscores the hierarchical nature of cognitive capabilities. To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, when powered by open LLMs, they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a multicomponent memory system. In Minecraft experiments, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks where traditional Voyager fails without GPT-4, collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items and achieving $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones, advancing from basic wood tools to advanced iron equipment. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated collaborative experiences. MindForge advances the democratization of embodied AI development through open-ended social learning, enabling peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sce2DriveX: A Generalized MLLM Framework for Scene-to-Drive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14917v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving, which directly maps raw sensor inputs to low-level vehicle controls, is an important part of Embodied AI. Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoFar: Language-Grounded Orientation Bridges Spatial Reasoning and Object Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13143v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence is a critical component of embodied AI, promoting robots to understand and interact with their environments. While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |

Recent advances in foundation models pave the way for generative agents capable of richer communication and adaptive problem-solving. This survey provides a systematic examination of how EMAS can benefit from these generative capabilities. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes EMAS by system architectures and embodiment modalities, emphasizing how collaboration spans both physical and virtual contexts. Central building blocks, perception, planning, communication, and feedback, are then analyzed to illustrate how generative techniques bolster system robustness and flexibility. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the transformative effects of integrating foundation models into embodied, multi-agent frameworks. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions, underlining the significant promise of EMAS to reshape the landscape of AI-driven collaboration.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Object-Centric Latent Action Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09680v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging vast amounts of internet video data for Embodied AI is currently bottle-necked by the lack of action annotations and the presence of action-correlated distractors. We propose a novel object-centric latent action learning approach, based on VideoSaur and LAPO, that employs self-supervised decomposition of scenes into object representations and annotates video data with proxy-action labels. This method effectively disentangles causal agent-object interactions from irrelevant background noise and reduces the performance degradation of latent action learning approaches caused by distractors. Our preliminary experiments with the Distracting Control Suite show that latent action pretraining based on object decompositions improve the quality of inferred latent actions by x2.7 and efficiency of downstream fine-tuning with a small set of labeled actions, increasing return by x2.6 on average.</p></details> | Preprint.

| **[POEX: Understanding and Mitigating Policy Executable Jailbreak Attacks against Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16633v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems are rapidly evolving due to the integration of LLMs as planning modules, which transform complex instructions into executable policies. However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

These advancements have led to an explosive increase in the demand for computational power, challenging the limits of Moore's Law. Optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing, faces significant challenges due to its high costs. To address this, various lithography simulators have been developed. However, many of these simulators are limited by their inadequate photoresist modeling capabilities. This paper presents TorchResist, an open-source, differentiable photoresist simulator.TorchResist employs an analytical approach to model the photoresist process, functioning as a white-box system with at most twenty interpretable parameters. Leveraging modern differentiable programming techniques and parallel computing on GPUs, TorchResist enables seamless co-optimization with other tools across multiple related tasks.

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |

Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code will be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</p></details> |  |

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | Preprint.

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |

This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions. This highlights the critical need for robust goal specification and safety frameworks before any physical implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected Version - Solved Some Issues with reference compilation by latex</p></details> |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

Nevertheless, the rapid development of MEANETs is accompanied by challenges in trustworthiness and operational efficiency. Fortunately, blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable characteristics, offers promising solutions for MEANETs. However, existing block propagation mechanisms suffer from challenges such as low propagation efficiency and weak security for block propagation, which results in delayed transmission of vehicular messages or vulnerability to malicious tampering, potentially causing severe traffic accidents in blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Moreover, current block propagation strategies cannot effectively adapt to real-time changes of dynamic topology in MEANETs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph Resfusion model-based trustworthy block propagation optimization framework for consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Specifically, we propose an innovative trust calculation mechanism based on the trust cloud model, which comprehensively accounts for randomness and fuzziness in the miner trust evaluation. Furthermore, by leveraging the strengths of graph neural networks and diffusion models, we develop a graph Resfusion model to effectively and adaptively generate the optimal block propagation trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other routing mechanisms in terms of block propagation efficiency and trustworthiness. Additionally, the results highlight its strong adaptability to dynamic environments, making it particularly suitable for rapidly changing MEANETs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</p></details> | Website: GenEx.world |

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences.

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |

The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV. Finally, we discuss several future research directions for advancing EAI-enabled LAE.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</p></details> |  |

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/</p></details> |

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |

However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This study finds that state-of-the-art embodied AI agents compete for higher navigation quality, but often compromise the computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce "Skip-SCAR," an optimization framework that builds computationally and memory-efficient embodied AI agents to accomplish high-quality visual navigation tasks. Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint. Tested on the HM3D ObjectNav datasets and real-world physical hardware systems, Skip-SCAR not only minimizes hardware resources but also sets new performance benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of optimizing both navigation quality and computational efficiency for robotics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |

Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

Despite recent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods often lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in scenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this paper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and scalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors and multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion (OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved surfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric fidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital twins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM-based planners are inefficient due to their large number of parameters and prone to inaccuracies because they operate in open-loop systems. We think the reason is that only applying LLMs as planners is insufficient. In this work, we propose DaDu-E, a robust closed-loop planning framework for embodied AI robots. Specifically, DaDu-E is equipped with a relatively lightweight LLM, a set of encapsulated robot skill instructions, a robust feedback system, and memory augmentation. Together, these components enable DaDu-E to (i) actively perceive and adapt to dynamic environments, (ii) optimize computational costs while maintaining high performance, and (iii) recover from execution failures using its memory and feedback mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world and simulated tasks show that DaDu-E achieves task success rates comparable to embodied AI robots with larger models as planners like COME-Robot, while reducing computational requirements by $6.6 \times$.

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand.

| **[Learning Reward and Policy Jointly from Demonstration and Preference Improves Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06874v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for building contemporary foundation models and embodied AI. However, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning task. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant under-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward model and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment performance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated Human Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and demonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach admits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and leverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy Optimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment pipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with extensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially when the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[EARBench: Towards Evaluating Physical Risk Awareness for Task Planning of Foundation Model-based Embodied AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04449v5)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) integrates advanced AI models into physical entities for real-world interaction. The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EARBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EARDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downstream tasks. Image-to-video diffusion models are already capable of generating highly realistic synthetic videos. However, these models are not action-conditioned, and the most powerful models are closed-source which means they cannot be finetuned. In this work, we propose to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to action-conditioned world models, without access to the parameters of the pretrained model. Our approach, AVID, trains an adapter on a small domain-specific dataset of action-labelled videos. AVID uses a learned mask to modify the intermediate outputs of the pretrained model and generate accurate action-conditioned videos. We evaluate AVID on video game and real-world robotics data, and show that it outperforms existing baselines for diffusion model adaptation.1 Our results demonstrate that if utilized correctly, pretrained video models have the potential to be powerful tools for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/avid-world-model-adapters/home</p></details> |

In this study, we introduce ROOT, a VLM-based system designed to enhance the analysis of indoor scenes. Specifically, we first develop an iterative object perception algorithm using GPT-4V to detect object entities within indoor scenes. This is followed by employing vision foundation models to acquire additional meta-information about the scene, such as bounding boxes. Building on this foundational data, we propose a specialized VLM, SceneVLM, which is capable of generating spatial hierarchical scene graphs and providing distance information for objects within indoor environments. This information enhances our understanding of the spatial arrangement of indoor scenes. To train our SceneVLM, we collect over 610,000 images from various public indoor datasets and implement a scene data generation pipeline with a semi-automated technique to establish relationships and estimate distances among indoor objects. By utilizing this enriched data, we conduct various training recipes and finish SceneVLM. Our experiments demonstrate that \rootname facilitates indoor scene understanding and proves effective in diverse downstream applications, such as 3D scene generation and embodied AI. The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/harrytea/ROOT}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs and 3D segmentation masks. In addition, we design MORE3D, a simple yet effective method that enables multi-object 3D reasoning segmentation with user questions and textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative World Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

| **[Software-Hardware Co-Design For Embodied AI Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04292v4)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI robots have the potential to fundamentally improve the way human beings live and manufacture. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame-basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes Corki, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI robot control. Our idea is to decouple LLM inference, robotic control and data communication in the embodied AI robots compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, Corki predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. Corki largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to 8.0x, resulting in up to 3.6x speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 17.3%. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/hyy0613/Corki</p></details> |  |

Generated models frequently fail to maintain balance when placed in physics-based simulations or 3D printed. This balance is crucial for satisfying user design intentions in interactive gaming, embodied AI, and robotics, where stable models are needed for reliable interaction. Additionally, stable models ensure that 3D-printed objects, such as figurines for home decoration, can stand on their own without requiring additional supports. To fill this gap, we introduce Atlas3D, an automatic and easy-to-implement method that enhances existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D tools. Atlas3D ensures the generation of self-supporting 3D models that adhere to physical laws of stability under gravity, contact, and friction. Our approach combines a novel differentiable simulation-based loss function with physically inspired regularization, serving as either a refinement or a post-processing module for existing frameworks. We verify Atlas3D's efficacy through extensive generation tasks and validate the resulting 3D models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunuoch.github.io/Atlas3D/</p></details> |

Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing Architect, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene. This iterative structure brings the flexibility for our method to generate or refine scenes from various starting points, such as text, floor plans, or pre-arranged environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Models in Vision: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05902v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive modeling has been a huge success in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, \textit{i.e.}, pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the strategy of representation. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multi-faceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multi-modal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: \url{https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey}.</p></details> |  |

Scene Retrieval with Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14565v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interfaces to embodied AI are becoming more ubiquitous in our daily lives. This opens up further opportunities for language-based interaction with embodied agents, such as a user verbally instructing an agent to execute some task in a specific location. For example, "put the bowls back in the cupboard next to the fridge" or "meet me at the intersection under the red sign." As such, we need methods that interface between natural language and map representations of the environment. To this end, we explore the question of whether we can use an open-set natural language query to identify a scene represented by a 3D scene graph. We define this task as "language-based scene-retrieval" and it is closely related to "coarse-localization," but we are instead searching for a match from a collection of disjoint scenes and not necessarily a large-scale continuous map. We present Text2SceneGraphMatcher, a "scene-retrieval" pipeline that learns joint embeddings between text descriptions and scene graphs to determine if they are a match. The code, trained models, and datasets will be made public.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

However, current VLN frameworks often rely on static environments and optimal expert supervision, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation (HA-VLN), extending traditional VLN by incorporating dynamic human activities and relaxing key assumptions.

To tackle HA-VLN challenges, we present the Expert-Supervised Cross-Modal (VLN-CM) and Non-Expert-Supervised Decision Transformer (VLN-DT) agents, utilizing cross-modal fusion and diverse training strategies for effective navigation in dynamic human environments. A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability.

Our system is modular: it deploys state of the art Large Language Models for task planning,Vision-Language models for semantic perception, and Point Cloud transformers for grasping. With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities. One may also in-place swap modules to improve the robustness of the overall platform, for instance with imitation-learned policies.

At present, many evaluation platforms with rich scenes, high visual fidelity and various application scenarios have been developed. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework named NeuronsGym that can be used for policy learning of robot tasks, covering a simulation platform for training policy, and a physical system for studying sim2real problems. Unlike most current single-task, slow-moving robotic platforms, our framework provides agile physical robots with a wider range of speeds, and can be employed to train robotic navigation and confrontation policies. At the same time, in order to evaluate the safety of robot navigation, we propose a safety-weighted path length (SFPL) to improve the safety evaluation in the current mobile robot navigation. Based on this platform, we build a new benchmark for navigation and confrontation tasks under this platform by comparing the current mainstream sim2real methods, and hold the 2022 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) RoboMaster sim2real challenge. We release the codes of this framework\footnote{\url{https://github.com/DRL-CASIA/NeuronsGym}} and hope that this platform can promote the development of more flexible and agile general mobile agent algorithms.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[EnvBridge: Bridging Diverse Environments with Cross-Environment Knowledge Transfer for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16919v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated high reasoning capabilities, drawing attention for their applications as agents in various decision-making processes. One notably promising application of LLM agents is robotic manipulation. Recent research has shown that LLMs can generate text planning or control code for robots, providing substantial flexibility and interaction capabilities. However, these methods still face challenges in terms of flexibility and applicability across different environments, limiting their ability to adapt autonomously. Current approaches typically fall into two categories: those relying on environment-specific policy training, which restricts their transferability, and those generating code actions based on fixed prompts, which leads to diminished performance when confronted with new environments. These limitations significantly constrain the generalizability of agents in robotic manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called EnvBridge. This approach involves the retention and transfer of successful robot control codes from source environments to target environments. EnvBridge enhances the agent's adaptability and performance across diverse settings by leveraging insights from multiple environments. Notably, our approach alleviates environmental constraints, offering a more flexible and generalizable solution for robotic manipulation tasks. We validated the effectiveness of our method using robotic manipulation benchmarks: RLBench, MetaWorld, and CALVIN. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully leverage diverse knowledge sources to solve complex tasks. Consequently, our approach significantly enhances the adaptability and robustness of robotic manipulation agents in planning across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

When integrated into an embodied agent, existing embodied VLM works either output detailed action sequences at the manipulation level or only provide plans at an abstract level, leaving a gap between high-level planning and real-world manipulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octopus, an embodied vision-language programmer that uses executable code generation as a medium to connect planning and manipulation. Octopus is designed to 1) proficiently comprehend an agent's visual and textual task objectives, 2) formulate intricate action sequences, and 3) generate executable code. To facilitate Octopus model development, we introduce OctoVerse: a suite of environments tailored for benchmarking vision-based code generators on a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games such as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Minecraft. To train Octopus, we leverage GPT-4 to control an explorative agent that generates training data, i.e., action blueprints and corresponding executable code. We also collect feedback that enables an enhanced training scheme called Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate Octopus's functionality and present compelling results, showing that the proposed RLEF refines the agent's decision-making. By open-sourcing our simulation environments, dataset, and model architecture, we aspire to ignite further innovation and foster collaborative applications within the broader embodied AI community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://choiszt.github.io/Octopus/, Codebase: https://github.com/dongyh20/Octopus</p></details> |

More recently, multi-agent systems with LLM-based agents (Multi-LLM) have been utilized increasingly more for QA. In these scenarios, the models may each answer the question and reach a consensus or each model is specialized to answer different domain questions. However, most prior work dealing with Multi-LLM QA has focused on scenarios where the models are asked in a zero-shot manner or are given information sources to extract the answer. For question answering of an unknown environment, embodied exploration of the environment is first needed to answer the question. This skill is necessary for personalizing embodied AI to environments such as households. There is a lack of insight into whether a Multi-LLM system can handle question-answering based on observations from embodied exploration. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the use of Multi-Embodied LLM Explorers (MELE) for QA in an unknown environment. Multiple LLM-based agents independently explore and then answer queries about a household environment. We analyze different aggregation methods to generate a single, final answer for each query: debating, majority voting, and training a central answer module (CAM). Using CAM, we observe a $46\%$ higher accuracy compared against the other non-learning-based aggregation methods. We provide code and the query dataset for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Through this unified latent action space, IGOR enables knowledge transfer among large-scale robot and human activity data. We achieve this by compressing visual changes between an initial image and its goal state into latent actions. IGOR allows us to generate latent action labels for internet-scale video data. This unified latent action space enables the training of foundation policy and world models across a wide variety of tasks performed by both robots and humans. We demonstrate that: (1) IGOR learns a semantically consistent action space for both human and robots, characterizing various possible motions of objects representing the physical interaction knowledge; (2) IGOR can "migrate" the movements of the object in the one video to other videos, even across human and robots, by jointly using the latent action model and world model; (3) IGOR can learn to align latent actions with natural language through the foundation policy model, and integrate latent actions with a low-level policy model to achieve effective robot control. We believe IGOR opens new possibilities for human-to-robot knowledge transfer and control.</p></details> |  |

Majority of prior arts adhere to an open-loop philosophy and lack real-time feedback, leading to error accumulation and undesirable robustness. A handful of approaches have endeavored to establish feedback mechanisms leveraging pixel-level differences or pre-trained visual representations, yet their efficacy and adaptability have been found to be constrained. Inspired by classic closed-loop control systems, we propose CLOVER, a closed-loop visuomotor control framework that incorporates feedback mechanisms to improve adaptive robotic control. CLOVER consists of a text-conditioned video diffusion model for generating visual plans as reference inputs, a measurable embedding space for accurate error quantification, and a feedback-driven controller that refines actions from feedback and initiates replans as needed. Our framework exhibits notable advancement in real-world robotic tasks and achieves state-of-the-art on CALVIN benchmark, improving by 8% over previous open-loop counterparts.

Building on previous work, EgoThink, we introduce VidEgoThink, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating egocentric video understanding capabilities. To bridge the gap between MLLMs and low-level control in Embodied AI, we design four key interrelated tasks: video question-answering, hierarchy planning, visual grounding and reward modeling. To minimize manual annotation costs, we develop an automatic data generation pipeline based on the Ego4D dataset, leveraging the prior knowledge and multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o. Three human annotators then filter the generated data to ensure diversity and quality, resulting in the VidEgoThink benchmark. We conduct extensive experiments with three types of models: API-based MLLMs, open-source image-based MLLMs, and open-source video-based MLLMs. Experimental results indicate that all MLLMs, including GPT-4o, perform poorly across all tasks related to egocentric video understanding. These findings suggest that foundation models still require significant advancements to be effectively applied to first-person scenarios in Embodied AI. In conclusion, VidEgoThink reflects a research trend towards employing MLLMs for egocentric vision, akin to human capabilities, enabling active observation and interaction in the complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[M2Diffuser: Diffusion-based Trajectory Optimization for Mobile Manipulation in 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11402v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have opened new avenues for research into embodied AI agents and robotics. Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation-a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation-remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[EgoChoir: Capturing 3D Human-Object Interaction Regions from Egocentric Views](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13659v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding egocentric human-object interaction (HOI) is a fundamental aspect of human-centric perception, facilitating applications like AR/VR and embodied AI. For the egocentric HOI, in addition to perceiving semantics e.g., ''what'' interaction is occurring, capturing ''where'' the interaction specifically manifests in 3D space is also crucial, which links the perception and operation. Existing methods primarily leverage observations of HOI to capture interaction regions from an exocentric view. However, incomplete observations of interacting parties in the egocentric view introduce ambiguity between visual observations and interaction contents, impairing their efficacy. From the egocentric view, humans integrate the visual cortex, cerebellum, and brain to internalize their intentions and interaction concepts of objects, allowing for the pre-formulation of interactions and making behaviors even when interaction regions are out of sight. In light of this, we propose harmonizing the visual appearance, head motion, and 3D object to excavate the object interaction concept and subject intention, jointly inferring 3D human contact and object affordance from egocentric videos. To achieve this, we present EgoChoir, which links object structures with interaction contexts inherent in appearance and head motion to reveal object affordance, further utilizing it to model human contact. Additionally, a gradient modulation is employed to adopt appropriate clues for capturing interaction regions across various egocentric scenarios. Moreover, 3D contact and affordance are annotated for egocentric videos collected from Ego-Exo4D and GIMO to support the task. Extensive experiments on them demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of EgoChoir.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2024, project: https://yyvhang.github.io/EgoChoir/</p></details> |

Accomplishing this goal requires learning to ground language in perception and embodied actions, in order to accomplish complex tasks. The Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project tackles this by training agents to follow free-form instructions across a diverse range of virtual 3D environments, including curated research environments as well as open-ended, commercial video games. Our goal is to develop an instructable agent that can accomplish anything a human can do in any simulated 3D environment. Our approach focuses on language-driven generality while imposing minimal assumptions. Our agents interact with environments in real-time using a generic, human-like interface: the inputs are image observations and language instructions and the outputs are keyboard-and-mouse actions. This general approach is challenging, but it allows agents to ground language across many visually complex and semantically rich environments while also allowing us to readily run agents in new environments. In this paper we describe our motivation and goal, the initial progress we have made, and promising preliminary results on several diverse research environments and a variety of commercial video games.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Robotics and Embodied AI make public urban spaces no longer exclusive to humans. Food delivery bots and electric wheelchairs have started sharing sidewalks with pedestrians, while robot dogs and humanoids have recently emerged in the street. Micromobility enabled by AI for short-distance travel in public urban spaces plays a crucial component in the future transportation system. Ensuring the generalizability and safety of AI models maneuvering mobile machines is essential. In this work, we present MetaUrban, a compositional simulation platform for the AI-driven urban micromobility research. MetaUrban can construct an infinite number of interactive urban scenes from compositional elements, covering a vast array of ground plans, object placements, pedestrians, vulnerable road users, and other mobile agents' appearances and dynamics. We design point navigation and social navigation tasks as the pilot study using MetaUrban for urban micromobility research and establish various baselines of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. We conduct extensive evaluation across mobile machines, demonstrating that heterogeneous mechanical structures significantly influence the learning and execution of AI policies. We perform a thorough ablation study, showing that the compositional nature of the simulated environments can substantially improve the generalizability and safety of the trained mobile agents.

Hand motion models with the sophistication to accurately recreate piano playing have a wide range of applications in character animation, embodied AI, biomechanics, and VR/AR. In this paper, we construct a first-of-its-kind large-scale dataset that contains approximately 10 hours of 3D hand motion and audio from 15 elite-level pianists playing 153 pieces of classical music. To capture natural performances, we designed a markerless setup in which motions are reconstructed from multi-view videos using state-of-the-art pose estimation models. The motion data is further refined via inverse kinematics using the high-resolution MIDI key-pressing data obtained from sensors in a specialized Yamaha Disklavier piano. Leveraging the collected dataset, we developed a pipeline that can synthesize physically-plausible hand motions for musical scores outside of the dataset. Our approach employs a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning to obtain policies for physics-based bimanual control involving the interaction between hands and piano keys. To solve the sampling efficiency problem with the large motion dataset, we use a diffusion model to generate natural reference motions, which provide high-level trajectory and fingering (finger order and placement) information. However, the generated reference motion alone does not provide sufficient accuracy for piano performance modeling. We then further augmented the data by using musical similarity to retrieve similar motions from the captured dataset to boost the precision of the RL policy. With the proposed method, our model generates natural, dexterous motions that generalize to music from outside the training dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2024.

Referred to as "zero-shot learning", this ability remains elusive for general-purpose reinforcement learning algorithms. While recent works have attempted to produce zero-shot RL agents, they make assumptions about the nature of the tasks or the structure of the MDP. We present Proto Successor Measure: the basis set for all possible behaviors of a Reinforcement Learning Agent in a dynamical system. We prove that any possible behavior (represented using visitation distributions) can be represented using an affine combination of these policy-independent basis functions. Given a reward function at test time, we simply need to find the right set of linear weights to combine these bases corresponding to the optimal policy. We derive a practical algorithm to learn these basis functions using reward-free interaction data from the environment and show that our approach can produce the optimal policy at test time for any given reward function without additional environmental interactions.

In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward~(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) framework enhances flexibility through network slicing and closed-loop RAN control. Central to this evolution is integrating machine learning (ML) for dynamic network control. This paper presents a framework to optimize O-RAN operation. First, we build and share a robust O-RAN dataset from real-world traffic captured across diverse locations and mobility scenarios, replicated within a full-stack srsRAN-based O-RAN system using the Colosseum RF emulator. This dataset supports ML training and deployment. We then introduce a traffic classification approach leveraging various ML models, demonstrating rapid training, testing, and refinement to improve accuracy. With up to 99% offline accuracy and 92% online accuracy for specific slices, our framework adapts efficiently to different models and network conditions. Finally, we present a physical resource block (PRB) assignment optimization strategy using reinforcement learning to refine resource allocation. Our learned policy achieves a mean performance score (0.631), surpassing a manually configured expert policy (0.609) and a random baseline (0.588), demonstrating improved PRB utilization. More importantly, our approach exhibits lower variability, with the Coefficient of Variation (CV) reduced by up to an order of magnitude in three out of four cases, ensuring more consistent performance.

Yet, its efficacy in training vision-language model (VLM) agents for goal-directed action reasoning in visual environments is less established. This work investigates this problem through extensive experiments on complex card games, such as 24 points, and embodied tasks from ALFWorld. We find that when rewards are based solely on action outcomes, RL fails to incentivize CoT reasoning in VLMs, instead leading to a phenomenon we termed thought collapse, characterized by a rapid loss of diversity in the agent's thoughts, state-irrelevant and incomplete reasoning, and subsequent invalid actions, resulting in negative rewards. To counteract thought collapse, we highlight the necessity of process guidance and propose an automated corrector that evaluates and refines the agent's reasoning at each RL step. This simple and scalable GTR (Guided Thought Reinforcement) framework trains reasoning and action simultaneously without the need for dense, per-step human labeling. Our experiments demonstrate that GTR significantly enhances the performance and generalization of the LLaVA-7b model across various visual environments, achieving 3-5 times higher task success rates compared to SoTA models with notably smaller model sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[PCA-Featured Transformer for Jamming Detection in 5G UAV Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15312v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) face significant security risks from jamming attacks, which can compromise network functionality. Traditional detection methods often fall short when confronting AI-powered jamming that dynamically modifies its behavior, while contemporary machine learning approaches frequently demand substantial feature engineering and struggle with temporal patterns in attack signatures. The vulnerability extends to 5G networks employing Time Division Duplex (TDD) or Frequency Division Duplex (FDD), where service quality may deteriorate due to deliberate interference. We introduce a novel U-shaped transformer architecture that leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to refine feature representations for improved wireless security. The training process is regularized by incorporating the output entropy uncertainty into the loss function, a mechanism inspired by the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable robust jamming detection techniques. The architecture features a modified transformer encoder specially designed to process critical wireless signal features, including Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal-to- Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) measurements. We complement this with a custom positional encoding mechanism that specifically accounts for the inherent periodicity of wireless signals,enabling a more accurate representation of temporal signal patterns. In addition, we propose a batch size scheduler and implement chunking techniques to optimize convergence for time series data. These advancements contribute to up to a ten times improvement in training speed within the advanced U-shaped encoder-decoder transformer model introduced in this study. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our entropy-based approach, achieving detection rates of 85.06% in NLoS scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Within an open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture, edge clouds (ECs) enable MC with low latency for users within their coverage area. However, ensuring seamless service continuity for transitional users-those moving between the coverage areas of neighboring ECs-poses challenges due to centralized processing demands. To address this, we formulate a problem facilitating soft handovers between ECs, ensuring seamless transitions while maintaining service continuity for all users. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (HMARL) algorithm to dynamically determine the optimal functional split configuration for transitional and non-transitional users. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional functional split in terms of the percentage of users maintaining service continuity, with at most 4% optimality gap. Additionally, HMARL achieves better scalability compared to the static baselines.</p></details> |  |

Manual radioactive target detection based on visual display or audible indication of gamma level is highly dependent on the ability of the surgeon to track and interpret the spatial information. This paper presents a learning-based method to realize the autonomous radiotracer detection in robot-assisted surgeries by navigating the probe to the radioactive target. We proposed novel hybrid approach that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with adaptive robotic scanning. The adaptive grid-based scanning could provide initial direction estimation while the DRL-based agent could efficiently navigate to the target utilising historical data. Simulation experiments demonstrate a 95% success rate, and improved efficiency and robustness compared to conventional techniques. Real-world evaluation on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) further confirms the feasibility of the approach, achieving an 80% success rate in radiotracer detection. This method has the potential to enhance consistency, reduce operator dependency, and improve procedural accuracy in radioguided surgeries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm, benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps. Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast simulation of diverse AD datasets. V-Max integrates a set of observation and reward functions, transformer-based encoders, and training pipelines. Additionally, it includes adversarial evaluation settings and an extensive set of evaluation metrics. Through a large-scale benchmark, we analyze how network architectures, observation functions, training data, and reward shaping impact RL performance.</p></details> |  |

Despite promising outcomes, current state-of-the-art PRL methods are hindered by sample inefficiency, necessitating tens of millions of program-environment interactions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel LLM-guided search framework (LLM-GS). Our key insight is to leverage the programming expertise and common sense reasoning of LLMs to enhance the efficiency of assumption-free, random-guessing search methods. We address the challenge of LLMs' inability to generate precise and grammatically correct programs in domain-specific languages (DSLs) by proposing a Pythonic-DSL strategy - an LLM is instructed to initially generate Python codes and then convert them into DSL programs. To further optimize the LLM-generated programs, we develop a search algorithm named Scheduled Hill Climbing, designed to efficiently explore the programmatic search space to improve the programs consistently. Experimental results in the Karel domain demonstrate our LLM-GS framework's superior effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive ablation studies further verify the critical role of our Pythonic-DSL strategy and Scheduled Hill Climbing algorithm. Moreover, we conduct experiments with two novel tasks, showing that LLM-GS enables users without programming skills and knowledge of the domain or DSL to describe the tasks in natural language to obtain performant programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Symmetry in RL-based Legged Locomotion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17320v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-free reinforcement learning is a promising approach for autonomously solving challenging robotics control problems, but faces exploration difficulty without information of the robot's kinematics and dynamics morphology. The under-exploration of multiple modalities with symmetric states leads to behaviors that are often unnatural and sub-optimal. This issue becomes particularly pronounced in the context of robotic systems with morphological symmetries, such as legged robots for which the resulting asymmetric and aperiodic behaviors compromise performance, robustness, and transferability to real hardware. To mitigate this challenge, we can leverage symmetry to guide and improve the exploration in policy learning via equivariance/invariance constraints. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of two approaches to incorporate symmetry: modifying the network architectures to be strictly equivariant/invariant, and leveraging data augmentation to approximate equivariant/invariant actor-critics. We implement the methods on challenging loco-manipulation and bipedal locomotion tasks and compare with an unconstrained baseline. We find that the strictly equivariant policy consistently outperforms other methods in sample efficiency and task performance in simulation. In addition, symmetry-incorporated approaches exhibit better gait quality, higher robustness and can be deployed zero-shot in real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |

Compared to traditional model-based control algorithms, reinforcement learning based algorithms demonstrate substantial advantages in handling complex tasks. Leveraging the large-scale parallel computing capabilities of GPUs, contemporary humanoid robots can undergo extensive parallel training in simulated environments. A physical simulation platform capable of large-scale parallel training is crucial for the development of humanoid robots. As one of the most complex robot forms, humanoid robots typically possess intricate mechanical structures, encompassing numerous series and parallel mechanisms. However, many reinforcement learning based humanoid robot control algorithms currently employ open-loop topologies during training, deferring the conversion to series-parallel structures until the sim2real phase. This approach is primarily due to the limitations of physics engines, as current GPU-based physics engines often only support open-loop topologies or have limited capabilities in simulating multi-rigid-body closed-loop topologies. For enabling reinforcement learning-based humanoid robot control algorithms to train in large-scale parallel environments, we propose a novel training method LiPS. By incorporating multi-rigid-body dynamics modeling in the simulation environment, we significantly reduce the sim2real gap and the difficulty of converting to parallel structures during model deployment, thereby robustly supporting large-scale reinforcement learning for humanoid robots.</p></details> |  |

With breakthroughs in various types of artificial intelligence algorithms, embodied intelligence, exemplified by humanoid robots, has been highly anticipated. The advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have significantly improved the motion control and generalization capabilities of humanoid robots. Simultaneously, the groundbreaking progress in large language models (LLM) and visual language models (VLM) has brought more possibilities and imagination to humanoid robots. LLM enables humanoid robots to understand complex tasks from language instructions and perform long-term task planning, while VLM greatly enhances the robots' understanding and interaction with their environment. This paper introduces \textcolor{magenta}{Trinity}, a novel AI system for humanoid robots that integrates RL, LLM, and VLM. By combining these technologies, Trinity enables efficient control of humanoid robots in complex environments.

| **[Evaluating Interpretable Reinforcement Learning by Distilling Policies into Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08322v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There exist applications of reinforcement learning like medicine where policies need to be ''interpretable'' by humans. User studies have shown that some policy classes might be more interpretable than others. However, it is costly to conduct human studies of policy interpretability. Furthermore, there is no clear definition of policy interpretabiliy, i.e., no clear metrics for interpretability and thus claims depend on the chosen definition. We tackle the problem of empirically evaluating policies interpretability without humans. Despite this lack of clear definition, researchers agree on the notions of ''simulatability'': policy interpretability should relate to how humans understand policy actions given states. To advance research in interpretable reinforcement learning, we contribute a new methodology to evaluate policy interpretability. This new methodology relies on proxies for simulatability that we use to conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of policy interpretability. We use imitation learning to compute baseline policies by distilling expert neural networks into small programs. We then show that using our methodology to evaluate the baselines interpretability leads to similar conclusions as user studies. We show that increasing interpretability does not necessarily reduce performances and can sometimes increase them. We also show that there is no policy class that better trades off interpretability and performance across tasks making it necessary for researcher to have methodologies for comparing policies interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages of main text, under review</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Information Loss in Tree-Based Reinforcement Learning via Direct Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08761v5)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen significant success across various domains, but its adoption is often limited by the black-box nature of neural network policies, making them difficult to interpret. In contrast, symbolic policies allow representing decision-making strategies in a compact and interpretable way. However, learning symbolic policies directly within on-policy methods remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce SYMPOL, a novel method for SYMbolic tree-based on-POLicy RL. SYMPOL employs a tree-based model integrated with a policy gradient method, enabling the agent to learn and adapt its actions while maintaining a high level of interpretability. We evaluate SYMPOL on a set of benchmark RL tasks, demonstrating its superiority over alternative tree-based RL approaches in terms of performance and interpretability. Unlike existing methods, it enables gradient-based, end-to-end learning of interpretable, axis-aligned decision trees within standard on-policy RL algorithms. Therefore, SYMPOL can become the foundation for a new class of interpretable RL based on decision trees. Our implementation is available under: https://github.com/s-marton/sympol</p></details> |  |
| **[Distillation-PPO: A Novel Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning Framework for Humanoid Robot Perceptive Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08299v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, humanoid robots have garnered significant attention from both academia and industry due to their high adaptability to environments and human-like characteristics. With the rapid advancement of reinforcement learning, substantial progress has been made in the walking control of humanoid robots. However, existing methods still face challenges when dealing with complex environments and irregular terrains. In the field of perceptive locomotion, existing approaches are generally divided into two-stage methods and end-to-end methods. Two-stage methods first train a teacher policy in a simulated environment and then use distillation techniques, such as DAgger, to transfer the privileged information learned as latent features or actions to the student policy. End-to-end methods, on the other hand, forgo the learning of privileged information and directly learn policies from a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) through reinforcement learning. However, due to the lack of supervision from a teacher policy, end-to-end methods often face difficulties in training and exhibit unstable performance in real-world applications. This paper proposes an innovative two-stage perceptive locomotion framework that combines the advantages of teacher policies learned in a fully observable Markov decision process (MDP) to regularize and supervise the student policy. At the same time, it leverages the characteristics of reinforcement learning to ensure that the student policy can continue to learn in a POMDP, thereby enhancing the model's upper bound. Our experimental results demonstrate that our two-stage training framework achieves higher training efficiency and stability in simulated environments, while also exhibiting better robustness and generalization capabilities in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, aligning discrete diffusion models with task-specific preferences remains challenging, particularly in scenarios where explicit reward functions are unavailable. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion DPO (D3PO), the first adaptation of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to discrete diffusion models formulated as continuous-time Markov chains. Our approach derives a novel loss function that directly fine-tunes the generative process using preference data while preserving fidelity to a reference distribution. We validate D3PO on a structured binary sequence generation task, demonstrating that the method effectively aligns model outputs with preferences while maintaining structural validity. Our results highlight that D3PO enables controlled fine-tuning without requiring explicit reward models, making it a practical alternative to reinforcement learning-based approaches. Future research will explore extending D3PO to more complex generative tasks, including language modeling and protein sequence generation, as well as investigating alternative noise schedules, such as uniform noising, to enhance flexibility across different applications.</p></details> |  |

However, there are three main challenges when using LLMs as foundational models for time series forecasting: (1) Cross-domain generalization. (2) Cross-modality alignment. (3) Error accumulation in autoregressive frameworks. To address these challenges, we proposed LangTime, a language-guided unified model for time series forecasting that incorporates cross-domain pre-training with reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning. Specifically, LangTime constructs Temporal Comprehension Prompts (TCPs), which include dataset-wise and channel-wise instructions, to facilitate domain adaptation and condense time series into a single token, enabling LLMs to understand better and align temporal data. To improve autoregressive forecasting, we introduce TimePPO, a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning algorithm. TimePPO mitigates error accumulation by leveraging a multidimensional rewards function tailored for time series and a repeat-based value estimation strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LangTime achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain forecasting performance, while TimePPO fine-tuning effectively enhances the stability and accuracy of autoregressive forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Although both can be formulated as tracking problems, their distinct state spaces and control strategies complicate a unified reward function. We propose a multitask deep reinforcement learning framework that leverages parallel simulation with IsaacGym and a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) policy to address both tasks effectively. Our multitask Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) approach achieves faster, more reliable learning and higher sample efficiency than single-task methods. We validate its real-world applicability by deploying the learned policy - a compact two-layer network with 24 neurons per layer - on a Pixhawk flight controller, achieving 400 Hz control without extra computational resources.

Humans primarily rely on embodied visual perception to safely navigate and interact with their surroundings, making it a valuable capability for RL agents. However, existing vision-based 3D benchmarks only consider simple navigation tasks. To address this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{HASARD}, a suite of diverse and complex tasks to $\textbf{HA}$rness $\textbf{SA}$fe $\textbf{R}$L with $\textbf{D}$oom, requiring strategic decision-making, comprehending spatial relationships, and predicting the short-term future. HASARD features three difficulty levels and two action spaces. An empirical evaluation of popular baseline methods demonstrates the benchmark's complexity, unique challenges, and reward-cost trade-offs. Visualizing agent navigation during training with top-down heatmaps provides insight into a method's learning process. Incrementally training across difficulty levels offers an implicit learning curriculum. HASARD is the first safe RL benchmark to exclusively target egocentric vision-based learning, offering a cost-effective and insightful way to explore the potential and boundaries of current and future safe RL methods.

Inspired by this breakthrough, we explore how RL can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capability of MLLMs. However, direct training with RL struggles to activate complex reasoning capabilities such as questioning and reflection in MLLMs, due to the absence of substantial high-quality multimodal reasoning data. To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1. To mitigate the optimization challenges caused by overthinking after cold start, we propose Progressive Thinking Suppression Training (PTST) strategy and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with the hard formatting result reward function to gradually refine the model's ability to learn correct and complex reasoning processes on a 10K multimodal math dataset. Comprehensive experiments show our model achieves an average improvement of $\sim$6% across various multimodal math reasoning benchmarks. Vision-R1-7B achieves a 73.5% accuracy on the widely used MathVista benchmark, which is only 0.4% lower than the leading reasoning model, OpenAI O1. The datasets and code will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-R1 .</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-RTL: Reinforcement-Based Meta-Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Commonsense Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19075v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta learning has been widely used to exploit rich-resource source tasks to improve the performance of low-resource target tasks. Unfortunately, most existing meta learning approaches treat different source tasks equally, ignoring the relatedness of source tasks to the target task in knowledge transfer. To mitigate this issue, we propose a reinforcement-based multi-source meta-transfer learning framework (Meta-RTL) for low-resource commonsense reasoning. In this framework, we present a reinforcement-based approach to dynamically estimating source task weights that measure the contribution of the corresponding tasks to the target task in the meta-transfer learning. The differences between the general loss of the meta model and task-specific losses of source-specific temporal meta models on sampled target data are fed into the policy network of the reinforcement learning module as rewards. The policy network is built upon LSTMs that capture long-term dependencies on source task weight estimation across meta learning iterations. We evaluate the proposed Meta-RTL using both BERT and ALBERT as the backbone of the meta model on three commonsense reasoning benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta-RTL substantially outperforms strong baselines and previous task selection strategies and achieves larger improvements on extremely low-resource settings.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced methods have shown promise in generalization and interoperability, they often neglect necessary multi-agent coordination. Therefore, we introduce the Cascading Cooperative Multi-agent (CCMA) framework, integrating RL for individual interactions, a fine-tuned LLM for regional cooperation, a reward function for global optimization, and the Retrieval-augmented Generation mechanism to dynamically optimize decision-making across complex driving scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the CCMA outperforms existing RL methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both micro and macro-level performance in complex driving environments.</p></details> |  |

Existing $\textit{end-to-end learning}$ methods for MILP generate values for a subset of decision variables and delegate the remaining problem to traditional MILP solvers. However, this approach often fails to guarantee solution feasibility (i.e., satisfying all constraints) due to inaccurate predictions and primarily focuses on binary decision variables. Satisfying all constraints is a prerequisite for obtaining the optimal solution, and the feasibility issue becomes even more critical with non-binary integer (integer, for short) variables. Thus, addressing the feasibility of MILP involving integer variables is crucial. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based solver that not only finds the first feasible solution but also incrementally discovers better feasible solutions without delegating the remainder to off-the-shelf solvers. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves (near-)optimal solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version (17 pages, 8 figures).

However, applying existing RL methods to step-distilled DMs is challenging for ultra-fast ($\le2$-step) image generation. Our analysis suggests several limitations of policy-based RL methods such as PPO or DPO toward this goal. Based on the insights, we propose fine-tuning DMs with learned differentiable surrogate rewards. Our method, named LaSRO, learns surrogate reward models in the latent space of SDXL to convert arbitrary rewards into differentiable ones for effective reward gradient guidance. LaSRO leverages pre-trained latent DMs for reward modeling and tailors reward optimization for $\le2$-step image generation with efficient off-policy exploration. LaSRO is effective and stable for improving ultra-fast image generation with different reward objectives, outperforming popular RL methods including DDPO and Diffusion-DPO. We further show LaSRO's connection to value-based RL, providing theoretical insights. See our webpage \href{https://sites.google.com/view/lasro}{here}.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

We propose LLM4MAC, a novel framework that harnesses large language models (LLMs) within a reinforcement learning paradigm to drive MAC protocol emergence. By reformulating uplink data transmission scheduling as a semantics-generalized partially observable Markov game (POMG), LLM4MAC encodes network operations in natural language, while proximal policy optimization (PPO) ensures continuous alignment with the evolving network dynamics. A structured identity embedding (SIE) mechanism further enables robust coordination among heterogeneous agents. Extensive simulations demonstrate that on top of a compact LLM, which is purposefully selected to balance performance with resource efficiency, the protocol emerging from LLM4MAC outperforms comparative baselines in throughput and generalization.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Toward Stable World Models: Measuring and Addressing World Instability in Generative Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08122v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel study on enhancing the capability of preserving the content in world models, focusing on a property we term World Stability. Recent diffusion-based generative models have advanced the synthesis of immersive and realistic environments that are pivotal for applications such as reinforcement learning and interactive game engines. However, while these models excel in quality and diversity, they often neglect the preservation of previously generated scenes over time--a shortfall that can introduce noise into agent learning and compromise performance in safety-critical settings. In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework that measures world stability by having world models perform a sequence of actions followed by their inverses to return to their initial viewpoint, thereby quantifying the consistency between the starting and ending observations. Our comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art diffusion-based world models reveals significant challenges in achieving high world stability. Moreover, we investigate several improvement strategies to enhance world stability. Our results underscore the importance of world stability in world modeling and provide actionable insights for future research in this domain.</p></details> | Preprint |

Despite its empirical advantage, the theoretical difference between KL-regularized RL and standard RL remains largely under-explored. While there is a recent line of work on the theoretical analysis of KL-regularized objective in decision making \citep{xiong2024iterative, xie2024exploratory,zhao2024sharp}, these analyses either reduce to the traditional RL setting or rely on strong coverage assumptions. In this paper, we propose an optimism-based KL-regularized online contextual bandit algorithm, and provide a novel analysis of its regret. By carefully leveraging the benign optimization landscape induced by the KL-regularization and the optimistic reward estimation, our algorithm achieves an $\mathcal{O}\big(\eta\log (N_{\mathcal R} T)\cdot d_{\mathcal R}\big)$ logarithmic regret bound, where $\eta, N_{\mathcal R},T,d_{\mathcal R}$ denote the KL-regularization parameter, the cardinality of the reward function class, number of rounds, and the complexity of the reward function class. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm and analysis to reinforcement learning by developing a novel decomposition over transition steps and also obtain a similar logarithmic regret bound.</p></details> |  |

Existing legal LLMs face two primary challenges. Firstly, their design and evaluation are predominantly driven by computer science perspectives, leading to insufficient incorporation of legal expertise and logic, which is crucial for high-precision legal applications, such as handling complex prosecutorial tasks. Secondly, these models often underperform due to a lack of comprehensive training data from the legal domain, limiting their ability to effectively address real-world legal scenarios. To address this, we first compile millions of legal documents covering over 20 types of crimes from 31 provinces in China for model training. From the extensive dataset, we further select high-quality for supervised fine-tuning, ensuring enhanced relevance and precision. The model further undergoes large-scale reinforcement learning without additional supervision, emphasizing the enhancement of its reasoning capabilities and explainability. To validate its effectiveness in complex legal applications, we also conduct human evaluations with legal experts. We develop fine-tuned models based on DeepSeek-R1-Distilled versions, available in three dense configurations: 14B, 32B, and 70B.</p></details> |  |

External memory mechanisms have been proposed to address this limitation, enabling LLMs to maintain conversational continuity. However, existing approaches struggle with two key challenges. First, rigid memory granularity fails to capture the natural semantic structure of conversations, leading to fragmented and incomplete representations. Second, fixed retrieval mechanisms cannot adapt to diverse dialogue contexts and user interaction patterns. In this work, we propose Reflective Memory Management (RMM), a novel mechanism for long-term dialogue agents, integrating forward- and backward-looking reflections: (1) Prospective Reflection, which dynamically summarizes interactions across granularities-utterances, turns, and sessions-into a personalized memory bank for effective future retrieval, and (2) Retrospective Reflection, which iteratively refines the retrieval in an online reinforcement learning (RL) manner based on LLMs' cited evidence. Experiments show that RMM demonstrates consistent improvement across various metrics and benchmarks. For example, RMM shows more than 10% accuracy improvement over the baseline without memory management on the LongMemEval dataset.</p></details> |  |

While rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) excels in text-only domains, its multimodal extension confronts two critical barriers: (1) data limitations due to ambiguous answers and scarce complex reasoning examples, and (2) degraded foundational reasoning induced by multimodal pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LMM-R1}, a two-stage framework adapting rule-based RL for multimodal reasoning through \textbf{Foundational Reasoning Enhancement (FRE)} followed by \textbf{Multimodal Generalization Training (MGT)}. The FRE stage first strengthens reasoning abilities using text-only data with rule-based RL, then the MGT stage generalizes these reasoning capabilities to multimodal domains. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct-3B demonstrate that LMM-R1 achieves 4.83\% and 4.5\% average improvements over baselines in multimodal and text-only benchmarks, respectively, with a 3.63\% gain in complex Football Game tasks. These results validate that text-based reasoning enhancement enables effective multimodal generalization, offering a data-efficient paradigm that bypasses costly high-quality multimodal training data.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel vision-language-action (VLA) model, mixture of robotic experts (MoRE), for quadruped robots that aim to introduce reinforcement learning (RL) for fine-tuning large-scale VLA models with a large amount of mixed-quality data. MoRE integrates multiple low-rank adaptation modules as distinct experts within a dense multi-modal large language model (MLLM), forming a sparse-activated mixture-of-experts model. This design enables the model to effectively adapt to a wide array of downstream tasks. Moreover, we employ a reinforcement learning-based training objective to train our model as a Q-function after deeply exploring the structural properties of our tasks. Effective learning from automatically collected mixed-quality data enhances data efficiency and model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE outperforms all baselines across six different skills and exhibits superior generalization capabilities in out-of-distribution scenarios. We further validate our method in real-world scenarios, confirming the practicality of our approach and laying a solid foundation for future research on multi-task learning in quadruped robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

We train our ReasonFlux-32B model with only 8 GPUs and introduces three innovations: (i) a structured and generic thought template library, containing around 500 high-level thought templates capable of generalizing to similar or relevant reasoning problems; (ii) performing hierarchical reinforcement learning on a sequence of thought templates instead of long CoTs, optimizing a base LLM to plan out an optimal template trajectory for gradually handling complex problems; (iii) a brand new inference scaling system that enables hierarchical LLM reasoning by adaptively scaling thought templates at inference time.

| **[Regulatory DNA sequence Design with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07981v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as promoters and enhancers, are relatively short DNA sequences that directly regulate gene expression. The fitness of CREs, measured by their ability to modulate gene expression, highly depends on the nucleotide sequences, especially specific motifs known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Designing high-fitness CREs is crucial for therapeutic and bioengineering applications. Current CRE design methods are limited by two major drawbacks: (1) they typically rely on iterative optimization strategies that modify existing sequences and are prone to local optima, and (2) they lack the guidance of biological prior knowledge in sequence optimization. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a generative approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune a pre-trained autoregressive (AR) model. Our method incorporates data-driven biological priors by deriving computational inference-based rewards that simulate the addition of activator TFBSs and removal of repressor TFBSs, which are then integrated into the RL process. We evaluate our method on promoter design tasks in two yeast media conditions and enhancer design tasks for three human cell types, demonstrating its ability to generate high-fitness CREs while maintaining sequence diversity.

| **[DaD: Distilled Reinforcement Learning for Diverse Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07347v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Keypoints are what enable Structure-from-Motion (SfM) systems to scale to thousands of images. However, designing a keypoint detection objective is a non-trivial task, as SfM is non-differentiable. Typically, an auxiliary objective involving a descriptor is optimized. This however induces a dependency on the descriptor, which is undesirable. In this paper we propose a fully self-supervised and descriptor-free objective for keypoint detection, through reinforcement learning. To ensure training does not degenerate, we leverage a balanced top-K sampling strategy. While this already produces competitive models, we find that two qualitatively different types of detectors emerge, which are only able to detect light and dark keypoints respectively. To remedy this, we train a third detector, DaD, that optimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the pointwise maximum of both light and dark detectors. Our approach significantly improve upon SotA across a range of benchmarks. Code and model weights are publicly available at https://github.com/parskatt/dad</p></details> | fixed incorrect url |
| **[Categorical semantics of compositional reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13687v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional knowledge representations in reinforcement learning (RL) facilitate modular, interpretable, and safe task specifications. However, generating compositional models requires the characterization of minimal assumptions for the robustness of the compositionality feature, especially in the case of functional decompositions. Using a categorical point of view, we develop a knowledge representation framework for a compositional theory of RL. Our approach relies on the theoretical study of the category $\mathsf{MDP}$, whose objects are Markov decision processes (MDPs) acting as models of tasks. The categorical semantics models the compositionality of tasks through the application of pushout operations akin to combining puzzle pieces. As a practical application of these pushout operations, we introduce zig-zag diagrams that rely on the compositional guarantees engendered by the category $\mathsf{MDP}$. We further prove that properties of the category $\mathsf{MDP}$ unify concepts, such as enforcing safety requirements and exploiting symmetries, generalizing previous abstraction theories for RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Task Allocation in Multi-Human Multi-Robot Teams under Team Heterogeneity and Dynamic Information Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13824v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task allocation in multi-human multi-robot (MH-MR) teams presents significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of team members, the dynamics of task execution, and the information uncertainty of operational states. Existing approaches often fail to address these challenges simultaneously, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle this, we propose ATA-HRL, an adaptive task allocation framework using hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), which incorporates initial task allocation (ITA) that leverages team heterogeneity and conditional task reallocation in response to dynamic operational states. Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary state representation learning task to manage information uncertainty and enhance task execution. Through an extensive case study in large-scale environmental monitoring tasks, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[PrefMMT: Modeling Human Preferences in Preference-based Reinforcement Learning with Multimodal Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13683v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) shows promise in aligning robot behaviors with human preferences, but its success depends heavily on the accurate modeling of human preferences through reward models. Most methods adopt Markovian assumptions for preference modeling (PM), which overlook the temporal dependencies within robot behavior trajectories that impact human evaluations. While recent works have utilized sequence modeling to mitigate this by learning sequential non-Markovian rewards, they ignore the multimodal nature of robot trajectories, which consist of elements from two distinctive modalities: state and action. As a result, they often struggle to capture the complex interplay between these modalities that significantly shapes human preferences. In this paper, we propose a multimodal sequence modeling approach for PM by disentangling state and action modalities. We introduce a multimodal transformer network, named PrefMMT, which hierarchically leverages intra-modal temporal dependencies and inter-modal state-action interactions to capture complex preference patterns. We demonstrate that PrefMMT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PM baselines on locomotion tasks from the D4RL benchmark and manipulation tasks from the Meta-World benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalization in Human-Robot Interaction through Preference-based Action Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13822v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has shown significant promise for personalization in human-robot interaction (HRI) by explicitly integrating human preferences into the robot learning process. However, existing practices often require training a personalized robot policy from scratch, resulting in inefficient use of human feedback. In this paper, we propose preference-based action representation learning (PbARL), an efficient fine-tuning method that decouples common task structure from preference by leveraging pre-trained robot policies. Instead of directly fine-tuning the pre-trained policy with human preference, PbARL uses it as a reference for an action representation learning task that maximizes the mutual information between the pre-trained source domain and the target user preference-aligned domain. This approach allows the robot to personalize its behaviors while preserving original task performance and eliminates the need for extensive prior information from the source domain, thereby enhancing efficiency and practicality in real-world HRI scenarios. Empirical results on the Assistive Gym benchmark and a real-world user study (N=8) demonstrate the benefits of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

The associated Bellman operator of the problem not being a contraction makes the algorithm design challenging. Previous approaches either suffer from computational inefficiency or require strong assumptions on dynamics, such as ergodicity, for achieving a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm that achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with computational complexity polynomial in the problem parameters, without making strong assumptions on dynamics. Our approach approximates the average-reward setting by a discounted MDP with a carefully chosen discounting factor, and then applies an optimistic value iteration. We propose an algorithmic structure that plans for a nonstationary policy through optimistic value iteration and follows that policy until a specified information metric in the collected data doubles. Additionally, we introduce a value function clipping procedure for limiting the span of the value function for sample efficiency.</p></details> |  |

To provide varying Quality of Service (QoS) for these traffic types, TSN incorporates different scheduling and shaping mechanisms. However, assigning traffic types to the proper scheduler or shaper, known as Traffic-Type Assignment (TTA), is a known NP-hard problem. Relying solely on domain expertise to make these design decisions can be inefficient, especially in complex network scenarios. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept highlighting the advantages of a learning-based approach to the TTA problem. We formulate an optimization model for TTA in TSN and develop a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model, called ``TTASelector'', to assign traffic types to TSN flows efficiently. Using synthetic and realistic test cases, our evaluation shows that TTASelector assigns a higher number of traffic types to HRT and SRT flows compared to the state-of-the-art Tabu Search-based metaheuristic method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in technical session at the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Right Place, Right Time! Dynamizing Topological Graphs for Embodied Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09905v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Navigation tasks often involve constructing topological graphs of a scene during exploration to facilitate high-level planning and decision-making for execution in continuous environments. Prior literature makes the assumption of static graphs with stationary targets, which does not hold in many real-world environments with moving objects. To address this, we present a novel formulation generalizing navigation to dynamic environments by introducing structured object transitions to dynamize static topological graphs called Object Transition Graphs (OTGs). OTGs simulate portable targets following structured routes inspired by human habits. We apply this technique to Matterport3D (MP3D), a popular simulator for evaluating embodied tasks. On these dynamized OTGs, we establish a navigation benchmark by evaluating Oracle-based, Reinforcement Learning, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches on a multi-object finding task. Further, we quantify agent adaptability, and make key inferences such as agents employing learned decision-making strategies generalize better than those relying on privileged oracle knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to introduce structured temporal dynamism on topological graphs for studying generalist embodied navigation policies. The code and dataset for our OTGs will be made publicly available to foster research on embodied navigation in dynamic scenes.</p></details> | 18 |
| **[The Distributional Reward Critic Framework for Reinforcement Learning Under Perturbed Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05710v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reward signal plays a central role in defining the desired behaviors of agents in reinforcement learning (RL). Rewards collected from realistic environments could be perturbed, corrupted, or noisy due to an adversary, sensor error, or because they come from subjective human feedback. Thus, it is important to construct agents that can learn under such rewards. Existing methodologies for this problem make strong assumptions, including that the perturbation is known in advance, clean rewards are accessible, or that the perturbation preserves the optimal policy. We study a new, more general, class of unknown perturbations, and introduce a distributional reward critic framework for estimating reward distributions and perturbations during training. Our proposed methods are compatible with any RL algorithm. Despite their increased generality, we show that they achieve comparable or better rewards than existing methods in a variety of environments, including those with clean rewards. Under the challenging and generalized perturbations we study, we win/tie the highest return in 44/48 tested settings (compared to 11/48 for the best baseline). Our results broaden and deepen our ability to perform RL in reward-perturbed environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Group Fairness in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07817v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses a critical societal consideration in the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL): ensuring equitable outcomes across different demographic groups in multi-task settings. While previous work has explored fairness in single-task RL, many real-world applications are multi-task in nature and require policies to maintain fairness across all tasks. We introduce a novel formulation of multi-task group fairness in RL and propose a constrained optimization algorithm that explicitly enforces fairness constraints across multiple tasks simultaneously. We have shown that our proposed algorithm does not violate fairness constraints with high probability and with sublinear regret in the finite-horizon episodic setting. Through experiments in RiverSwim and MuJoCo environments, we demonstrate that our approach better ensures group fairness across multiple tasks compared to previous methods that lack explicit multi-task fairness constraints in both the finite-horizon setting and the infinite-horizon setting. Our results show that the proposed algorithm achieves smaller fairness gaps while maintaining comparable returns across different demographic groups and tasks, suggesting its potential for addressing fairness concerns in real-world multi-task RL applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning Enables Parameter Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05126v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) aims to endow a single agent with the ability to perform well on multiple tasks. Recent works have focused on developing novel sophisticated architectures to improve performance, often resulting in larger models; it is unclear, however, whether the performance gains are a consequence of the architecture design itself or the extra parameters. We argue that gains are mostly due to scale by demonstrating that naively scaling up a simple MTRL baseline to match parameter counts outperforms the more sophisticated architectures, and these gains benefit most from scaling the critic over the actor. Additionally, we explore the training stability advantages that come with task diversity, demonstrating that increasing the number of tasks can help mitigate plasticity loss. Our findings suggest that MTRL's simultaneous training across multiple tasks provides a natural framework for beneficial parameter scaling in reinforcement learning, challenging the need for complex architectural innovations.</p></details> |  |

Framing it as a reinforcement learning (RL) task is a way to challenge the human-designed heuristics of state-of-the-art provers and to instead automatically evolve -- just from prover experiences -- their potentially optimal replacement. In this work, we present a neural network architecture for scoring clauses for clause selection that is powerful yet efficient to evaluate. Following RL principles to make design decisions, we integrate the network into the Vampire theorem prover and train it from successful proof attempts. An experiment on the diverse TPTP benchmark finds the neurally guided prover improve over a baseline strategy, from which it initially learns--in terms of the number of in-training-unseen problems solved under a practically relevant, short CPU instruction limit--by 20%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages main text, 3 page bibliography, 6 page appendix</p></details> |
| **[Lessons learned from field demonstrations of model predictive control and reinforcement learning for residential and commercial HVAC: A review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05022v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large body of simulation research suggests that model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) in residential and commercial buildings could reduce energy costs, pollutant emissions, and strain on power grids. Despite this potential, neither MPC nor RL has seen widespread industry adoption. Field demonstrations could accelerate MPC and RL adoption by providing real-world data that support the business case for deployment. This paper reviews 24 field demonstrations of MPC and RL in residential buildings and 80 in commercial buildings. After presenting demographic information -- such as experiment scopes, locations, and durations -- this paper analyzes experiment protocols and their influence on performance estimates. We find that 71% of the reviewed field demonstrations use experiment protocols that may lead to unreliable performance estimates. Over the remaining 29% that we view as reliable, the weighted-average cost savings, weighted by experiment duration, are 16% in residential buildings and 13% in commercial buildings. While these savings are potentially attractive, making the business case for MPC and RL also requires characterizing the costs of deployment, operation, and maintenance. Only 13 of the 104 reviewed papers report these costs or discuss related challenges. Based on these observations, we recommend directions for future field research, including: Improving experiment protocols; reporting deployment, operation, and maintenance costs; designing algorithms and instrumentation to reduce these costs; controlling HVAC equipment alongside other distributed energy resources; and pursuing emerging objectives such as peak shaving, arbitraging wholesale energy prices, and providing power grid reliability services.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Through Optimistic Thompson Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04988v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning complex robot behavior through interactions with the environment necessitates principled exploration. Effective strategies should prioritize exploring regions of the state-action space that maximize rewards, with optimistic exploration emerging as a promising direction aligned with this idea and enabling sample-efficient reinforcement learning. However, existing methods overlook a crucial aspect: the need for optimism to be informed by a belief connecting the reward and state. To address this, we propose a practical, theoretically grounded approach to optimistic exploration based on Thompson sampling. Our model structure is the first that allows for reasoning about joint uncertainty over transitions and rewards. We apply our method on a set of MuJoCo and VMAS continuous control tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that optimistic exploration significantly accelerates learning in environments with sparse rewards, action penalties, and difficult-to-explore regions. Furthermore, we provide insights into when optimism is beneficial and emphasize the critical role of model uncertainty in guiding exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appearing in ICLR, 2025</p></details> |

In autonomous driving, recent end-to-end models have greatly improved planning performance but still struggle with long-tailed problems due to limited common sense and reasoning abilities. Some studies integrate vision-language models (VLMs) into autonomous driving, but they typically rely on pre-trained models with simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on driving data, without further exploration of training strategies or optimizations specifically tailored for planning. In this paper, we propose AlphaDrive, a RL and reasoning framework for VLMs in autonomous driving. AlphaDrive introduces four GRPO-based RL rewards tailored for planning and employs a two-stage planning reasoning training strategy that combines SFT with RL. As a result, AlphaDrive significantly improves both planning performance and training efficiency compared to using only SFT or without reasoning. Moreover, we are also excited to discover that, following RL training, AlphaDrive exhibits some emergent multimodal planning capabilities, which is critical for improving driving safety and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, AlphaDrive is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with planning reasoning into autonomous driving. Code will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/hustvl/AlphaDrive</p></details> |

Consequently, the development of classification systems such as DetectGPT has become vital. These detectors are vulnerable to evasion techniques, as demonstrated in an experimental series: Systematic changes of the generative models' temperature proofed shallow learning-detectors to be the least reliable. Fine-tuning the generative model via reinforcement learning circumvented BERT-based-detectors. Finally, rephrasing led to a >90\% evasion of zero-shot-detectors like DetectGPT, although texts stayed highly similar to the original. A comparison with existing work highlights the better performance of the presented methods. Possible implications for society and further research are discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reliable Self-Organized Distributed Complex Network for Communication of Smart Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07702v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaboration is a fundamental and essential characteristic of many complex systems, ranging from ant colonies to human societies. Each component within a complex system interacts with others, even at a distance, to accomplish a given task. A network of collaboration can be defined to study the collective behavior of such systems within the framework of complex networks. The nodes in these networks may represent simple organisms or more sophisticated intelligent agents, such as humans. In this study, we utilize intelligent agents (nodes) trained through reinforcement learning techniques to establish connections with their neighbors, ultimately leading to the emergence of a large-scale communication cluster. Notably, there is no centralized administrator; instead, agents must adjust their connections based on information obtained from local observations. The connection strategy is formulated using a physical Hamiltonian, thereby categorizing this intelligent system under the paradigm of "Physics-Guided Machine Learning".</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07572v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training models to effectively use test-time compute is crucial for improving the reasoning performance of LLMs. Current methods mostly do so via fine-tuning on search traces or running RL with 0/1 outcome reward, but do these approaches efficiently utilize test-time compute? Would these approaches continue to scale as the budget improves? In this paper, we try to answer these questions. We formalize the problem of optimizing test-time compute as a meta-reinforcement learning (RL) problem, which provides a principled perspective on spending test-time compute. This perspective enables us to view the long output stream from the LLM as consisting of several episodes run at test time and leads us to use a notion of cumulative regret over output tokens as a way to measure the efficacy of test-time compute. Akin to how RL algorithms can best tradeoff exploration and exploitation over training, minimizing cumulative regret would also provide the best balance between exploration and exploitation in the token stream. While we show that state-of-the-art models do not minimize regret, one can do so by maximizing a dense reward bonus in conjunction with the outcome 0/1 reward RL. This bonus is the ''progress'' made by each subsequent block in the output stream, quantified by the change in the likelihood of eventual success. Using these insights, we develop Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, or MRT, a new class of fine-tuning methods for optimizing test-time compute. MRT leads to a 2-3x relative gain in performance and roughly a 1.5x gain in token efficiency for math reasoning compared to outcome-reward RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling the Centaur: Human-Machine Synergy in Sequential Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18593v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of collective intelligence studies how teams can achieve better results than any of the team members alone. The special case of human-machine teams carries unique challenges in this regard. For example, human teams often achieve synergy by communicating to discover their relative advantages, which is not an option if the team partner is an unexplainable deep neural network. Between 2005-2008 a set of "freestyle" chess tournaments were held, in which human-machine teams known as "centaurs", outperformed the best humans and best machines alone. Centaur players reported that they identified relative advantages between themselves and their chess program, even though the program was superhuman. Inspired by this and leveraging recent open-source models, we study human-machine like teams in chess. A human behavioral clone ("Maia") and a pure self-play RL-trained chess engine ("Leela") were composed into a team using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. By directing our research question at the selection mechanism of the MoE, we could isolate the issue of extracting relative advantages without knowledge sharing. We show that in principle, there is high potential for synergy between human and machine in a complex sequential decision environment such as chess. Furthermore, we show that an expert can identify only a small part of these relative advantages, and that the contribution of its subject matter expertise in doing so saturates quickly. This is probably due to the "curse of knowledge" phenomenon. We also train a network to recognize relative advantages using reinforcement learning, without chess expertise, and it outdoes the expert. Our experiments are repeated in asymmetric teams, in which identifying relative advantages is more challenging. Our findings contribute to the study of collective intelligence and human-centric AI.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) enable flexible expression of such intentions through natural language, allowing queries to guide visual reasoning processes. Frameworks like Visual Chain-of-Thought have demonstrated the benefit of incorporating explicit reasoning steps, where the model predicts a focus region before answering a query. However, existing approaches rely heavily on supervised training with annotated intermediate bounding boxes, which severely limits scalability due to the combinatorial explosion of intention-region pairs. To overcome this limitation, we propose VisRL, the first framework that applies reinforcement learning (RL) to the problem of intention-driven visual perception. VisRL optimizes the entire visual reasoning process using only reward signals. By treating intermediate focus selection as a internal decision optimized through trial-and-error, our method eliminates the need for costly region annotations while aligning more closely with how humans learn to perceive the world. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that VisRL consistently outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating both its effectiveness and its strong generalization across different LMMs. Our code is available at this [URL](https://github.com/zhangquanchen/VisRL).</p></details> | 18pages,11 figures |

However, these policies have been shown to loss of plasticity when extended to long-term learning in non-stationary environments. For example, the standard proximal policy optimization (PPO) policy is observed to collapse in long-term training settings and lead to significant control performance degradation. To address this problem, this work proposes a cost-aware framework that uses a retrospective cost mechanism (RECOM) to balance rewards and losses in RL training with a non-stationary environment. Using a cost gradient relation between rewards and losses, our framework dynamically updates the learning rate to actively train the control policy in a disturbed wind environment. Our experimental results show that our framework learned a policy for the hovering task without policy collapse in variable wind conditions and has a successful result of 11.29% less dormant units than L2 regularization with PPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demonstration-Enhanced Adaptive Multi-Objective Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04857v4)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-aligned robot navigation in human environments is typically achieved through learning-based approaches, utilizing user feedback or demonstrations for personalization. However, personal preferences are subject to change and might even be context-dependent. Yet traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches with static reward functions often fall short in adapting to varying user preferences, inevitably reflecting demonstrations once training is completed. This paper introduces a structured framework that combines demonstration-based learning with multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL). To ensure real-world applicability, our approach allows for dynamic adaptation of the robot navigation policy to changing user preferences without retraining. It fluently modulates the amount of demonstration data reflection and other preference-related objectives. Through rigorous evaluations, including a baseline comparison and sim-to-real transfer on two robots, we demonstrate our framework's capability to adapt to user preferences accurately while achieving high navigational performance in terms of collision avoidance and goal pursuance.</p></details> |  |

Recent works in Reinforcement Learning (RL) take notably advantage of extensive simulations to produce efficient robot control. State-of-the-art servo actuator models generally fail at capturing the complex friction dynamics of these systems. This limits the transferability of simulated behaviors to real-world applications. In this work, we present extended friction models that allow to more accurately simulate servo actuator dynamics. We propose a comprehensive analysis of various friction models, present a method for identifying model parameters using recorded trajectories from a pendulum test bench, and demonstrate how these models can be integrated into physics engines. The proposed friction models are validated on four distinct servo actuators and tested on 2R manipulators, showing significant improvements in accuracy over the standard Coulomb-Viscous model. Our results highlight the importance of considering advanced friction effects in the simulation of servo actuators to enhance the realism and reliability of robotic simulations.</p></details> |  |

Rewards in RL for Cyber Defence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03245v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The last few years have seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber defence agents based on deep reinforcement learning. Such agents are typically trained in a cyber gym environment, also known as a cyber simulator, at least 32 of which have already been built. Most, if not all cyber gyms provide dense "scaffolded" reward functions which combine many penalties or incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Whilst dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments, yielding seemingly effective strategies from relatively few environment steps; they are also known to bias the solutions an agent can find, potentially towards suboptimal solutions. This is especially a problem in complex cyber environments where policy weaknesses may not be noticed until exploited by an adversary. In this work we set out to evaluate whether sparse reward functions might enable training more effective cyber defence agents. Towards this goal we first break down several evaluation limitations in existing work by proposing a ground truth evaluation score that goes beyond the standard RL paradigm used to train and evaluate agents. By adapting a well-established cyber gym to accommodate our methodology and ground truth score, we propose and evaluate two sparse reward mechanisms and compare them with a typical dense reward. Our evaluation considers a range of network sizes, from 2 to 50 nodes, and both reactive and proactive defensive actions. Our results show that sparse rewards, particularly positive reinforcement for an uncompromised network state, enable the training of more effective cyber defence agents. Furthermore, we show that sparse rewards provide more stable training than dense rewards, and that both effectiveness and training stability are robust to a variety of cyber environment considerations.</p></details> | 4 Pages |
| **[Is a Good Foundation Necessary for Efficient Reinforcement Learning? The Computational Role of the Base Model in Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07453v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model alignment (or, reinforcement learning) techniques that leverage active exploration -- deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, informative responses -- offer the promise of super-human capabilities. However, current understanding of algorithm design primitives for computationally efficient exploration with language models is limited. To better understand how to leverage access to powerful pre-trained generative models to improve the efficiency of exploration, we introduce a new computational framework for RL with language models, in which the learner interacts with the model through a sampling oracle. Focusing on the linear softmax model parameterization, we provide new results that reveal the computational-statistical tradeoffs of efficient exploration: 1. Necessity of coverage: Coverage refers to the extent to which the pre-trained model covers near-optimal responses -- a form of hidden knowledge. We show that coverage, while not necessary for data efficiency, lower bounds the runtime of any algorithm in our framework. 2. Inference-time exploration: We introduce a new algorithm, SpannerSampling, which obtains optimal data efficiency and is computationally efficient whenever the pre-trained model enjoys sufficient coverage, matching our lower bound. SpannerSampling leverages inference-time computation with the pre-trained model to reduce the effective search space for exploration. 3. Insufficiency of training-time interventions: We contrast the result above by showing that training-time interventions that produce proper policies cannot achieve similar guarantees in polynomial time. 4. Computational benefits of multi-turn exploration: Finally, we show that under additional representational assumptions, one can achieve improved runtime (replacing sequence-level coverage with token-level coverage) through multi-turn exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRESS: Diffusion Reasoning-based Reward Shaping Scheme For Intelligent Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07433v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network optimization remains fundamental in wireless communications, with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions gaining widespread adoption. As Sixth-Generation (6G) communication networks pursue full-scenario coverage, optimization in complex extreme environments presents unprecedented challenges. The dynamic nature of these environments, combined with physical constraints, makes it difficult for AI solutions such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to obtain effective reward feedback for the training process. However, many existing DRL-based network optimization studies overlook this challenge through idealized environment settings. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of Generative AI (GenAI), especially diffusion models, in capturing complex latent distributions, we introduce a novel Diffusion Reasoning-based Reward Shaping Scheme (DRESS) to achieve robust network optimization. By conditioning on observed environmental states and executed actions, DRESS leverages diffusion models' multi-step denoising process as a form of deep reasoning, progressively refining latent representations to generate meaningful auxiliary reward signals that capture patterns of network systems. Moreover, DRESS is designed for seamless integration with any DRL framework, allowing DRESS-aided DRL (DRESSed-DRL) to enable stable and efficient DRL training even under extreme network environments. Experimental results demonstrate that DRESSed-DRL achieves about 1.5x times faster convergence than its original version in sparse-reward wireless environments and significant performance improvements in multiple general DRL benchmark environments compared to baseline methods. The code of DRESS is available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/DRESS.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Interplay of AI-and-RAN: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Converged 6G Platform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07420v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The concept of AI-RAN as specified by the AI-RAN alliance is geared to explore a converged 6G platform that can support management, orchestration, and deployment of both AI and RAN workloads. This concept is central to the development of a 6G architecture that aims to exploit the accelerated compute capabilities for supporting both real-time signal processing and offloading of Generative AI (GenAI) workloads. However, both the architectural framework required to support this vision and the dynamic resource allocation strategy are still in their infancy. The O-RAN architecture intrinsically allows cloud-native disaggregated implementation. Consequently, we explore a framework that can allow orchestration of AI-and-RAN workloads by expanding the Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (NRT-RIC) within O-RAN. The framework incorporates a monitoring xApp that tracks RAN KPIs and exposes radio analytics to the proposed E2E orchestrator via a recently introduced Y1 interface. The orchestrator implements a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically allocate critical computing resources, e.g., Multi-Instance GPUs (MIGs), between latency-sensitive RAN network functions and computationally intensive AI workloads on shared RAN infrastructure. The proposed framework provides insight on how the traditional RAN architecture can be evolved to inherently support emerging GenAI workloads. Our framework prioritizes the real-time requirements of RAN workloads while maintaining efficient resource sharing for AI applications. The simulation results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework, as it meets nearly 99% of the requests for RAN workload while effectively supporting AI workloads and achieving 100% utilization of the RAN infrastructure resources in a dynamic environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the IEEE INFOCOM 2025 Workshop and will appear in the IEEE INFOCOM 2025 proceedings</p></details> |

A multi-objective optimization framework is employed, integrating HOMER Pro for system sizing with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Sensitivity analyses are conducted to evaluate the system performance under varying load demand and renewable energy fluctuations, while an economic sensitivity assessment examines the impact of electricity prices and capital costs on the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). The proposed microgrid configuration achieves high reliability, satisfying 100% of the load, even under adverse weather conditions. The proposed framework attains an efficiency of 91.99% while maintaining a carbon footprint of 302,747 kg/year, which is approximately 95% lower than that of the grid system. The economic analysis indicates a net present cost (NPC) of $4.83M with a competitive LCOE of $0.208/kWh. In addition, the operation cost is $201,473 per year with a capital investment of $1.42M, rendering it a financially viable alternative to conventional grid-dependent systems.This work can be valuable in identifying effective solutions for supplying reliable and cost-effective power to regional and remote areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[PER-DPP Sampling Framework and Its Application in Path Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07411v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous navigation in intelligent mobile systems represents a core research focus within artificial intelligence-driven robotics. Contemporary path planning approaches face constraints in dynamic environmental responsiveness and multi-objective task scalability, limiting their capacity to address growing intelligent operation requirements. Decision-centric reinforcement learning frameworks, capitalizing on their unique strengths in adaptive environmental interaction and self-optimization, have gained prominence in advanced control system research. This investigation introduces methodological improvements to address sample homogeneity challenges in reinforcement learning experience replay mechanisms. By incorporating determinant point processes (DPP) for diversity assessment, we develop a dual-criteria sampling framework with adaptive selection protocols. This approach resolves representation bias in conventional prioritized experience replay (PER) systems while preserving algorithmic interoperability, offering improved decision optimization for dynamic operational scenarios. Key contributions comprise: Develop a hybrid sampling paradigm (PER-DPP) combining priority sequencing with diversity maximization.Based on this,create an integrated optimization scheme (PER-DPP-Elastic DQN) merging diversity-aware sampling with adaptive step-size regulation. Comparative simulations in 2D navigation scenarios demonstrate that the elastic step-size component temporarily delays initial convergence speed but synergistically enhances final-stage optimization with PER-DPP integration. The synthesized method generates navigation paths with optimized length efficiency and directional stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Based Meta Reinforcement Learning for Robust and Adaptable Peg-in-Hole Assembly Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16208v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous assembly is an essential capability for industrial and service robots, with Peg-in-Hole (PiH) insertion being one of the core tasks. However, PiH assembly in unknown environments is still challenging due to uncertainty in task parameters, such as the hole position and orientation, resulting from sensor noise. Although context-based meta reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been previously presented to adapt to unknown task parameters in PiH assembly tasks, the performance depends on a sample-inefficient procedure or human demonstrations. Thus, to enhance the applicability of meta RL in real-world PiH assembly tasks, we propose to train the agent to use information from the robot's forward kinematics and an uncalibrated camera. Furthermore, we improve the performance by efficiently adapting the meta-trained agent to use data from force/torque sensor. Finally, we propose an adaptation procedure for out-of-distribution tasks whose parameters are different from the training tasks. Experiments on simulated and real robots prove that our modifications enhance the sample efficiency during meta training, real-world adaptation performance, and generalization of the context-based meta RL agent in PiH assembly tasks compared to previous approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Safe Robot Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07404v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot foundation models hold the potential for deployment across diverse environments, from industrial applications to household tasks. While current research focuses primarily on the policies' generalization capabilities across a variety of tasks, it fails to address safety, a critical requirement for deployment on real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce a safety layer designed to constrain the action space of any generalist policy appropriately. Our approach uses ATACOM, a safe reinforcement learning algorithm that creates a safe action space and, therefore, ensures safe state transitions. By extending ATACOM to generalist policies, our method facilitates their deployment in safety-critical scenarios without requiring any specific safety fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this safety layer in an air hockey environment, where it prevents a puck-hitting agent from colliding with its surroundings, a failure observed in generalist policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-MARL: A quantum-inspired algorithm using neural message passing for large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07397v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by a graph-based technique for predicting molecular properties in quantum chemistry -- atoms' position within molecules in three-dimensional space -- we present Q-MARL, a completely decentralised learning architecture that supports very large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios without the need for strong assumptions like common rewards or agent order. The key is to treat each agent as relative to its surrounding agents in an environment that is presumed to change dynamically. Hence, in each time step, an agent is the centre of its own neighbourhood and also a neighbour to many other agents. Each role is formulated as a sub-graph, and each sub-graph is used as a training sample. A message-passing neural network supports full-scale vertex and edge interaction within a local neighbourhood, while a parameter governing the depth of the sub-graphs eases the training burden. During testing, an agent's actions are locally ensembled across all the sub-graphs that contain it, resulting in robust decisions. Where other approaches struggle to manage 50 agents, Q-MARL can easily marshal thousands. A detailed theoretical analysis proves improvement and convergence, and simulations with the typical collaborative and competitive scenarios show dramatically faster training speeds and reduced training losses.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttentionSwarm: Reinforcement Learning with Attention Control Barier Function for Crazyflie Drones in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07376v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AttentionSwarm, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate safe and efficient swarm control across three challenging environments: a landing environment with obstacles, a competitive drone game setting, and a dynamic drone racing scenario. Central to our approach is the Attention Model Based Control Barrier Function (CBF) framework, which integrates attention mechanisms with safety-critical control theory to enable real-time collision avoidance and trajectory optimization. This framework dynamically prioritizes critical obstacles and agents in the swarms vicinity using attention weights, while CBFs formally guarantee safety by enforcing collision-free constraints. The safe attention net algorithm was developed and evaluated using a swarm of Crazyflie 2.1 micro quadrotors, which were tested indoors with the Vicon motion capture system to ensure precise localization and control. Experimental results show that our system achieves landing accuracy of 3.02 cm with a mean time of 23 s and collision-free landings in a dynamic landing environment, 100% and collision-free navigation in a drone game environment, and 95% and collision-free navigation for a dynamic multiagent drone racing environment, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. This work offers a promising foundation for applications in dynamic environments where safety and fastness are paramount.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

While rule-based RL has shown remarkable success in improving LLMs' reasoning abilities in text domains, its application to multimodal settings has remained challenging. Our work reproduces key characteristics of text-based RL systems like DeepSeek-R1 in the multimodal space, including steady increases in accuracy reward and response length, and the emergence of reflection behaviors. We demonstrate that both instruction-tuned and pre-trained models can develop strong multimodal reasoning capabilities through rule-based RL without supervised fine-tuning, showing superior data efficiency compared to alternative approaches. We open-source our complete pipeline to foster further research in this area. We release all our codes, models, data, etc. at https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-EUREKA</p></details> |  |
| **[Artificial Utopia: Simulation and Intelligent Agents for a Democratised Future](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07364v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing top-down systems in politics and economics struggle to keep pace with the pressing challenges of the 21st century, such as climate change, social inequality and conflict. Bottom-up democratisation and participatory approaches in politics and economics are increasingly seen as promising alternatives to confront and overcome these issues, often with utopian overtones, as proponents believe they may dramatically reshape political, social and ecological futures for the better and in contrast to contemporary authoritarian tendencies across various countries. Institutional specifics and the associated collective human behavior or culture remains little understood and debated, however. In this article, I propose a novel research agenda focusing on utopian democratisation efforts with formal and computational methods as well as with artificial intelligence - I call this agenda Artificial Utopia. Artificial Utopias provide safe testing grounds for new political ideas and economic policies in-silico with reduced risk of negative consequences as compared to testing ideas in real-world contexts. An increasing number of advanced simulation and intelligence methods, that aim at representing human cognition and collective decision-making in more realistic ways, could benefit this process. This includes agent-based modelling, reinforcement learning, large language models and more. I clarify what some of these simulation approaches can contribute to the study of Artificial Utopias with the help of two institutional examples: the citizen assembly and the democratic firm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Research and Design on Intelligent Recognition of Unordered Targets for Robots Based on Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07340v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of robot target recognition research driven by artificial intelligence (AI), factors such as the disordered distribution of targets, the complexity of the environment, the massive scale of data, and noise interference have significantly restricted the improvement of target recognition accuracy. Against the backdrop of the continuous iteration and upgrading of current AI technologies, to meet the demand for accurate recognition of disordered targets by intelligent robots in complex and changeable scenarios, this study innovatively proposes an AI - based intelligent robot disordered target recognition method using reinforcement learning. This method processes the collected target images with the bilateral filtering algorithm, decomposing them into low - illumination images and reflection images. Subsequently, it adopts differentiated AI strategies, compressing the illumination images and enhancing the reflection images respectively, and then fuses the two parts of images to generate a new image. On this basis, this study deeply integrates deep learning, a core AI technology, with the reinforcement learning algorithm. The enhanced target images are input into a deep reinforcement learning model for training, ultimately enabling the AI - based intelligent robot to efficiently recognize disordered targets. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only significantly improve the quality of target images but also enable the AI - based intelligent robot to complete the recognition task of disordered targets with higher efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating extremely high application value and broad development prospects in the field of AI robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Imitative Reinforcement Learning Framework for Autonomous Dogfight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11562v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) dogfight, which refers to a fight between two or more UCAVs usually at close quarters, plays a decisive role on the aerial battlefields. With the evolution of artificial intelligence, dogfight progressively transits towards intelligent and autonomous modes. However, the development of autonomous dogfight policy learning is hindered by challenges such as weak exploration capabilities, low learning efficiency, and unrealistic simulated environments. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel imitative reinforcement learning framework, which efficiently leverages expert data while enabling autonomous exploration. The proposed framework not only enhances learning efficiency through expert imitation, but also ensures adaptability to dynamic environments via autonomous exploration with reinforcement learning. Therefore, the proposed framework can learn a successful dogfight policy of 'pursuit-lock-launch' for UCAVs. To support data-driven learning, we establish a dogfight environment based on the Harfang3D sandbox, where we conduct extensive experiments. The results indicate that the proposed framework excels in multistage dogfight, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and imitation learning methods. Thanks to the ability of imitating experts and autonomous exploration, our framework can quickly learn the critical knowledge in complex aerial combat tasks, achieving up to a 100% success rate and demonstrating excellent robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Goal Conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Photo Finishing Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07300v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photo finishing tuning aims to automate the manual tuning process of the photo finishing pipeline, like Adobe Lightroom or Darktable. Previous works either use zeroth-order optimization, which is slow when the set of parameters increases, or rely on a differentiable proxy of the target finishing pipeline, which is hard to train. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel goal-conditioned reinforcement learning framework for efficiently tuning parameters using a goal image as a condition. Unlike previous approaches, our tuning framework does not rely on any proxy and treats the photo finishing pipeline as a black box. Utilizing a trained reinforcement learning policy, it can efficiently find the desired set of parameters within just 10 queries, while optimization based approaches normally take 200 queries. Furthermore, our architecture utilizes a goal image to guide the iterative tuning of pipeline parameters, allowing for flexible conditioning on pixel-aligned target images, style images, or any other visually representable goals. We conduct detailed experiments on photo finishing tuning and photo stylization tuning tasks, demonstrating the advantages of our method.

This paper introduces an enhanced, adaptive routing algorithm tailored for AI multi-agent networks, integrating priority-based cost functions and dynamic learning mechanisms. Building on an extended Dijkstra-based framework, we incorporate multi-faceted parameters such as task complexity, user request priority, agent capabilities, bandwidth, latency, load, model sophistication, and reliability. We further propose dynamically adaptive weighting factors, tuned via reinforcement learning (RL), to continuously evolve routing policies based on observed network performance. Additionally, heuristic filtering and hierarchical routing structures improve scalability and responsiveness. Our approach yields context-sensitive, load-aware, and priority-focused routing decisions that not only reduce latency for critical tasks but also optimize overall resource utilization, ultimately enhancing the robustness, flexibility, and efficiency of multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Composing Reinforcement Learning Policies, with Formal Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13785v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework to controller design in environments with a two-level structure: a known high-level graph ("map") in which each vertex is populated by a Markov decision process, called a "room". The framework "separates concerns" by using different design techniques for low- and high-level tasks. We apply reactive synthesis for high-level tasks: given a specification as a logical formula over the high-level graph and a collection of low-level policies obtained together with "concise" latent structures, we construct a "planner" that selects which low-level policy to apply in each room. We develop a reinforcement learning procedure to train low-level policies on latent structures, which unlike previous approaches, circumvents a model distillation step. We pair the policy with probably approximately correct guarantees on its performance and on the abstraction quality, and lift these guarantees to the high-level task. These formal guarantees are the main advantage of the framework. Other advantages include scalability (rooms are large and their dynamics are unknown) and reusability of low-level policies. We demonstrate feasibility in challenging case studies where an agent navigates environments with moving obstacles and visual inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAMAS...</summary><p>AAMAS 2025, 8 pages main text, 19 pages Appendix (excluding references)</p></details> |

These large models, leveraging their extensive training data, provide versatile solutions for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, as modern datasets become increasingly diverse and complex, the development of large AI models faces two major challenges: (1) the enormous consumption of computational resources and deployment difficulties, and (2) the difficulty in fitting heterogeneous and complex data, which limits the usability of the models. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models has recently attracted much attention in addressing these challenges, by dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant sub-models to process input data. It has been shown that MoEs can significantly improve model performance and efficiency with fewer resources, particularly excelling in handling large-scale, multimodal data. Given the tremendous potential MoE has demonstrated across various domains, it is urgent to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advancements of MoEs in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE have their limitations, e.g., being outdated or lacking discussion on certain key areas, and we aim to address these gaps. In this paper, we first introduce the basic design of MoE, including gating functions, expert networks, routing mechanisms, training strategies, and system design. We then explore the algorithm design of MoE in important machine learning paradigms such as continual learning, meta-learning, multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, we summarize theoretical studies aimed at understanding MoE and review its applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions.</p></details> | 28 pages, 3 figures |

However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</p></details> |  |

| **[Boosting the Generalization and Reasoning of Vision Language Models with Curriculum Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07065v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex visual-text tasks, their success heavily relies on massive model scaling, limiting their practical deployment. Small-scale VLMs offer a more practical alternative but face significant challenges when trained with traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), particularly in two aspects: out-of-domain (OOD) generalization and reasoning abilities, which significantly lags behind the contemporary Large language models (LLMs). To address these challenges, we propose Curriculum Reinforcement Finetuning (Curr-ReFT), a novel post-training paradigm specifically designed for small-scale VLMs. Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning in LLMs, Curr-ReFT comprises two sequential stages: (1) Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which ensures steady progression of model capabilities through difficulty-aware reward design, transitioning from basic visual perception to complex reasoning tasks; and (2) Rejected Sampling-based Self-improvement, which maintains the fundamental capabilities of VLMs through selective learning from high-quality multimodal and language examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained with Curr-ReFT paradigm achieve state-of-the-art performance across various visual tasks in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Moreover, our Curr-ReFT enhanced 3B model matches the performance of 32B-parameter models, demonstrating that efficient training paradigms can effectively bridge the gap between small and large models.</p></details> |  |

Currently, most research focuses on proprioception-based methods, which lack the capability to overcome complex terrain. While visual perception is vital for operation in human-centric environments, its integration complicates control further. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have shown promise in enhancing legged robot locomotion, particularly with proprioception-based methods. However, terrain adaptability, especially for bipedal robots, remains a significant challenge, with most research focusing on flat-terrain scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel mixture of experts teacher-student network RL strategy, which enhances the performance of teacher-student policies based on visual inputs through a simple yet effective approach. Our method combines terrain selection strategies with the teacher policy, resulting in superior performance compared to traditional models. Additionally, we introduce an alignment loss between the teacher and student networks, rather than enforcing strict similarity, to improve the student's ability to navigate diverse terrains. We validate our approach experimentally on the Limx Dynamic P1 bipedal robot, demonstrating its feasibility and robustness across multiple terrain types.</p></details> |  |

| **[Using a single actor to output personalized policy for different intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07678v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, with the development of Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) has achieved satisfactory results. In traffic scenarios with multiple intersections, MARL treats each intersection as an agent and optimizes traffic signal control strategies through learning and real-time decision-making. Considering that observation distributions of intersections might be different in real-world scenarios, shared parameter methods might lack diversity and thus lead to high generalization requirements in the shared-policy network. A typical solution is to increase the size of network parameters. However, simply increasing the scale of the network does not necessarily improve policy generalization, which is validated in our experiments. Accordingly, an approach that considers both the personalization of intersections and the efficiency of parameter sharing is required. To this end, we propose Hyper-Action Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization (HAMH-PPO), a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL method that utilizes a shared PPO policy network to deliver personalized policies for intersections with non-iid observation distributions. The centralized critic in HAMH-PPO uses graph attention units to calculate the graph representations of all intersections and outputs a set of value estimates with multiple output heads for each intersection. The decentralized execution actor takes the local observation history as input and output distributions of action as well as a so-called hyper-action to balance the multiple values estimated from the centralized critic to further guide the updating of TSC policies. The combination of hyper-action and multi-head values enables multiple agents to share a single actor-critic while achieving personalized policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Temporal Distances: Contrastive Successor Features Can Provide a Metric Structure for Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17098v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal distances lie at the heart of many algorithms for planning, control, and reinforcement learning that involve reaching goals, allowing one to estimate the transit time between two states. However, prior attempts to define such temporal distances in stochastic settings have been stymied by an important limitation: these prior approaches do not satisfy the triangle inequality. This is not merely a definitional concern, but translates to an inability to generalize and find shortest paths. In this paper, we build on prior work in contrastive learning and quasimetrics to show how successor features learned by contrastive learning (after a change of variables) form a temporal distance that does satisfy the triangle inequality, even in stochastic settings. Importantly, this temporal distance is computationally efficient to estimate, even in high-dimensional and stochastic settings. Experiments in controlled settings and benchmark suites demonstrate that an RL algorithm based on these new temporal distances exhibits combinatorial generalization (i.e., "stitching") and can sometimes learn more quickly than prior methods, including those based on quasimetrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

We leverage RLVR to optimize the Omni model, significantly enhancing its performance in three key aspects: reasoning capability, emotion recognition accuracy, and generalization ability. The introduction of RLVR not only improves the model's overall performance on in-distribution data but also demonstrates superior robustness when evaluated on out-of-distribution datasets. More importantly, the improved reasoning capability enables clear analysis of the contributions of different modalities, particularly visual and audio information, in the emotion recognition process. This provides valuable insights into the optimization of multimodal large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Decision Trees as Amortized Structure Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06985v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building predictive models for tabular data presents fundamental challenges, notably in scaling consistently, i.e., more resources translating to better performance, and generalizing systematically beyond the training data distribution. Designing decision tree models remains especially challenging given the intractably large search space, and most existing methods rely on greedy heuristics, while deep learning inductive biases expect a temporal or spatial structure not naturally present in tabular data. We propose a hybrid amortized structure inference approach to learn predictive decision tree ensembles given data, formulating decision tree construction as a sequential planning problem. We train a deep reinforcement learning (GFlowNet) policy to solve this problem, yielding a generative model that samples decision trees from the Bayesian posterior. We show that our approach, DT-GFN, outperforms state-of-the-art decision tree and deep learning methods on standard classification benchmarks derived from real-world data, robustness to distribution shifts, and anomaly detection, all while yielding interpretable models with shorter description lengths. Samples from the trained DT-GFN model can be ensembled to construct a random forest, and we further show that the performance of scales consistently in ensemble size, yielding ensembles of predictors that continue to generalize systematically.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: $\href{https://github.com/GFNOrg/dt-gfn}{https://github.com/GFNOrg/dt-gfn}$</p></details> |

The algorithm follows the classic Dyna-$Q$ structure, balancing the model-free and model-based approaches, while accelerating the training process of Dyna-$Q$ and mitigating the model discrepancy generated by the model-based feedback. Based on the idea of transfer learning, warm-start information from the demand data of existing similar products can be incorporated into the algorithm to further stabilize the early-stage training and reduce the variance of the estimated optimal policy. Our approach is validated through a case study of bakery inventory management with real data. The adjusted Dyna-$Q$ shows up to a 23.7\% reduction in average daily cost compared with $Q$-learning, and up to a 77.5\% reduction in training time within the same horizon compared with classic Dyna-$Q$. By using transfer learning, it can be found that the adjusted Dyna-$Q$ has the lowest total cost, lowest variance in total cost, and relatively low shortage percentages among all the benchmarking algorithms under a 30-day testing.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Distributionally Robust Statistical Verification with Imprecise Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14815v4)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A particularly challenging problem in AI safety is providing guarantees on the behavior of high-dimensional autonomous systems. Verification approaches centered around reachability analysis fail to scale, and purely statistical approaches are constrained by the distributional assumptions about the sampling process. Instead, we pose a distributionally robust version of the statistical verification problem for black-box systems, where our performance guarantees hold over a large family of distributions. This paper proposes a novel approach based on uncertainty quantification using concepts from imprecise probabilities. A central piece of our approach is an ensemble technique called Imprecise Neural Networks, which provides the uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we solve the allied problem of exploring the input set using active learning. The active learning uses an exhaustive neural-network verification tool Sherlock to collect samples. An evaluation on multiple physical simulators in the openAI gym Mujoco environments with reinforcement-learned controllers demonstrates that our approach can provide useful and scalable guarantees for high-dimensional systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Regularization on Globally Accessible States in Cross-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06893v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To learn from data collected in diverse dynamics, Imitation from Observation (IfO) methods leverage expert state trajectories based on the premise that recovering expert state distributions in other dynamics facilitates policy learning in the current one. However, Imitation Learning inherently imposes a performance upper bound of learned policies. Additionally, as the environment dynamics change, certain expert states may become inaccessible, rendering their distributions less valuable for imitation. To address this, we propose a novel framework that integrates reward maximization with IfO, employing F-distance regularized policy optimization. This framework enforces constraints on globally accessible states--those with nonzero visitation frequency across all considered dynamics--mitigating the challenge posed by inaccessible states. By instantiating F-distance in different ways, we derive two theoretical analysis and develop a practical algorithm called Accessible State Oriented Policy Regularization (ASOR). ASOR serves as a general add-on module that can be incorporated into various RL approaches, including offline RL and off-policy RL. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate ASOR's effectiveness in enhancing state-of-the-art cross-domain policy transfer algorithms, significantly improving their performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Mastering Continual Reinforcement Learning through Fine-Grained Sparse Network Allocation and Dormant Neuron Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05246v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is essential for developing agents that can learn, adapt, and accumulate knowledge over time. However, a fundamental challenge persists as agents must strike a delicate balance between plasticity, which enables rapid skill acquisition, and stability, which ensures long-term knowledge retention while preventing catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we introduce SSDE, a novel structure-based approach that enhances plasticity through a fine-grained allocation strategy with Structured Sparsity and Dormant-guided Exploration. SSDE decomposes the parameter space into forward-transfer (frozen) parameters and task-specific (trainable) parameters. Crucially, these parameters are allocated by an efficient co-allocation scheme under sparse coding, ensuring sufficient trainable capacity for new tasks while promoting efficient forward transfer through frozen parameters. However, structure-based methods often suffer from rigidity due to the accumulation of non-trainable parameters, limiting exploration and adaptability. To address this, we further introduce a sensitivity-guided neuron reactivation mechanism that systematically identifies and resets dormant neurons, which exhibit minimal influence in the sparse policy network during inference. This approach effectively enhance exploration while preserving structural efficiency. Extensive experiments on the CW10-v1 Continual World benchmark demonstrate that SSDE achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching a success rate of 95%, surpassing prior methods significantly in both plasticity and stability trade-offs (code is available at: https://github.com/chengqiArchy/SSDE).</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Based Symbolic Regression for Load Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06879v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, growing demand variability, and evolving grid control strategies, accurate and efficient load modeling has become a critical yet challenging task. Traditional methods, such as fixed-form parametric models and data-driven approaches, often struggle to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel symbolic regression algorithm based on the Actor-Critic reinforcement learning framework, specifically tailored for dynamic load modeling. The algorithm employs a trainable expression tree with controlled depth and a predefined set of operators to generate compact and interpretable mathematical expressions. The Actor network probabilistically selects operators for the symbolic expression, while the Critic evaluates the resulting expression tree through a loss function. To further enhance performance, a candidate pool mechanism is implemented to store high-performing expressions, which are subsequently fine-tuned using gradient descent. By focusing on simplicity and precision, the proposed method significantly reduces computational complexity while preserving interpretability. Experimental results validate its superior performance compared to existing benchmarks, which offers a robust and scalable solution for dynamic load modeling and system analysis in modern power systems.</p></details> | 9pages |

| **[Generating Robot Constitutions & Benchmarks for Semantic Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08663v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Until recently, robotics safety research was predominantly about collision avoidance and hazard reduction in the immediate vicinity of a robot. Since the advent of large vision and language models (VLMs), robots are now also capable of higher-level semantic scene understanding and natural language interactions with humans. Despite their known vulnerabilities (e.g. hallucinations or jail-breaking), VLMs are being handed control of robots capable of physical contact with the real world. This can lead to dangerous behaviors, making semantic safety for robots a matter of immediate concern. Our contributions in this paper are two fold: first, to address these emerging risks, we release the ASIMOV Benchmark, a large-scale and comprehensive collection of datasets for evaluating and improving semantic safety of foundation models serving as robot brains. Our data generation recipe is highly scalable: by leveraging text and image generation techniques, we generate undesirable situations from real-world visual scenes and human injury reports from hospitals. Secondly, we develop a framework to automatically generate robot constitutions from real-world data to steer a robot's behavior using Constitutional AI mechanisms. We propose a novel auto-amending process that is able to introduce nuances in written rules of behavior; this can lead to increased alignment with human preferences on behavior desirability and safety. We explore trade-offs between generality and specificity across a diverse set of constitutions of different lengths, and demonstrate that a robot is able to effectively reject unconstitutional actions. We measure a top alignment rate of 84.3% on the ASIMOV Benchmark using generated constitutions, outperforming no-constitution baselines and human-written constitutions.

Inspired by robotic learning via guided human expert demonstration, we here propose a novel cross-embodiment robotic manipulation algorithm via CycleVAE and human behavior transformer. First, we utilize unsupervised CycleVAE together with a bidirectional subspace alignment algorithm to align latent motion sequences between cross-embodiments. Second, we propose a casual human behavior transformer design to learn the intrinsic motion dynamics of human expert demonstrations. During the test case, we leverage the proposed transformer for the human expert demonstration generation, which will be aligned using CycleVAE for the final human-robotic manipulation synthesis. We validated our proposed algorithm through extensive experiments using a dexterous robotic manipulator with the robotic hand. Our results successfully generate smooth trajectories across intricate tasks, outperforming prior learning-based robotic motion planning algorithms. These results have implications for performing unsupervised cross-embodiment alignment and future autonomous robotics design.

| **[Hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning for Radio Tracer Localisation in Robotic-assisted Radioguided Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08492v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radioguided surgery, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy, relies on the precise localization of radioactive targets by non-imaging gamma/beta detectors. Manual radioactive target detection based on visual display or audible indication of gamma level is highly dependent on the ability of the surgeon to track and interpret the spatial information. This paper presents a learning-based method to realize the autonomous radiotracer detection in robot-assisted surgeries by navigating the probe to the radioactive target. We proposed novel hybrid approach that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with adaptive robotic scanning. The adaptive grid-based scanning could provide initial direction estimation while the DRL-based agent could efficiently navigate to the target utilising historical data. Simulation experiments demonstrate a 95% success rate, and improved efficiency and robustness compared to conventional techniques. Real-world evaluation on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) further confirms the feasibility of the approach, achieving an 80% success rate in radiotracer detection. This method has the potential to enhance consistency, reduce operator dependency, and improve procedural accuracy in radioguided surgeries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |
| **[PhysVLM: Enabling Visual Language Models to Understand Robotic Physical Reachability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08481v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the environment and a robot's physical reachability is crucial for task execution. While state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) excel in environmental perception, they often generate inaccurate or impractical responses in embodied visual reasoning tasks due to a lack of understanding of robotic physical reachability. To address this issue, we propose a unified representation of physical reachability across diverse robots, i.e., Space-Physical Reachability Map (S-P Map), and PhysVLM, a vision-language model that integrates this reachability information into visual reasoning. Specifically, the S-P Map abstracts a robot's physical reachability into a generalized spatial representation, independent of specific robot configurations, allowing the model to focus on reachability features rather than robot-specific parameters. Subsequently, PhysVLM extends traditional VLM architectures by incorporating an additional feature encoder to process the S-P Map, enabling the model to reason about physical reachability without compromising its general vision-language capabilities. To train and evaluate PhysVLM, we constructed a large-scale multi-robot dataset, Phys100K, and a challenging benchmark, EQA-phys, which includes tasks for six different robots in both simulated and real-world environments. Experimental results demonstrate that PhysVLM outperforms existing models, achieving a 14\% improvement over GPT-4o on EQA-phys and surpassing advanced embodied VLMs such as RoboMamba and SpatialVLM on the RoboVQA-val and OpenEQA benchmarks. Additionally, the S-P Map shows strong compatibility with various VLMs, and its integration into GPT-4o-mini yields a 7.1\% performance improvement.</p></details> |  |

While point-wise assessment has many potential applications, incorporating automated large-area scanning would enable holistic tissue sampling with higher consistency. We propose a robotic system to facilitate autonomous DRS scanning with hybrid visual servoing control. A specially designed height compensation module enables precise contact condition control. The evaluation results show that the system can accurately execute the scanning command and acquire consistent DRS spectra with comparable results to the manual collection, which is the current gold standard protocol. Integrating the proposed system into surgery lays the groundwork for autonomous intra-operative DRS tissue assessment with high reliability and repeatability. This could reduce the need for manual scanning by the surgeon while ensuring complete tumor removal in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

However, the computational constraints of real-time learning on robots pose a significant challenge. We present a framework for efficiently learning quadruped locomotion in just 8 minutes of raw real-time training utilizing the sample efficiency and minimal computational overhead of the new off-policy algorithm CrossQ. We investigate two control architectures: Predicting joint target positions for agile, high-speed locomotion and Central Pattern Generators for stable, natural gaits. While prior work focused on learning simple forward gaits, our framework extends on-robot learning to omnidirectional locomotion. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach in different indoor and outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiPS: Large-Scale Humanoid Robot Reinforcement Learning with Parallel-Series Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08349v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, research on humanoid robots has garnered significant attention, particularly in reinforcement learning based control algorithms, which have achieved major breakthroughs. Compared to traditional model-based control algorithms, reinforcement learning based algorithms demonstrate substantial advantages in handling complex tasks. Leveraging the large-scale parallel computing capabilities of GPUs, contemporary humanoid robots can undergo extensive parallel training in simulated environments. A physical simulation platform capable of large-scale parallel training is crucial for the development of humanoid robots. As one of the most complex robot forms, humanoid robots typically possess intricate mechanical structures, encompassing numerous series and parallel mechanisms. However, many reinforcement learning based humanoid robot control algorithms currently employ open-loop topologies during training, deferring the conversion to series-parallel structures until the sim2real phase. This approach is primarily due to the limitations of physics engines, as current GPU-based physics engines often only support open-loop topologies or have limited capabilities in simulating multi-rigid-body closed-loop topologies. For enabling reinforcement learning-based humanoid robot control algorithms to train in large-scale parallel environments, we propose a novel training method LiPS. By incorporating multi-rigid-body dynamics modeling in the simulation environment, we significantly reduce the sim2real gap and the difficulty of converting to parallel structures during model deployment, thereby robustly supporting large-scale reinforcement learning for humanoid robots.</p></details> |  |

With breakthroughs in various types of artificial intelligence algorithms, embodied intelligence, exemplified by humanoid robots, has been highly anticipated. The advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have significantly improved the motion control and generalization capabilities of humanoid robots. Simultaneously, the groundbreaking progress in large language models (LLM) and visual language models (VLM) has brought more possibilities and imagination to humanoid robots. LLM enables humanoid robots to understand complex tasks from language instructions and perform long-term task planning, while VLM greatly enhances the robots' understanding and interaction with their environment. This paper introduces \textcolor{magenta}{Trinity}, a novel AI system for humanoid robots that integrates RL, LLM, and VLM. By combining these technologies, Trinity enables efficient control of humanoid robots in complex environments.

| **[Dynamic Risk Assessment for Human-Robot Collaboration Using a Heuristics-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08316v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-robot collaboration (HRC) introduces significant safety challenges, particularly in protecting human operators working alongside collaborative robots (cobots). While current ISO standards emphasize risk assessment and hazard identification, these procedures are often insufficient for addressing the complexity of HRC environments, which involve numerous design factors and dynamic interactions. This publication presents a method for objective hazard analysis to support Dynamic Risk Assessment, extending beyond reliance on expert knowledge. The approach monitors scene parameters, such as the distance between human body parts and the cobot, as well as the cobot`s Cartesian velocity. Additionally, an anthropocentric parameter focusing on the orientation of the human head within the collaborative workspace is introduced. These parameters are transformed into hazard indicators using non-linear heuristic functions. The hazard indicators are then aggregated to estimate the total hazard level of a given scenario. The proposed method is evaluated using an industrial dataset that depicts various interactions between a human operator and a cobot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distillation-PPO: A Novel Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning Framework for Humanoid Robot Perceptive Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08299v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, humanoid robots have garnered significant attention from both academia and industry due to their high adaptability to environments and human-like characteristics. With the rapid advancement of reinforcement learning, substantial progress has been made in the walking control of humanoid robots. However, existing methods still face challenges when dealing with complex environments and irregular terrains. In the field of perceptive locomotion, existing approaches are generally divided into two-stage methods and end-to-end methods. Two-stage methods first train a teacher policy in a simulated environment and then use distillation techniques, such as DAgger, to transfer the privileged information learned as latent features or actions to the student policy. End-to-end methods, on the other hand, forgo the learning of privileged information and directly learn policies from a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) through reinforcement learning. However, due to the lack of supervision from a teacher policy, end-to-end methods often face difficulties in training and exhibit unstable performance in real-world applications. This paper proposes an innovative two-stage perceptive locomotion framework that combines the advantages of teacher policies learned in a fully observable Markov decision process (MDP) to regularize and supervise the student policy. At the same time, it leverages the characteristics of reinforcement learning to ensure that the student policy can continue to learn in a POMDP, thereby enhancing the model's upper bound. Our experimental results demonstrate that our two-stage training framework achieves higher training efficiency and stability in simulated environments, while also exhibiting better robustness and generalization capabilities in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

As global environmental challenges intensify, robotics offers a powerful solution to reduce chemical usage while meeting the increasing demands for food production. However, significant challenges remain in ensuring the autonomy and resilience of robots operating in unstructured agricultural environments. Obstacles such as crops and tall grass, which are deformable, must be identified as safely traversable, compared to rigid obstacles. To address this, we propose a new traversability analysis method based on a 3D spectral map reconstructed using a LIDAR and a multispectral camera. This approach enables the robot to distinguish between safe and unsafe collisions with deformable obstacles. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of multispectral metrics for vegetation detection and incorporate these metrics into an augmented environmental map. Utilizing this map, we compute a physics-based traversability metric that accounts for the robot's weight and size, ensuring safe navigation over deformable obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA25)</p></details> |

However, previous studies have primarily focused on detecting and analyzing objects or robots, with limited attention to ensuring safety, which is critical for clinical applications, where accidents can be caused by unsafe robot motions. In this study, we propose a new control framework that can formally ensure the safety of automating certain processes involved in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), a representative endoscopic surgical method for the treatment of early GI cancer, by using an endoscopic robot. The proposed framework utilizes Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to accurately identify the boundaries of individual tumors, even in close proximity within the GI tract, ensuring precise treatment and removal while preserving the surrounding normal tissue. Additionally, by adopting a model-free control scheme, safety assurance is made possible even in endoscopic robotic systems where dynamic modeling is challenging. We demonstrate the proposed framework in cases where the tumors to be removed are close to each other, showing that the safety constraints are enforced. We show that the model-free CBF-based controlled robot eliminates one tumor completely without damaging it, while not invading another nearby tumor.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to IEEE Access</p></details> |

Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks. To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interaction-Aware Multi-Robot Kinodynamic Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16445v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kinodynamic motion planning for a multi-robot system with different dynamics and actuation limits is a challenging problem. The difficulty increases with the presence of an aerodynamic interaction force that occur in aerial robots flying in close-proximity. Due to these complexities, existing planners either rely on simplified assumption like ignoring robot dynamics, interaction forces or produce highly suboptimal solutions. This paper presents a kinodynamic motion planner for a heterogeneous team of robots that respects robot dynamics and directly reasons about interaction forces between aerial robots operating in close-proximity. Our method, db-ECBS, generalizes the multi-agent path finding method Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS) to the continuous domain by using the single-robot kinodynamic motion planner discontinuity-bounded A*. Db-ECBS operates on three levels. Initially, individual robot trajectories are computed using a graph search that allows bounded discontinuities between precomputed motion primitives. The second level identifies inter-robot collisions, interaction force violations and resolves them by imposing constraints on the first level. The third and final level uses the resulting solution with discontinuities as an initial guess for a joint space trajectory optimization. The procedure is repeated with a reduced discontinuity bound resulting in a anytime, probabilistically complete, and asymptotically bounded suboptimal planner. We provide a benchmark of 65 problems with six different dynamics. We demonstrate that db-ECBS produces trajectories that are less than half the cost of existing planners. We show that the interaction-awareness is in particular important for very dense scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is currently under review</p></details> |

FIRs, because of their small weight and size, offer unparalleled advantages in terms of material cost and scalability. However, their size introduces considerable control challenges, notably high-speed dynamics, restricted power, and limited payload capacity. While there have been advancements in developing lightweight sensors, often drawing inspiration from biological systems, no sub-gram aircraft has been able to attain sustained hover without relying on feedback from external sensing such as a motion capture system. The lightest vehicle capable of sustained hovering -- the first level of ``sensor autonomy'' -- is the much larger 28 g Crazyflie. Previous work reported a reduction in size of that vehicle's avionics suite to 187 mg and 21 mW. Here, we report a further reduction in mass and power to only 78.4 mg and 15 mW. We replaced the laser rangefinder with a lighter and more efficient pressure sensor, and built a smaller optic flow sensor around a global-shutter imaging chip.

| **[Adaptive Task Allocation in Multi-Human Multi-Robot Teams under Team Heterogeneity and Dynamic Information Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13824v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task allocation in multi-human multi-robot (MH-MR) teams presents significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of team members, the dynamics of task execution, and the information uncertainty of operational states. Existing approaches often fail to address these challenges simultaneously, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle this, we propose ATA-HRL, an adaptive task allocation framework using hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), which incorporates initial task allocation (ITA) that leverages team heterogeneity and conditional task reallocation in response to dynamic operational states. Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary state representation learning task to manage information uncertainty and enhance task execution. Through an extensive case study in large-scale environmental monitoring tasks, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

However, existing practices often require training a personalized robot policy from scratch, resulting in inefficient use of human feedback. In this paper, we propose preference-based action representation learning (PbARL), an efficient fine-tuning method that decouples common task structure from preference by leveraging pre-trained robot policies. Instead of directly fine-tuning the pre-trained policy with human preference, PbARL uses it as a reference for an action representation learning task that maximizes the mutual information between the pre-trained source domain and the target user preference-aligned domain. This approach allows the robot to personalize its behaviors while preserving original task performance and eliminates the need for extensive prior information from the source domain, thereby enhancing efficiency and practicality in real-world HRI scenarios. Empirical results on the Assistive Gym benchmark and a real-world user study (N=8) demonstrate the benefits of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

We develop a modular approach, where a large language model (LLM) translates the natural language instructions into a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula with propositions defined by object classes in a semantic occupancy map. The LTL formula and the semantic occupancy map are provided to a motion planning algorithm to generate a collision-free robot path that satisfies the natural language instructions. Our main contribution is LTLCodeGen, a method to translate natural language to syntactically correct LTL using code generation. We demonstrate the complete task planning method in real-world experiments involving human speech to provide navigation instructions to a mobile robot. We also thoroughly evaluate our approach in simulated and real-world experiments in comparison to end-to-end LLM task planning and state-of-the-art LLM-to-LTL translation methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes an innovative framework that integrates advanced visual perception technologies, real-time ergonomic monitoring, and Behaviour Tree (BT)-based adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional methods, which often operate in isolation or statically, our approach combines deep learning models (YOLO11 and SlowOnly), advanced tracking (Unscented Kalman Filter) and dynamic ergonomic assessments (OWAS), offering a modular, scalable and adaptive system. Experimental results show that the framework outperforms previous methods in several aspects: accuracy in detecting postures and actions, adaptivity in managing human-robot interactions, and ability to reduce ergonomic risk through timely robotic interventions. In particular, the visual perception module showed superiority over YOLOv9 and YOLOv8, while real-time ergonomic monitoring eliminated the limitations of static analysis. Adaptive role management, made possible by the Behaviour Tree, provided greater responsiveness than rule-based systems, making the framework suitable for complex industrial scenarios. Our system demonstrated a 92.5\% accuracy in grasping intention recognition and successfully classified ergonomic risks with real-time responsiveness (average latency of 0.57 seconds), enabling timely robotic</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pagine, 10 figure, 3 tabelle, formato conferenza IEEE</p></details> |
| **[Safety Guardrails for LLM-Enabled Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07885v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked transformative capabilities, it has also introduced significant safety concerns, ranging from average-case LLM errors (e.g., hallucinations) to adversarial jailbreaking attacks, which can produce harmful robot behavior in real-world settings. Traditional robot safety approaches do not address the novel vulnerabilities of LLMs, and current LLM safety guardrails overlook the physical risks posed by robots operating in dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose RoboGuard, a two-stage guardrail architecture to ensure the safety of LLM-enabled robots. RoboGuard first contextualizes pre-defined safety rules by grounding them in the robot's environment using a root-of-trust LLM, which employs chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to generate rigorous safety specifications, such as temporal logic constraints. RoboGuard then resolves potential conflicts between these contextual safety specifications and a possibly unsafe plan using temporal logic control synthesis, which ensures safety compliance while minimally violating user preferences. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments that consider worst-case jailbreaking attacks, we demonstrate that RoboGuard reduces the execution of unsafe plans from 92% to below 2.5% without compromising performance on safe plans. We also demonstrate that RoboGuard is resource-efficient, robust against adaptive attacks, and significantly enhanced by enabling its root-of-trust LLM to perform CoT reasoning. These results underscore the potential of RoboGuard to mitigate the safety risks and enhance the reliability of LLM-enabled robots.</p></details> |  |

This usually involves changing the belief about the scene or physically interacting and changing the scene (e.g. sort the objects from lightest to heaviest). In order to facilitate the development of such systems we introduce a new modular Closed Loop Interactive Embodied Reasoning (CLIER) approach that takes into account the measurements of non-visual object properties, changes in the scene caused by external disturbances as well as uncertain outcomes of robotic actions. CLIER performs multi-modal reasoning and action planning and generates a sequence of primitive actions that can be executed by a robot manipulator. Our method operates in a closed loop, responding to changes in the environment. Our approach is developed with the use of MuBle simulation environment and tested in 10 interactive benchmark scenarios. We extensively evaluate our reasoning approach in simulation and in real-world manipulation tasks with a success rate above 76% and 64%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025.

In collaboration with the LEGO Group, we developed Robert Robot, a simplified robot, which enables socialization between children and facilitates shared experiences when meeting for the first time. An exploratory study to observe socialization between preschool children was conducted with 30 respondents in pairs. Additionally, observational data from 212 play sessions with four Robert Robots in the wild were collected. Subsequent analysis found that children have fun as Robert Robot breaks the ice between unfamiliar children. The children relayed audio cues related to the imaginative world of Robert Robot's personalities and mimicked each other as a method of initiating social play and communication with their unfamiliar peers. Furthermore, the study contributes four implications for the design of robots for socialization between children. This chapter provides an example case of serious storytelling using playful interactions engaging children with the character of the robot and the mini-narratives around the build requests.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, accepted for inclusion in forthcoming book</p></details> |

However, existing approaches heavily focus on learning from passive human demonstration data for its simplicity in data collection. Interactive human teaching has appealing theoretical and practical properties, but they are not well supported by existing human-robot interfaces. This paper proposes a novel system that enables seamless control switching between human and an autonomous policy for bi-manual manipulation tasks, enabling more efficient learning of new tasks. This is achieved through a compliant, bilateral teleoperation system. Through simulation and hardware experiments, we demonstrate the value of our system in an interactive human teaching for learning complex bi-manual manipulation skills.</p></details> |  |

We consider a swarm of $n\in\mathbb{N}$ robots in the $\mathcal{OBLOT}$ model and analyze their collective $\mathcal{F}$sync dynamics using of equivariant dynamical systems theory. To this end, we show that the corresponding evolution function commutes with rotational and reflective transformations of $\mathbb{R}^2$. These form a group that is isomorphic to $\mathbf{O}(2) \times S_n$, the product group of the orthogonal group and the permutation on $n$ elements. The theory of equivariant dynamical systems is used to deduce a hierarchy along which symmetries of a robot swarm can potentially increase following an arbitrary protocol. By decoupling the Look phase from the Compute and Move phases in the mathematical description of an LCM cycle, this hierarchy can be characterized in terms of automorphisms of connectivity graphs. In particular, we find all possible types of symmetry increase, if the decoupled Compute and Move phase is invertible. Finally, we apply our results to protocols which induce state-dependent linear dynamics, where the reduced system consisting of only the Compute and Move phase is linear.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 Figures |

The accuracy of these representations depends on each agent's ability to perform theory of mind, i.e. to understand the knowledge, preferences, and intentions of their teammate. When mental models diverge to the extent that it affects task execution, reconciliation becomes necessary to prevent the degradation of interaction. We propose a framework for bi-directional mental model reconciliation, leveraging large language models to facilitate alignment through semi-structured natural language dialogue. Our framework relaxes the assumption of prior model reconciliation work that either the human or robot agent begins with a correct model for the other agent to align to. Through our framework, both humans and robots are able to identify and communicate missing task-relevant context during interaction, iteratively progressing toward a shared mental model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Advan...</summary><p>Advancing Artificial Intelligence through Theory of Mind Workshop at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, these policies have been shown to loss of plasticity when extended to long-term learning in non-stationary environments. For example, the standard proximal policy optimization (PPO) policy is observed to collapse in long-term training settings and lead to significant control performance degradation. To address this problem, this work proposes a cost-aware framework that uses a retrospective cost mechanism (RECOM) to balance rewards and losses in RL training with a non-stationary environment. Using a cost gradient relation between rewards and losses, our framework dynamically updates the learning rate to actively train the control policy in a disturbed wind environment. Our experimental results show that our framework learned a policy for the hovering task without policy collapse in variable wind conditions and has a successful result of 11.29% less dormant units than L2 regularization with PPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demonstration-Enhanced Adaptive Multi-Objective Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04857v4)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-aligned robot navigation in human environments is typically achieved through learning-based approaches, utilizing user feedback or demonstrations for personalization. However, personal preferences are subject to change and might even be context-dependent. Yet traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches with static reward functions often fall short in adapting to varying user preferences, inevitably reflecting demonstrations once training is completed. This paper introduces a structured framework that combines demonstration-based learning with multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL). To ensure real-world applicability, our approach allows for dynamic adaptation of the robot navigation policy to changing user preferences without retraining. It fluently modulates the amount of demonstration data reflection and other preference-related objectives. Through rigorous evaluations, including a baseline comparison and sim-to-real transfer on two robots, we demonstrate our framework's capability to adapt to user preferences accurately while achieving high navigational performance in terms of collision avoidance and goal pursuance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Key Frame Based (KFB) routines, either require extensive fine-tuning or lack real-time adaptability. This paper introduces FRASA, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent that integrates fall recovery and stand up strategies into a unified framework. Leveraging the Cross-Q algorithm, FRASA significantly reduces training time and offers a versatile recovery strategy that adapts to unpredictable disturbances. Comparative tests on Sigmaban humanoid robots demonstrate FRASA superior performance against the KFB method deployed in the RoboCup 2023 by the Rhoban Team, world champion of the KidSize League.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a hybrid control scheme that combines the advantages of active and passive interaction control. To accomplish this, we propose the design of a novel Active Remote Center of Compliance (ARCC), which is based on a passive and active element which can be used to directly control the interaction forces. We introduce surrogate models for a dynamic comparison against purely robot-based interaction schemes. In a comparative validation, ARCC drastically improves the interaction dynamics, leading to an increase in the motion bandwidth of up to 31 times. We introduce further our control approach as well as the integration in the robot controller. Finally, we analyze ARCC on different industrial benchmarks like peg-in-hole, top-hat rail assembly and contour following problems and compare it against the state of the art, to highlight the dynamic and flexibility. The proposed system is especially suited if the application requires a low cycle time combined with a sensitive manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>\copy...</summary><p>\copyright 2025 IEEE.

AI-based approaches appear to be up to the challenge, but in production they must not only achieve high success rates. They must also ensure insertion quality and reliability. To address this, we introduce QBIT, a quality-aware benchmarking framework that incorporates additional metrics such as force energy, force smoothness and completion time to provide a comprehensive assessment. To ensure statistical significance and minimize the sim-to-real gap, we randomize contact parameters in the MuJoCo simulator, account for perceptual uncertainty, and conduct large-scale experiments on a Kubernetes-based infrastructure. Our microservice-oriented architecture ensures extensibility, broad applicability, and improved reproducibility. To facilitate seamless transitions to physical robotic testing, we use ROS2 with containerization to reduce integration barriers. We evaluate QBIT using three insertion approaches: geometricbased, force-based, and learning-based, in both simulated and real-world environments. In simulation, we compare the accuracy of contact simulation using different mesh decomposition techniques. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of QBIT in comparing different insertion approaches and accelerating the transition from laboratory to real-world applications.

A wheeled-grasping hybrid robot with modular, tendon-driven grasping arms and a wheeled drive system mounted on a turret was developed to climb columns of varying diameters. Here, the key innovation is the underactuated arms that can be adjusted to different column sizes by adding or removing modular linkages, though the robot also features capabilities like self-locking (the ability of the robot to stay on the column by friction without power), autonomous grasping, and rotation around the column axis. Mathematical models describe conditions for self-locking and vertical climbing. Experimental results demonstrate the robot's efficacy in climbing and self-locking, validating the proposed models and highlighting the potential for fully automated solutions in industrial applications.

While current research focuses primarily on the policies' generalization capabilities across a variety of tasks, it fails to address safety, a critical requirement for deployment on real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce a safety layer designed to constrain the action space of any generalist policy appropriately. Our approach uses ATACOM, a safe reinforcement learning algorithm that creates a safe action space and, therefore, ensures safe state transitions. By extending ATACOM to generalist policies, our method facilitates their deployment in safety-critical scenarios without requiring any specific safety fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this safety layer in an air hockey environment, where it prevents a puck-hitting agent from colliding with its surroundings, a failure observed in generalist policies.</p></details> |  |

Against the backdrop of the continuous iteration and upgrading of current AI technologies, to meet the demand for accurate recognition of disordered targets by intelligent robots in complex and changeable scenarios, this study innovatively proposes an AI - based intelligent robot disordered target recognition method using reinforcement learning. This method processes the collected target images with the bilateral filtering algorithm, decomposing them into low - illumination images and reflection images. Subsequently, it adopts differentiated AI strategies, compressing the illumination images and enhancing the reflection images respectively, and then fuses the two parts of images to generate a new image. On this basis, this study deeply integrates deep learning, a core AI technology, with the reinforcement learning algorithm. The enhanced target images are input into a deep reinforcement learning model for training, ultimately enabling the AI - based intelligent robot to efficiently recognize disordered targets. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only significantly improve the quality of target images but also enable the AI - based intelligent robot to complete the recognition task of disordered targets with higher efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating extremely high application value and broad development prospects in the field of AI robots.</p></details> |  |

We present a data-efficient calibration method that enables rapid, full-array force estimation across varying geometries, providing online feedback that accounts for non-linearities and deformation effects. Our force estimation model serves as feedback in an online closed-loop control system for interaction force tracking. The accuracy of our estimates is independently validated against measurements from a calibrated force-torque sensor.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of multi-robot cooperative exploration systems. First, we review the evolution of robotic exploration and introduce a modular research framework tailored for multi-robot cooperative exploration. Based on this framework, we systematically categorize and summarize key system components. As a foundational module for multi-robot exploration, the localization and mapping module is primarily introduced by focusing on global and relative pose estimation, as well as multi-robot map merging techniques. The cooperative motion module is further divided into learning-based approaches and multi-stage planning, with the latter encompassing target generation, task allocation, and motion planning strategies. Given the communication constraints of real-world environments, we also analyze the communication module, emphasizing how robots exchange information within local communication ranges and under limited transmission capabilities. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future research directions for multi-robot cooperative exploration in light of real-world trends. This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the field.</p></details> |  |

Effective coordination is essential to prevent inefficiencies and risks for human operators working alongside robots. This paper proposes a human-aware task allocation and scheduling model based on Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming to optimize efficiency and safety starting from task planning stages. The approach exploits synergies that encode the coupling effects between pairs of tasks executed in parallel by the agents, arising from the safety constraints imposed on robot agents. These terms are learned from previous executions using a Bayesian estimation; the inference of the posterior probability distribution of the synergy coefficients is performed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The synergy enhances task planning by adapting the nominal duration of the plan according to the effect of the operator's presence. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method produces improved human-aware task plans, reducing unuseful interference between agents, increasing human-robot distance, and achieving up to an 18\% reduction in process execution time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (2025)</p></details> |

The big question remains, how can we bridge the embodiment gap while minimizing physical robot learning, which fundamentally does not scale well. We argue that learning from in-the-wild human videos offers a promising solution for robotic manipulation tasks, as vast amounts of relevant data already exist on the internet. In this work, we present VidBot, a framework enabling zero-shot robotic manipulation using learned 3D affordance from in-the-wild monocular RGB-only human videos. VidBot leverages a pipeline to extract explicit representations from them, namely 3D hand trajectories from videos, combining a depth foundation model with structure-from-motion techniques to reconstruct temporally consistent, metric-scale 3D affordance representations agnostic to embodiments. We introduce a coarse-to-fine affordance learning model that first identifies coarse actions from the pixel space and then generates fine-grained interaction trajectories with a diffusion model, conditioned on coarse actions and guided by test-time constraints for context-aware interaction planning, enabling substantial generalization to novel scenes and embodiments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of VidBot, which significantly outperforms counterparts across 13 manipulation tasks in zero-shot settings and can be seamlessly deployed across robot systems in real-world environments. VidBot paves the way for leveraging everyday human videos to make robot learning more scalable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Current world models typically cannot directly and explicitly imitate the actual environment in front of a robot, often resulting in unrealistic behaviors and hallucinations that make them unsuitable for real-world robotics applications. To overcome those challenges, we propose to rethink robot world models as learnable digital twins. We introduce DreMa, a new approach for constructing digital twins automatically using learned explicit representations of the real world and its dynamics, bridging the gap between traditional digital twins and world models. DreMa replicates the observed world and its structure by integrating Gaussian Splatting and physics simulators, allowing robots to imagine novel configurations of objects and to predict the future consequences of robot actions thanks to its compositionality. We leverage this capability to generate new data for imitation learning by applying equivariant transformations to a small set of demonstrations. Our evaluations across various settings demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and robustness by incrementing actions and object distributions, reducing the data needed to learn a policy and improving the generalization of the agents. As a highlight, we show that a real Franka Emika Panda robot, powered by DreMa's imagination, can successfully learn novel physical tasks from just a single example per task variation (one-shot policy learning).

| **[iManip: Skill-Incremental Learning for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07087v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of a generalist agent with adaptive multiple manipulation skills has been a long-standing goal in the robotics community. In this paper, we explore a crucial task, skill-incremental learning, in robotic manipulation, which is to endow the robots with the ability to learn new manipulation skills based on the previous learned knowledge without re-training. First, we build a skill-incremental environment based on the RLBench benchmark, and explore how traditional incremental methods perform in this setting. We find that they suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting due to the previous methods on classification overlooking the characteristics of temporality and action complexity in robotic manipulation tasks. Towards this end, we propose an incremental Manip}ulation framework, termed iManip, to mitigate the above issues. We firstly design a temporal replay strategy to maintain the integrity of old skills when learning new skill. Moreover, we propose the extendable PerceiverIO, consisting of an action prompt with extendable weight to adapt to new action primitives in new skill. Extensive experiments show that our framework performs well in Skill-Incremental Learning. Codes of the skill-incremental environment with our framework will be open-source.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboReflect: A Robotic Reflective Reasoning Framework for Grasping Ambiguous-Condition Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09307v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robotic technology rapidly develops, robots are being employed in an increasing number of fields. However, due to the complexity of deployment environments or the prevalence of ambiguous-condition objects, the practical application of robotics still faces many challenges, leading to frequent errors. Traditional methods and some LLM-based approaches, although improved, still require substantial human intervention and struggle with autonomous error correction in complex scenarios. In this work, we propose RoboReflect, a novel framework leveraging large vision-language models (LVLMs) to enable self-reflection and autonomous error correction in robotic grasping tasks. RoboReflect allows robots to automatically adjust their strategies based on unsuccessful attempts until successful execution is achieved. The corrected strategies are saved in the memory for future task reference. We evaluate RoboReflect through extensive testing on eight common objects prone to ambiguous conditions of three categories. Our results demonstrate that RoboReflect not only outperforms existing grasp pose estimation methods like AnyGrasp and high-level action planning techniques ReKep with GPT-4V but also significantly enhances the robot's capability to adapt and correct errors independently. These findings underscore the critical importance of autonomous self-reflection in robotic systems while effectively addressing the challenges posed by ambiguous-condition environments.</p></details> |  |

Currently, most research focuses on proprioception-based methods, which lack the capability to overcome complex terrain. While visual perception is vital for operation in human-centric environments, its integration complicates control further. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have shown promise in enhancing legged robot locomotion, particularly with proprioception-based methods. However, terrain adaptability, especially for bipedal robots, remains a significant challenge, with most research focusing on flat-terrain scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel mixture of experts teacher-student network RL strategy, which enhances the performance of teacher-student policies based on visual inputs through a simple yet effective approach. Our method combines terrain selection strategies with the teacher policy, resulting in superior performance compared to traditional models. Additionally, we introduce an alignment loss between the teacher and student networks, rather than enforcing strict similarity, to improve the student's ability to navigate diverse terrains. We validate our approach experimentally on the Limx Dynamic P1 bipedal robot, demonstrating its feasibility and robustness across multiple terrain types.</p></details> |  |

The Impact of Demonstration Modality on Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07017v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning is a promising approach for learning robot policies with user-provided data. The way demonstrations are provided, i.e., demonstration modality, influences the quality of the data. While existing research shows that kinesthetic teaching (physically guiding the robot) is preferred by users for the intuitiveness and ease of use, the majority of existing manipulation datasets were collected through teleoperation via a VR controller or spacemouse. In this work, we investigate how different demonstration modalities impact downstream learning performance as well as user experience. Specifically, we compare low-cost demonstration modalities including kinesthetic teaching, teleoperation with a VR controller, and teleoperation with a spacemouse controller. We experiment with three table-top manipulation tasks with different motion constraints. We evaluate and compare imitation learning performance using data from different demonstration modalities, and collected subjective feedback on user experience. Our results show that kinesthetic teaching is rated the most intuitive for controlling the robot and provides cleanest data for best downstream learning performance. However, it is not preferred as the way for large-scale data collection due to the physical load. Based on such insight, we propose a simple data collection scheme that relies on a small number of kinesthetic demonstrations mixed with data collected through teleoperation to achieve the best overall learning performance while maintaining low data-collection effort.</p></details> | 8 pages, ICRA |
| **[A Data-Centric Revisit of Pre-Trained Vision Models for Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06960v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision models (PVMs) are fundamental to modern robotics, yet their optimal configuration remains unclear. Through systematic evaluation, we find that while DINO and iBOT outperform MAE across visuomotor control and perception tasks, they struggle when trained on non-(single-)object-centric (NOC) data--a limitation strongly correlated with their diminished ability to learn object-centric representations. This investigation indicates that the ability to form object-centric representations from the non-object-centric robotics dataset is the key to success for PVMs. Motivated by this discovery, we designed SlotMIM, a method that induces object-centric representations by introducing a semantic bottleneck to reduce the number of prototypes to encourage the emergence of objectness as well as cross-view consistency regularization for encouraging multiview invariance. Our experiments encompass pre-training on object-centric, scene-centric, web-crawled, and ego-centric data. Across all settings, our approach learns transferrable representations and achieves significant improvements over prior work in image recognition, scene understanding, and robot learning evaluations. When scaled up with million-scale datasets, our method also demonstrates superior data efficiency and scalability. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/SlotMIM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

This work takes one step in this direction. Robi Butler is a new household robot assistant that enables seamless multimodal remote interaction. It allows the human user to monitor its environment from a first-person view, issue voice or text commands, and specify target objects through hand-pointing gestures. At its core, a high-level behavior module, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), interprets multimodal instructions to generate multistep action plans. Each plan consists of open-vocabulary primitives supported by vision-language models, enabling the robot to process both textual and gestural inputs. Zoom provides a convenient interface to implement remote interactions between the human and the robot. The integration of these components allows Robi Butler to ground remote multimodal instructions in real-world home environments in a zero-shot manner. We evaluated the system on various household tasks, demonstrating its ability to execute complex user commands with multimodal inputs. We also conducted a user study to examine how multimodal interaction influences user experiences in remote human-robot interaction. These results suggest that with the advances in robot foundation models, we are moving closer to the reality of remote household robot assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Prior work in modeling brush stroke trajectories either does not work with real-world robotics or is not flexible enough to capture the complexity of human-made brush strokes. In this work, we introduce Spline-FRIDA which can model complex human brush stroke trajectories. This is achieved by recording artists drawing using motion capture, modeling the extracted trajectories with an autoencoder, and introducing a novel brush stroke dynamics model to the existing robotic painting platform FRIDA. We conducted a survey and found that our open-source Spline-FRIDA approach successfully captures the stroke styles in human drawings and that Spline-FRIDA's brush strokes are more human-like, improve semantic planning, and are more artistic compared to existing robot painting systems with restrictive B\'ezier curve strokes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerated Quasi-Static FEM for Real-Time Modeling of Continuum Robots with Multiple Contacts and Large Deformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06922v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuum robots offer high flexibility and multiple degrees of freedom, making them ideal for navigating narrow lumens. However, accurately modeling their behavior under large deformations and frequent environmental contacts remains challenging. Current methods for solving the deformation of these robots, such as the Model Order Reduction and Gauss-Seidel (GS) methods, suffer from significant drawbacks. They experience reduced computational speed as the number of contact points increases and struggle to balance speed with model accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel finite element method (FEM) named Acc-FEM. Acc-FEM employs a large deformation quasi-static finite element model and integrates an accelerated solver scheme to handle multi-contact simulations efficiently. Additionally, it utilizes parallel computing with Graphics Processing Units (GPU) for real-time updates of the finite element models and collision detection. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that Acc-FEM significantly improves computational efficiency in modeling continuum robots with multiple contacts while achieving satisfactory accuracy, addressing the deficiencies of existing methods.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA2025 |

Despite its importance, trust is rarely incorporated into task allocation and reallocation algorithms for MH-MR collaboration. While prior research in single-human, single-robot interactions has shown that integrating trust significantly enhances both performance outcomes and user experience, its role in MH-MR task allocation remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Expectation Confirmation Trust (ECT) Model, a novel framework for modeling trust dynamics in MH-MR teams. We evaluate the ECT model against five existing trust models and a no-trust baseline to assess its impact on task allocation outcomes across different team configurations (2H-2R, 5H-5R, and 10H-10R). Our results show that the ECT model improves task success rate, reduces mean completion time, and lowers task error rates. These findings highlight the complexities of trust-based task allocation in MH-MR teams. We discuss the implications of incorporating trust into task allocation algorithms and propose future research directions for adaptive trust mechanisms that balance efficiency and performance in dynamic, multi-agent environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Split Covariance Intersection Filter Based Visual Localization With Accurate AprilTag Map For Warehouse Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17879v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient localization with conveniently-established map is the fundamental requirement for mobile robot operation in warehouse environments. An accurate AprilTag map can be conveniently established with the help of LiDAR-based SLAM. It is true that a LiDAR-based system is usually not commercially competitive in contrast with a vision-based system, yet fortunately for warehouse applications, only a single LiDAR-based SLAM system is needed to establish an accurate AprilTag map, whereas a large amount of visual localization systems can share this established AprilTag map for their own operations. Therefore, the cost of a LiDAR-based SLAM system is actually shared by the large amount of visual localization systems, and turns to be acceptable and even negligible for practical warehouse applications. Once an accurate AprilTag map is available, visual localization is realized as recursive estimation that fuses AprilTag measurements (i.e. AprilTag detection results) and robot motion data. AprilTag measurements may be nonlinear partial measurements; this can be handled by the well-known extended Kalman filter (EKF) in the spirit of local linearization. AprilTag measurements tend to have temporal correlation as well; however, this cannot be reasonably handled by the EKF. The split covariance intersection filter (Split CIF) is adopted to handle temporal correlation among AprilTag measurements. The Split CIF (in the spirit of local linearization) can also handle AprilTag nonlinear partial measurements. The Split CIF based visual localization system incorporates a measurement adaptive mechanism to handle outliers in AprilTag measurements and adopts a dynamic initialization mechanism to address the kidnapping problem. A comparative study in real warehouse environments demonstrates the potential and advantage of the Split CIF based visual localization solution.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their benefits, the growing adoption of LLM in robotics has raised several safety concerns, particularly regarding executing malicious or unsafe natural language prompts. In addition, ensuring that task plans, team formation, and task allocation outputs from LLMs are adequately examined, refined, or rejected is crucial for maintaining system integrity. In this paper, we introduce SafePlan, a multi-component framework that combines formal logic and chain-of-thought reasoners for enhancing the safety of LLM-based robotics systems. Using the components of SafePlan, including Prompt Sanity COT Reasoner and Invariant, Precondition, and Postcondition COT reasoners, we examined the safety of natural language task prompts, task plans, and task allocation outputs generated by LLM-based robotic systems as means of investigating and enhancing system safety profile. Our results show that SafePlan outperforms baseline models by leading to 90.5% reduction in harmful task prompt acceptance while still maintaining reasonable acceptance of safe tasks.</p></details> |  |

While VLA models offer significant capabilities, they also introduce new attack surfaces, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. With these vulnerabilities largely unexplored, this paper systematically quantifies the robustness of VLA-based robotic systems. Recognizing the unique demands of robotic execution, our attack objectives target the inherent spatial and functional characteristics of robotic systems. In particular, we introduce two untargeted attack objectives that leverage spatial foundations to destabilize robotic actions, and a targeted attack objective that manipulates the robotic trajectory. Additionally, we design an adversarial patch generation approach that places a small, colorful patch within the camera's view, effectively executing the attack in both digital and physical environments. Our evaluation reveals a marked degradation in task success rates, with up to a 100\% reduction across a suite of simulated robotic tasks, highlighting critical security gaps in current VLA architectures. By unveiling these vulnerabilities and proposing actionable evaluation metrics, we advance both the understanding and enhancement of safety for VLA-based robotic systems, underscoring the necessity for continuously developing robust defense strategies prior to physical-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github: https://github.com/William-wAng618/roboticAttack Homepage: https://vlaattacker.github.io/</p></details> |

However, the spatial and temporal misalignment between foot-end motion derived from forward kinematics and foot IMU measurements can introduce inconsistent constraints, resulting in odometry drift. Therefore, accurate spatial-temporal calibration is crucial for the multi-IMU systems. Although existing multi-IMU calibration methods have addressed passive single-rigid-body sensor calibration, they are inadequate for legged systems. This is due to the insufficient excitation from traditional gaits for calibration, and enlarged sensitivity to IMU noise during kinematic chain transformations. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$I-Calib, an anti-noise active multi-IMU calibration framework enabling autonomous spatial-temporal calibration for arbitrary foot-mounted IMUs. Our A$^2$I-Calib includes: 1) an anti-noise trajectory generator leveraging a proposed basis function selection theorem to minimize the condition number in correlation analysis, thus reducing noise sensitivity, and 2) a reinforcement learning (RL)-based controller that ensures robust execution of calibration motions. Furthermore, A$^2$I-Calib is validated on simulation and real-world quadruped robot platforms with various multi-IMU settings, which demonstrates a significant reduction in noise sensitivity and calibration errors, thereby improving the overall multi-IMU odometry performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking Generalization for Robotics via Modularity and Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06814v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we build generalist robot systems? Scale may not be enough due to the significant multimodality of robotics tasks, lack of easily accessible data and the challenges of deploying on physical hardware. Meanwhile, most deployed robotic systems today are inherently modular and can leverage the independent generalization capabilities of each module to perform well. Therefore, this thesis seeks to tackle the task of building generalist robot agents by integrating these components into one: combining modularity with large-scale learning for general purpose robot control. The first question we consider is: how can we build modularity and hierarchy into learning systems? Our key insight is that rather than having the agent learn hierarchy and low-level control end-to-end, we can enforce modularity via planning to enable more efficient and capable robot learners. Next, we come to the role of scale in building generalist robot systems. To scale, neural networks require vast amounts of diverse data, expressive architectures to fit the data and a source of supervision to generate the data. We leverage a powerful supervision source: classical planning, which can generalize, but is expensive to run and requires access to privileged information to perform well in practice. We use these planners to supervise large-scale policy learning in simulation to produce generalist agents. Finally, we consider how to unify modularity with large-scale policy learning to build real-world robot systems capable of performing zero-shot manipulation. We do so by tightly integrating key ingredients of modular high and mid-level planning, learned local control, procedural scene generation and large-scale policy learning for sim2real transfer. We demonstrate that this recipe can produce a single, generalist agent that can solve challenging long-horizon manipulation tasks in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>CMU R...</summary><p>CMU Robotics PhD Thesis, 185 pages</p></details> |

Rather than focusing on a single optimal parameter set, we analyze the distribution and structure of multiple successful impedance solutions, revealing patterns that guide impedance selection in contactrich robotic manipulation. Experiments with a real robot and four different peg types demonstrate the presence of task-specific and generalized assembly strategies, identified through K-means Clustering. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to represent these findings, highlighting patterns in successful impedance selections. Additionally, a neural-network-based success predictor accurately estimates feasible impedance parameters, reducing the need for extensive trial-and-error tuning. By providing publicly available code, CAD files, and a trained model, this work enhances the accessibility of impedance control and offers a structured approach to programming robotic assembly tasks, particularly for less-experienced users.</p></details> |  |

Gaining a deeper understanding of robot design data can enable various applications, including automated design generation, retrieving example designs from text, and developing AI-powered design assistants.

Despite its critical role, successful vascular access remains challenging due to anatomical variability, overlying adipose tissue, and the need for precise ultrasound (US) guidance. Errors in needle placement can lead to severe complications, restricting the procedure to highly skilled clinicians in controlled hospital settings. While robotic systems have shown promise in addressing these challenges through autonomous scanning and vessel reconstruction, clinical translation remains limited due to reliance on simplified phantom models that fail to capture human anatomical complexity. In this work, we present a method for autonomous robotic US scanning of bifurcated femoral arteries, and validate it on five vascular phantoms created from real patient computed tomography (CT) data. Additionally, we introduce a video-based deep learning US segmentation network tailored for vascular imaging, enabling improved 3D arterial reconstruction. The proposed network achieves a Dice score of 89.21% and an Intersection over Union of 80.54% on a newly developed vascular dataset. The quality of the reconstructed artery centerline is evaluated against ground truth CT data, demonstrating an average L2 deviation of 0.91+/-0.70 mm, with an average Hausdorff distance of 4.36+/-1.11mm. This study is the first to validate an autonomous robotic system for US scanning of the femoral artery on a diverse set of patient-specific phantoms, introducing a more advanced framework for evaluating robotic performance in vascular imaging and intervention.</p></details> |  |

AutoMisty incorporates four specialized agent modules to manage task decomposition, assignment, problem-solving, and result synthesis. Each agent incorporates a two-layer optimization mechanism, with self-reflection for iterative refinement and human-in-the-loop for better alignment with user preferences. AutoMisty ensures a transparent reasoning process, allowing users to iteratively refine tasks through natural language feedback for precise execution. To evaluate AutoMisty's effectiveness, we designed a benchmark task set spanning four levels of complexity and conducted experiments in a real Misty robot environment. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoMisty not only consistently generates high-quality code but also enables precise code control, significantly outperforming direct reasoning with ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o1.

In this work, we introduce a novel co-working framework for robots that unifies goal-oriented semantic communication (SemCom) with a Generative AI (GenAI)-agent under a semantic-aware network. SemCom prioritizes the exchange of meaningful information among robots and the network, thereby reducing overhead and latency. Meanwhile, the GenAI-agent leverages generative AI models to interpret high-level task instructions, allocate resources, and adapt to dynamic changes in both network and robotic environments. This agent-driven paradigm ushers in a new level of autonomy and intelligence, enabling complex tasks of networked robots to be conducted with minimal human intervention. We validate our approach through a multi-robot anomaly detection use-case simulation, where robots detect, compress, and transmit relevant information for classification. Simulation results confirm that SemCom significantly reduces data traffic while preserving critical semantic details, and the GenAI-agent ensures task coordination and network adaptation. This synergy provides a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for modern industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures.

However, current visual grasp detection methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) often struggle to adapt to diverse scenarios, as they tend to emphasize either local or global features exclusively, neglecting complementary cues. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer approach to address these challenges. Our method improves robotic visual grasping by effectively capturing both global and local information through the integration of Vision Mamba and parallel convolutional-transformer blocks. This hybrid architecture significantly improves adaptability, precision, and flexibility across various robotic tasks. To ensure a fair evaluation, we conducted extensive experiments on the Cornell, Jacquard, and OCID-Grasp datasets, ranging from simple to complex scenarios. Additionally, we performed both simulated and real-world robotic experiments. The results demonstrate that our method not only surpasses state-of-the-art techniques on standard grasping datasets but also delivers strong performance in both simulation and real-world robot applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A vision-based robotic system for precision pollination of apples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19918v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global food production depends upon successful pollination, a process that relies on natural and managed pollinators. However, natural pollinators are declining due to factors such as climate change, habitat loss, and pesticide use. This paper presents an integrated robotic system for precision pollination in apples. The system consisted of a machine vision system to identify target flower clusters and estimate their positions and orientations, and a manipulator motion planning and actuation system to guide the sprayer to apply charged pollen suspension to the target flower clusters. The system was tested in the lab, followed by field evaluation in Honeycrisp and Fuji orchards. In the Honeycrisp variety, the robotic pollination system achieved a fruit set of 34.8% of sprayed flowers with 87.5% of flower clusters having at least one fruit when a 2 gm/l pollen suspension was used. In comparison, the natural pollination technique achieved a fruit set of 43.1% with 94.9% of clusters with at least one fruit. In Fuji apples, the robotic system achieved lower pollination success, with 7.2% of sprayed flowers setting fruit and 20.6% of clusters having at least one fruit, compared to 33.1% and 80.6%, respectively, with natural pollination. Fruit quality analysis showed that robotically pollinated fruits were comparable to naturally pollinated fruits in terms of color, weight, diameter, firmness, soluble solids, and starch content. Additionally, the system cycle time was 6.5 seconds per cluster. The results showed a promise for robotic pollination in apple orchards. However, further research and development is needed to improve the system and assess its suitability across diverse orchard environments and apple cultivars.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> |
| **[Learning-based Control for Tendon-Driven Continuum Robotic Arms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04829v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a learning-based approach for centralized position control of Tendon Driven Continuum Robots (TDCRs) using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), with a particular focus on the Sim-to-Real transfer of control policies. The proposed control method employs the Modified Transpose Jacobian (MTJ) control strategy, with its parameters optimally tuned using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Classical model-based controllers encounter significant challenges due to the inherent uncertainties and nonlinear dynamics of continuum robots. In contrast, model-free control strategies require efficient gain-tuning to handle diverse operational scenarios. This research aims to develop a model-free controller with performance comparable to model-based strategies by integrating an optimal adaptive gain-tuning system. Both simulations and real-world implementations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the trajectory-tracking performance of continuum robots independent of initial conditions and paths within the operational task-space, effectively establishing a task-free controller.</p></details> |  |

Drawing inspiration from the natural f light dynamics of butterflies, a theoretical model is developed to investigate the impact of abdominal undulation on flight performance. To validate the model, motion capture experi ments are conducted on three configurations: a BRB without an abdomen, with a fixed abdomen, and with an undulating abdomen. The results demonstrate that abdominal undulation enhances lift generation, extends flight duration, and stabilizes pitch oscillations, thereby improving overall flight performance. These findings underscore the significance of wing-abdomen interaction in flapping-wing aerial vehicles (FWAVs) and lay the groundwork for future advancements in energy-efficient biomimetic flight designs.</p></details> |  |

However, imaging organs with large tissue movements, such as those caused by respiration, presents substantial challenges. Existing methods often require breath holding to maintain accumulation accuracy, which limits data acquisition time and ULM image saturation. To improve image quality in the presence of large tissue movements, this study introduces an approach integrating high-frame-rate ultrasound with online precise robotic probe control. Tested on a microvasculature phantom with translation motions up to 20 mm, twice the aperture size of the matrix array used, our method achieved real-time tracking of the moving phantom and imaging volume rate at 85 Hz, keeping majority of the target volume in the imaging field of view. ULM images of the moving cross channels in the phantom were successfully reconstructed in post-processing, demonstrating the feasibility of super-resolution imaging under large tissue motions. This represents a significant step towards ULM imaging of organs with large motion.</p></details> |  |

Current SLAM benchmarks overlook the significance of repeatability (precision), despite its importance in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we propose a task-driven approach to SLAM benchmarking, TaskSLAM-Bench. It employs precision as a key metric, accounts for SLAM's mapping capabilities, and has easy-to-meet implementation requirements. Simulated and real-world testing scenarios of SLAM methods provide insights into the navigation performance properties of modern visual and LiDAR SLAM solutions. The outcomes show that passive stereo SLAM operates at a level of precision comparable to LiDAR SLAM in typical indoor environments. TaskSLAM-Bench complements existing benchmarks and offers richer assessment of SLAM performance in navigation-focused scenarios. Publicly available code permits in-situ SLAM testing in custom environments with properly equipped robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 1 table.

| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Semi-Autonomous Control for Magnetic Micro-robot Navigation with Immersive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06359v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic micro-robots have demonstrated immense potential in biomedical applications, such as in vivo drug delivery, non-invasive diagnostics, and cell-based therapies, owing to their precise maneuverability and small size. However, current micromanipulation techniques often rely solely on a two-dimensional (2D) microscopic view as sensory feedback, while traditional control interfaces do not provide an intuitive manner for operators to manipulate micro-robots. These limitations increase the cognitive load on operators, who must interpret limited feedback and translate it into effective control actions. To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Semi-Autonomous Control (DRL-SC) framework for magnetic micro-robot navigation in a simulated microvascular system. Our framework integrates Mixed Reality (MR) to facilitate immersive manipulation of micro-robots, thereby enhancing situational awareness and control precision. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves navigation efficiency, reduces control errors, and enhances the overall robustness of the system in simulated microvascular environments.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA |
| **[Autoregressive Action Sequence Learning for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03132v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing a universal policy architecture that performs well across diverse robots and task configurations remains a key challenge. In this work, we address this by representing robot actions as sequential data and generating actions through autoregressive sequence modeling. Existing autoregressive architectures generate end-effector waypoints sequentially as word tokens in language modeling, which are limited to low-frequency control tasks. Unlike language, robot actions are heterogeneous and often include continuous values -- such as joint positions, 2D pixel coordinates, and end-effector poses -- which are not easily suited for language-based modeling. Based on this insight, we introduce a straightforward enhancement: we extend causal transformers' single-token prediction to support predicting a variable number of tokens in a single step through our Chunking Causal Transformer (CCT). This enhancement enables robust performance across diverse tasks of various control frequencies, greater efficiency by having fewer autoregression steps, and lead to a hybrid action sequence design by mixing different types of actions and using a different chunk size for each action type. Based on CCT, we propose the Autoregressive Policy (ARP) architecture, which solves manipulation tasks by generating hybrid action sequences. We evaluate ARP across diverse robotic manipulation environments, including Push-T, ALOHA, and RLBench, and show that ARP, as a universal architecture, matches or outperforms the environment-specific state-of-the-art in all tested benchmarks, while being more efficient in computation and parameter sizes. Videos of our real robot demonstrations, all source code and the pretrained models of ARP can be found at http://github.com/mlzxy/arp.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RA-L 2025</p></details> |

Furthermore, they need to adapt to new social scenarios that can arise during robot navigation. In this paper, we present a novel Online Lifelong Vision Language architecture, OLiVia- Nav, which uniquely integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with an online lifelong learning framework for robot social navigation. We introduce a unique distillation approach, Social Context Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (SC-CLIP), to transfer the social reasoning capabilities of large VLMs to a lightweight VLM, in order for OLiVia-Nav to directly encode social and environment context during robot navigation. These encoded embeddings are used to generate and select robot social compliant trajectories. The lifelong learning capabilities of SC-CLIP enable OLiVia-Nav to update the robot trajectory planning overtime as new social scenarios are encountered. We conducted extensive real-world experiments in diverse social navigation scenarios. The results showed that OLiVia-Nav outperformed existing state-of-the-art DRL and VLM methods in terms of mean squared error, Hausdorff loss, and personal space violation duration. Ablation studies also verified the design choices for OLiVia-Nav.</p></details> |  |

While previous research has explored turn-taking models in controlled environments, their robustness in real-world settings remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a noise-robust voice activity projection (VAP) model, based on a Transformer architecture, to enhance real-time turn-taking in dialogue robots. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we conducted a field experiment in a shopping mall, comparing the VAP system with a conventional cloud-based speech recognition system. Our analysis covered both subjective user evaluations and objective behavioral analysis. The results showed that the proposed system significantly reduced response latency, leading to a more natural conversation where both the robot and users responded faster. The subjective evaluations suggested that faster responses contribute to a better interaction experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAT-Grasp: Gesture-Driven Affordance Transfer for Task-Aware Robotic Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06227v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise and generalizable grasping across diverse objects and environments is essential for intelligent and collaborative robotic systems. However, existing approaches often struggle with ambiguous affordance reasoning and limited adaptability to unseen objects, leading to suboptimal grasp execution. In this work, we propose GAT-Grasp, a gesture-driven grasping framework that directly utilizes human hand gestures to guide the generation of task-specific grasp poses with appropriate positioning and orientation. Specifically, we introduce a retrieval-based affordance transfer paradigm, leveraging the implicit correlation between hand gestures and object affordances to extract grasping knowledge from large-scale human-object interaction videos. By eliminating the reliance on pre-given object priors, GAT-Grasp enables zero-shot generalization to novel objects and cluttered environments. Real-world evaluations confirm its robustness across diverse and unseen scenarios, demonstrating reliable grasp execution in complex task settings.</p></details> | under review |
| **[FlowMP: Learning Motion Fields for Robot Planning with Conditional Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06135v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior flow matching methods in robotics have primarily learned velocity fields to morph one distribution of trajectories into another. In this work, we extend flow matching to capture second-order trajectory dynamics, incorporating acceleration effects either explicitly in the model or implicitly through the learning objective. Unlike diffusion models, which rely on a noisy forward process and iterative denoising steps, flow matching trains a continuous transformation (flow) that directly maps a simple prior distribution to the target trajectory distribution without any denoising procedure. By modeling trajectories with second-order dynamics, our approach ensures that generated robot motions are smooth and physically executable, avoiding the jerky or dynamically infeasible trajectories that first-order models might produce. We empirically demonstrate that this second-order conditional flow matching yields superior performance on motion planning benchmarks, achieving smoother trajectories and higher success rates than baseline planners. These findings highlight the advantage of learning acceleration-aware motion fields, as our method outperforms existing motion planning methods in terms of trajectory quality and planning success.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAR: A Foundation Model-driven Framework for Robust Task Planning and Failure Recovery in Robotic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06060v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern robotic systems, deployed across domains from industrial automation to domestic assistance, face a critical challenge: executing tasks with precision and adaptability in dynamic, unpredictable environments. To address this, we propose STAR (Smart Task Adaptation and Recovery), a novel framework that synergizes Foundation Models (FMs) with dynamically expanding Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enable resilient task planning and autonomous failure recovery. While FMs offer remarkable generalization and contextual reasoning, their limitations, including computational inefficiency, hallucinations, and output inconsistencies hinder reliable deployment. STAR mitigates these issues by embedding learned knowledge into structured, reusable KGs, which streamline information retrieval, reduce redundant FM computations, and provide precise, scenario-specific insights. The framework leverages FM-driven reasoning to diagnose failures, generate context-aware recovery strategies, and execute corrective actions without human intervention or system restarts. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on rigid protocols, STAR dynamically expands its KG with experiential knowledge, ensuring continuous adaptation to novel scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we developed a comprehensive dataset that includes various robotic tasks and failure scenarios. Through extensive experimentation, STAR demonstrated an 86% task planning accuracy and 78% recovery success rate, showing significant improvements over baseline methods. The framework's ability to continuously learn from experience while maintaining structured knowledge representation makes it particularly suitable for long-term deployment in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Object Properties Using Robot Proprioception via Differentiable Robot-Object Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03920v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable simulation has become a powerful tool for system identification. While prior work has focused on identifying robot properties using robot-specific data or object properties using object-specific data, our approach calibrates object properties by using information from the robot, without relying on data from the object itself. Specifically, we utilize robot joint encoder information, which is commonly available in standard robotic systems. Our key observation is that by analyzing the robot's reactions to manipulated objects, we can infer properties of those objects, such as inertia and softness. Leveraging this insight, we develop differentiable simulations of robot-object interactions to inversely identify the properties of the manipulated objects. Our approach relies solely on proprioception -- the robot's internal sensing capabilities -- and does not require external measurement tools or vision-based tracking systems. This general method is applicable to any articulated robot and requires only joint position information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a low-cost robotic platform, achieving accurate mass and elastic modulus estimations of manipulated objects with just a few seconds of computation on a laptop.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin comment: This version has been removed by arXiv administrators as the submitter did not have the rights to agree to the license at the time of submission</p></details> |
| **[Energy-Efficient Motion Planner for Legged Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06050v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an online motion planner for legged robot locomotion with the primary objective of achieving energy efficiency. The conceptual idea is to leverage a placement set of footstep positions based on the robot's body position to determine when and how to execute steps. In particular, the proposed planner uses virtual placement sets beneath the hip joints of the legs and executes a step when the foot is outside of such placement set. Furthermore, we propose a parameter design framework that considers both energy-efficiency and robustness measures to optimize the gait by changing the shape of the placement set along with other parameters, such as step height and swing time, as a function of walking speed. We show that the planner produces trajectories that have a low Cost of Transport (CoT) and high robustness measure, and evaluate our approach against model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) and motion imitation using biological dog motion priors as the reference. Overall, within low to medium velocity range, we show a 50.4% improvement in CoT and improved robustness over model-free RL, our best performing baseline. Finally, we show ability to handle slippery surfaces, gait transitions, and disturbances in simulation and hardware with the Unitree A1 robot.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Active Vision Might Be All You Need: Exploring Active Vision in Bimanual Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17435v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning has demonstrated significant potential in performing high-precision manipulation tasks using visual feedback. However, it is common practice in imitation learning for cameras to be fixed in place, resulting in issues like occlusion and limited field of view. Furthermore, cameras are often placed in broad, general locations, without an effective viewpoint specific to the robot's task. In this work, we investigate the utility of active vision (AV) for imitation learning and manipulation, in which, in addition to the manipulation policy, the robot learns an AV policy from human demonstrations to dynamically change the robot's camera viewpoint to obtain better information about its environment and the given task. We introduce AV-ALOHA, a new bimanual teleoperation robot system with AV, an extension of the ALOHA 2 robot system, incorporating an additional 7-DoF robot arm that only carries a stereo camera and is solely tasked with finding the best viewpoint. This camera streams stereo video to an operator wearing a virtual reality (VR) headset, allowing the operator to control the camera pose using head and body movements. The system provides an immersive teleoperation experience, with bimanual first-person control, enabling the operator to dynamically explore and search the scene and simultaneously interact with the environment. We conduct imitation learning experiments of our system both in real-world and in simulation, across a variety of tasks that emphasize viewpoint planning. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of human-guided AV for imitation learning, showing significant improvements over fixed cameras in tasks with limited visibility.

Existing deception methods primarily focus on increasing opacity or misdirecting agents away from their goal or itinerary. In this work, we propose a deception problem aiming to mislead the robot towards a decoy goal through altering sensor events under a constrained budget of alteration. The environment along with the robot's interaction with it is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and the robot's action selection is governed by a Finite State Controller (FSC). Given a constrained budget for sensor event modifications, the objective is to compute a sensor alteration that maximizes the probability of the robot reaching a decoy goal. We establish the computational hardness of the problem by a reduction from the $0/1$ Knapsack problem and propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation to compute optimal deception strategies. We show the efficacy of our MILP formulation via a sequence of experiments.</p></details> |  |

While previous research has explored low-level command recovery in teleoperation setups, our work investigates high-level motion recovery from script-based control interfaces. We evaluate the efficacy of prominent website fingerprinting techniques (e.g., Tik-Tok, RF) and their limitations in accurately identifying robotic actions due to their inability to capture detailed temporal relationships. To address this, we introduce a traffic classification approach using signal processing techniques, demonstrating high accuracy in action identification and highlighting the vulnerability of encrypted communications to privacy breaches. Additionally, we explore defenses such as packet padding and timing manipulation, revealing the challenges in balancing traffic analysis resistance with network efficiency. Our findings emphasize the need for continued development of practical defenses in robotic privacy and security.</p></details> | 22 pages |

Typical robotic calibration approaches, however, are not applicable to surgical robots, such as the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK), due to joint angle measurement errors from cable-drives and the partially visible kinematic chain. Hence, previous works in surgical robotic automation used tracking algorithms to estimate the pose of the surgical tool in real-time and compensate for the joint angle errors. However, a big limitation of these previous tracking works is the initialization step which relied on only keypoints and SolvePnP. In this work, we fully explore the potential of geometric primitives beyond just keypoints with differentiable rendering, cylinders, and construct a versatile pose matching pipeline in a novel pose hypothesis space. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our single-shot calibration method with both calibration consistency and real surgical tasks. As a result, this marker-less calibration approach proves to be a robust and generalizable initialization step for surgical tool tracking.</p></details> |  |

In critical situations, such as fires or earthquakes, collaborative robots can assist first-responders by entering damaged buildings and locating missing persons, mitigating potential losses. Unlike previous solutions that overlook the critical aspect of energy management, in this paper we propose REACT, a smart energy-aware orchestrator that optimizes the exploration phase, ensuring prolonged operational time and effective area coverage. Our solution leverages a fleet of collaborative robots equipped with advanced sensors and communication capabilities to explore and navigate unknown indoor environments, such as smart factories affected by fires or earthquakes, with high density of obstacles. By leveraging real-time data exchange and cooperative algorithms, the robots dynamically adjust their paths, minimize redundant movements and reduce energy consumption. Extensive simulations confirm that our approach significantly improves the efficiency and reliability of search and rescue missions in complex indoor environments, improving the exploration rate by 10% over existing methods and reaching a map coverage of 97% under time critical operations, up to nearly 100% under relaxed time constraint.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, accepted at IEEE ICRA 2025</p></details> |

The framework leverages a spatial-temporal transformer to capture social and temporal dependencies, enabling more accurate spatial-temporal environmental dynamics understanding and port-Hamiltonian physical interactive process construction. Additionally, reinforcement learning from human feedback is employed to fine-tune robot policies, ensuring adaptation to human preferences and social norms.

Hyper-SAMARL models the environmental dynamics between robots, humans, and points of interest (POIs) using a hypergraph, enabling adaptive task assignment and socially-compliant navigation through a hypergraph diffusion mechanism. Our framework, trained with MARL, effectively captures interactions between robots and humans, adapting tasks based on real-time changes in human activity.

Simulation-based learning and sim-to-real transfer have led to recent success in solving assembly tasks in the presence of object pose variation, perception noise, and control error; however, the development of a generalist (i.e., multi-task) agent for a broad range of assembly tasks has been limited by the need to manually curate assembly assets, which greatly constrains the number and diversity of assembly problems that can be used for policy learning. Inspired by recent success of using generative AI to scale up robot learning, we propose MatchMaker, a pipeline to automatically generate diverse, simulation-compatible assembly asset pairs to facilitate learning assembly skills. Specifically, MatchMaker can 1) take a simulation-incompatible, interpenetrating asset pair as input, and automatically convert it into a simulation-compatible, interpenetration-free pair, 2) take an arbitrary single asset as input, and generate a geometrically-mating asset to create an asset pair, 3) automatically erode contact surfaces from (1) or (2) according to a user-specified clearance parameter to generate realistic parts. We demonstrate that data generated by MatchMaker outperforms previous work in terms of diversity and effectiveness for downstream assembly skill learning.

An analysis of existing robotics benchmarks reveals that successful task performance hinges on three key whole-body control capabilities: bimanual coordination, stable and precise navigation, and extensive end-effector reachability. Achieving these capabilities requires careful hardware design, but the resulting system complexity further complicates visuomotor policy learning. To address these challenges, we introduce the BEHAVIOR Robot Suite (BRS), a comprehensive framework for whole-body manipulation in diverse household tasks. Built on a bimanual, wheeled robot with a 4-DoF torso, BRS integrates a cost-effective whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection and a novel algorithm for learning whole-body visuomotor policies. We evaluate BRS on five challenging household tasks that not only emphasize the three core capabilities but also introduce additional complexities, such as long-range navigation, interaction with articulated and deformable objects, and manipulation in confined spaces.

Particularly, in safety-critical domains like surgical applications, obtaining high-quality data can be especially difficult. It poses challenges to researchers seeking to exploit recent advancements in reinforcement learning and imitation learning, which have greatly improved generalizability and enabled robots to conduct tasks autonomously. We introduce dARt Vinci, a scalable data collection platform for robot learning in surgical settings. The system uses Augmented Reality (AR) hand tracking and a high-fidelity physics engine to capture subtle maneuvers in primitive surgical tasks: By eliminating the need for a physical robot setup and providing flexibility in terms of time, space, and hardware resources-such as multiview sensors and actuators-specialized simulation is a viable alternative. At the same time, AR allows the robot data collection to be more egocentric, supported by its body tracking and content overlaying capabilities. Our user study confirms the proposed system's efficiency and usability, where we use widely-used primitive tasks for training teleoperation with da Vinci surgical robots. Data throughput improves across all tasks compared to real robot settings by 41% on average. The total experiment time is reduced by an average of 10%. The temporal demand in the task load survey is improved. These gains are statistically significant. Additionally, the collected data is over 400 times smaller in size, requiring far less storage while achieving double the frequency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Limits of specifiability for sensor-based robotic planning tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05623v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is now a large body of techniques, many based on formal methods, for describing and realizing complex robotics tasks, including those involving a variety of rich goals and time-extended behavior. This paper explores the limits of what sorts of tasks are specifiable, examining how the precise grounding of specifications, that is, whether the specification is given in terms of the robot's states, its actions and observations, its knowledge, or some other information,is crucial to whether a given task can be specified. While prior work included some description of particular choices for this grounding, our contribution treats this aspect as a first-class citizen: we introduce notation to deal with a large class of problems, and examine how the grounding affects what tasks can be posed. The results demonstrate that certain classes of tasks are specifiable under different combinations of groundings.</p></details> |  |

This is especially true when dealing with complex robotic systems, such as those with dual arms employed for their improved payload capacity and manipulability. However, a key challenge is in expanding the robotic movements beyond the learned scenarios to adapt to minor and major variations from the specific demonstrations. In this work, we propose a learning and novel generalization approach that adapts the learned Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-parameterized policy derived from human demonstrations. Our method requires only a small number of human demonstrations and eliminates the need for a robotic system during the demonstration phase, which can significantly reduce both cost and time. The generalization process takes place directly in the parameter space, leveraging the lower-dimensional representation of GMM parameters. With only three parameters per Gaussian component, this process is computationally efficient and yields immediate results upon request. We validate our approach through real-world experiments involving a dual-arm robotic manipulation of boxes. Starting with just five demonstrations for a single task, our approach successfully generalizes to new unseen scenarios, including new target locations, orientations, and box sizes. These results highlight the practical applicability and scalability of our method for complex manipulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

Robotic Ultrasound Systems (RUSS) aim to address these limitations by providing standardized and automated imaging solutions, especially in environments with limited access to skilled operators. This paper presents the development of a novel RUSS system that employs dual RGB-D depth cameras to maintain the US probe normal to the skin surface, a critical factor for optimal image quality. Our RUSS integrates RGB-D camera data with robotic control algorithms to maintain orthogonal probe alignment on uneven surfaces without preoperative data. Validation tests using a phantom model demonstrate that the system achieves robust normal positioning accuracy while delivering ultrasound images comparable to those obtained through manual scanning. A-SEE2.0 demonstrates 2.47 ${\pm}$ 1.25 degrees error for flat surface normal-positioning and 12.19 ${\pm}$ 5.81 degrees normal estimation error on mannequin surface. This work highlights the potential of A-SEE2.0 to be used in clinical practice by testing its performance during in-vivo forearm ultrasound examinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted for review</p></details> |

| **[Design, Dynamic Modeling and Control of a 2-DOF Robotic Wrist Actuated by Twisted and Coiled Actuators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05508v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic wrists play a pivotal role in the functionality of industrial manipulators and humanoid robots, facilitating manipulation and grasping tasks. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in integrating artificial muscle-driven actuators for robotic wrists, driven by advancements in technology offering high energy density, lightweight construction, and compact designs. However, in the study of robotic wrists driven by artificial muscles, dynamic model-based controllers are often overlooked, despite their critical importance for motion analysis and dynamic control of robots. This paper presents a novel design of a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) robotic wrist driven by twisted and coiled actuators (TCA) utilizing a parallel mechanism with a 3RRRR configuration. The proposed robotic wrist is expected to feature lightweight structures and superior motion performance while mitigating friction issues. The Lagrangian dynamic model of the wrist is established, along with a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) designed for trajectory tracking tasks. A prototype of the robotic wrist is developed, and extensive experiments are conducted to validate its superior motion performance and the proposed dynamic model. Subsequently, extensive comparative experiments between NMPC and PID controller were conducted under various operating conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the dynamic model-based controller in the motion control of TCA-driven robotic wrists.</p></details> |  |

The concept is meant for a leader-follower task and takes a minimalist approach that focuses on exploiting the robots' payload capabilities and reducing energy consumption, without compromising the robot locomotion capabilities. We introduce a preliminary arm mechanical design and describe how to use its joint displacements to guide the robot's motion. To control the robot's locomotion, we propose a decentralized Model Predictive Controller that incorporates an approximation of the arm dynamics and the estimation of the external forces from the collaborative carrying. We validate the overall system experimentally by performing both robot-robot and human-robot collaborative carrying on a stair-like obstacle and on rough terrain.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has 8 pages and 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Self-Modeling Robots by Photographing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05398v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-modeling enables robots to build task-agnostic models of their morphology and kinematics based on data that can be automatically collected, with minimal human intervention and prior information, thereby enhancing machine intelligence. Recent research has highlighted the potential of data-driven technology in modeling the morphology and kinematics of robots. However, existing self-modeling methods suffer from either low modeling quality or excessive data acquisition costs. Beyond morphology and kinematics, texture is also a crucial component of robots, which is challenging to model and remains unexplored. In this work, a high-quality, texture-aware, and link-level method is proposed for robot self-modeling. We utilize three-dimensional (3D) Gaussians to represent the static morphology and texture of robots, and cluster the 3D Gaussians to construct neural ellipsoid bones, whose deformations are controlled by the transformation matrices generated by a kinematic neural network. The 3D Gaussians and kinematic neural network are trained using data pairs composed of joint angles, camera parameters and multi-view images without depth information. By feeding the kinematic neural network with joint angles, we can utilize the well-trained model to describe the corresponding morphology, kinematics and texture of robots at the link level, and render robot images from different perspectives with the aid of 3D Gaussian splatting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the established model can be exploited to perform downstream tasks such as motion planning and inverse kinematics.</p></details> |  |
