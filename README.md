| **[Functionality understanding and segmentation in 3D scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16310v4)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

| **[SIGHT: Single-Image Conditioned Generation of Hand Trajectories for Hand-Object Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22869v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel task of generating realistic and diverse 3D hand trajectories given a single image of an object, which could be involved in a hand-object interaction scene or pictured by itself. When humans grasp an object, appropriate trajectories naturally form in our minds to use it for specific tasks. Hand-object interaction trajectory priors can greatly benefit applications in robotics, embodied AI, augmented reality and related fields. However, synthesizing realistic and appropriate hand trajectories given a single object or hand-object interaction image is a highly ambiguous task, requiring to correctly identify the object of interest and possibly even the correct interaction among many possible alternatives. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose the SIGHT-Fusion system, consisting of a curated pipeline for extracting visual features of hand-object interaction details from egocentric videos involving object manipulation, and a diffusion-based conditional motion generation model processing the extracted features. We train our method given video data with corresponding hand trajectory annotations, without supervision in the form of action labels. For the evaluation, we establish benchmarks utilizing the first-person FPHAB and HOI4D datasets, testing our method against various baselines and using multiple metrics. We also introduce task simulators for executing the generated hand trajectories and reporting task success rates as an additional metric. Experiments show that our method generates more appropriate and realistic hand trajectories than baselines and presents promising generalization capability on unseen objects. The accuracy of the generated hand trajectories is confirmed in a physics simulation setting, showcasing the authenticity of the created sequences and their applicability in downstream uses.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeGuE: Semantic Guided Exploration for Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03629v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of embodied AI applications has enabled robots to perform complex tasks which require a sophisticated understanding of their environment. To enable successful robot operation in such settings, maps must be constructed so that they include semantic information, in addition to geometric information. In this paper, we address the novel problem of semantic exploration, whereby a mobile robot must autonomously explore an environment to fully map both its structure and the semantic appearance of features. We develop a method based on next-best-view exploration, where potential poses are scored based on the semantic features visible from that pose. We explore two alternative methods for sampling potential views and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulation and physical experiments. Automatic creation of high-quality semantic maps can enable robots to better understand and interact with their environments and enable future embodied AI applications to be more easily deployed.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Decision SpikeFormer: Spike-Driven Transformer for Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03800v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy training solely on pre-collected data, avoiding direct environment interaction - a crucial benefit for energy-constrained embodied AI applications. Although Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)-based methods perform well in offline RL, their high computational and energy demands motivate exploration of more efficient alternatives. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) show promise for such tasks, given their low power consumption. In this work, we introduce DSFormer, the first spike-driven transformer model designed to tackle offline RL via sequence modeling. Unlike existing SNN transformers focused on spatial dimensions for vision tasks, we develop Temporal Spiking Self-Attention (TSSA) and Positional Spiking Self-Attention (PSSA) in DSFormer to capture the temporal and positional dependencies essential for sequence modeling in RL. Additionally, we propose Progressive Threshold-dependent Batch Normalization (PTBN), which combines the benefits of LayerNorm and BatchNorm to preserve temporal dependencies while maintaining the spiking nature of SNNs. Comprehensive results in the D4RL benchmark show DSFormer's superiority over both SNN and ANN counterparts, achieving 78.4% energy savings, highlighting DSFormer's advantages not only in energy efficiency but also in competitive performance. Code and models are public at https://wei-nijuan.github.io/DecisionSpikeFormer.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[3D-Mem: 3D Scene Memory for Embodied Exploration and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17735v5)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing compact and informative 3D scene representations is essential for effective embodied exploration and reasoning, especially in complex environments over extended periods. Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Using the BridgeData V2 dataset, we generate fine-tuned image captions with a pretrained BLIP-2 vision-language model and combine them with visual features through an early fusion strategy. The fused representations are processed using Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agents. Experimental results demonstrate that multimodal agents achieve a 20% improvement in task completion rates and significantly outperform visual-only and textual-only baselines after sufficient training. Compared to transformer-based and recurrent multimodal RL models, our approach achieves superior performance in cumulative reward and caption quality metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L). These results highlight the impact of semantically aligned language cues in enhancing agent learning efficiency and generalization. The proposed framework contributes to the advancement of multimodal reinforcement learning and embodied AI systems in dynamic, real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 14 figures and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[TokenHSI: Unified Synthesis of Physical Human-Scene Interactions through Task Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19901v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing diverse and physically plausible Human-Scene Interactions (HSI) is pivotal for both computer animation and embodied AI. Despite encouraging progress, current methods mainly focus on developing separate controllers, each specialized for a specific interaction task. This significantly hinders the ability to tackle a wide variety of challenging HSI tasks that require the integration of multiple skills, e.g., sitting down while carrying an object. To address this issue, we present TokenHSI, a single, unified transformer-based policy capable of multi-skill unification and flexible adaptation. The key insight is to model the humanoid proprioception as a separate shared token and combine it with distinct task tokens via a masking mechanism. Such a unified policy enables effective knowledge sharing across skills, thereby facilitating the multi-task training. Moreover, our policy architecture supports variable length inputs, enabling flexible adaptation of learned skills to new scenarios. By training additional task tokenizers, we can not only modify the geometries of interaction targets but also coordinate multiple skills to address complex tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve versatility, adaptability, and extensibility in various HSI tasks.

| **[IDMR: Towards Instance-Driven Precise Visual Correspondence in Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00954v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval systems are becoming increasingly vital for cutting-edge AI technologies, such as embodied AI and AI-driven digital content industries. However, current multimodal retrieval tasks lack sufficient complexity and demonstrate limited practical application value. It spires us to design Instance-Driven Multimodal Image Retrieval (IDMR), a novel task that requires models to retrieve images containing the same instance as a query image while matching a text-described scenario. Unlike existing retrieval tasks focused on global image similarity or category-level matching, IDMR demands fine-grained instance-level consistency across diverse contexts. To benchmark this capability, we develop IDMR-bench using real-world object tracking and first-person video data. Addressing the scarcity of training data, we propose a cross-domain synthesis method that creates 557K training samples by cropping objects from standard detection datasets. Our Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based retrieval model, trained on 1.2M samples, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both traditional benchmarks and our zero-shot IDMR-bench. Experimental results demonstrate previous models' limitations in instance-aware retrieval and highlight the potential of MLLM for advanced retrieval applications. The whole training dataset, codes and models, with wide ranges of sizes, are available at https://github.com/BwLiu01/IDMR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Agent Reasoning in Image Schemas: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Embodied Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24110v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in embodied AI, agent reasoning systems still struggle to capture the fundamental conceptual structures that humans naturally use to understand and interact with their environment. To address this, we propose a novel framework that bridges embodied cognition theory and agent systems by leveraging a formal characterization of image schemas, which are defined as recurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. By customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create a neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental conceptual structures. We argue that such an approach enhances both efficiency and interpretability while enabling more intuitive human-agent interactions through shared embodied understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[STI-Bench: Are MLLMs Ready for Precise Spatial-Temporal World Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23765v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[ManipTrans: Efficient Dexterous Bimanual Manipulation Transfer via Residual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21860v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human hands play a central role in interacting, motivating increasing research in dexterous robotic manipulation. Data-driven embodied AI algorithms demand precise, large-scale, human-like manipulation sequences, which are challenging to obtain with conventional reinforcement learning or real-world teleoperation. To address this, we introduce ManipTrans, a novel two-stage method for efficiently transferring human bimanual skills to dexterous robotic hands in simulation. ManipTrans first pre-trains a generalist trajectory imitator to mimic hand motion, then fine-tunes a specific residual module under interaction constraints, enabling efficient learning and accurate execution of complex bimanual tasks. Experiments show that ManipTrans surpasses state-of-the-art methods in success rate, fidelity, and efficiency. Leveraging ManipTrans, we transfer multiple hand-object datasets to robotic hands, creating DexManipNet, a large-scale dataset featuring previously unexplored tasks like pen capping and bottle unscrewing. DexManipNet comprises 3.3K episodes of robotic manipulation and is easily extensible, facilitating further policy training for dexterous hands and enabling real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Graphs as World Models for Semantic Material-Aware Obstacle Handling in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21232v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to infer the material properties of obstacles limits their decision-making capacity. While AVs rely on sensor systems such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar to detect obstacles, this study suggests combining sensors with a knowledge graph (KG)-based world model to improve AVs' comprehension of physical material qualities. Beyond sensor data, AVs can infer qualities such as malleability, density, and elasticity using a semantic KG that depicts the relationships between obstacles and their attributes. Using the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, we evaluated AV performance with and without KG integration. The findings demonstrate that the KG-based method improves obstacle management, which allows AVs to use material qualities to make better decisions about when to change lanes or apply emergency braking. For example, the KG-integrated AV changed lanes for hard impediments like traffic cones and successfully avoided collisions with flexible items such as plastic bags by passing over them. Compared to the control system, the KG framework demonstrated improved responsiveness to obstacles by resolving conflicting sensor data, causing emergency stops for 13.3% more cases. In addition, our method exhibits a 6.6% higher success rate in lane-changing maneuvers in experimental scenarios, particularly for larger, high-impact obstacles. While we focus particularly on autonomous driving, our work demonstrates the potential of KG-based world models to improve decision-making in embodied AI systems and scale to other domains, including robotics, healthcare, and environmental simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Reasoning Video Segmentation with Just-in-Time Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21056v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning segmentation (RS) aims to identify and segment objects of interest based on implicit text queries. As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI agents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring explicit step-by-step guidance. However, current RS approaches rely heavily on the visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs), leading to several major limitations. First, they struggle with queries that require multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex spatial/temporal relationships. Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which may require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs and may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Finally, being primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they scale poorly to online video data. To address these limitations, we propose an agent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS without LLM fine-tuning. Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time digital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- a LLM plans the construction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using specialist vision models. We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin as "just-in-time" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific information and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating every specialist model. The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin representation to identify target objects. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new comprehensive video reasoning segmentation benchmark comprising 200 videos with 895 implicit text queries. The benchmark spans three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal) with three different reasoning chain complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[DINeMo: Learning Neural Mesh Models with no 3D Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20220v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-level 3D/6D pose estimation is a crucial step towards comprehensive 3D scene understanding, which would enable a broad range of applications in robotics and embodied AI. Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations. Our project page is available at https://analysis-by-synthesis.github.io/DINeMo/.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[DataPlatter: Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the DataPlatter method, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Body Discovery of Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19941v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the pursuit of realizing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the importance of embodied artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly apparent. Following this trend, research integrating robots with AGI has become prominent. As various kinds of embodiments have been designed, adaptability to diverse embodiments will become important to AGI. We introduce a new challenge, termed "Body Discovery of Embodied AI", focusing on tasks of recognizing embodiments and summarizing neural signal functionality. The challenge encompasses the precise definition of an AI body and the intricate task of identifying embodiments in dynamic environments, where conventional approaches often prove inadequate. To address these challenges, we apply causal inference method and evaluate it by developing a simulator tailored for testing algorithms with virtual environments. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical testing, demonstrating their robust performance in various scenarios based on virtual environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation and Understanding in Vision: A Survey and New Outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18016v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal technique in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling access to external, reliable, and up-to-date knowledge sources. In the context of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), RAG has proven invaluable by augmenting model outputs with supplementary, relevant information, thus improving their quality. Recently, the potential of RAG has extended beyond natural language processing, with emerging methods integrating retrieval-augmented strategies into the computer vision (CV) domain. These approaches aim to address the limitations of relying solely on internal model knowledge by incorporating authoritative external knowledge bases, thereby improving both the understanding and generation capabilities of vision models. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV, focusing on two main areas: (I) visual understanding and (II) visual generation. In the realm of visual understanding, we systematically review tasks ranging from basic image recognition to complex applications such as medical report generation and multimodal question answering. For visual content generation, we examine the application of RAG in tasks related to image, video, and 3D generation. Furthermore, we explore recent advancements in RAG for embodied AI, with a particular focus on applications in planning, task execution, multimodal perception, interaction, and specialized domains. Given that the integration of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV is still in its early stages, we also highlight the key limitations of current approaches and propose future research directions to drive the development of this promising area.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[NavCoT: Boosting LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation via Learning Disentangled Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07376v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and tailored 3D scene understanding designs. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZeroHSI: Zero-Shot 4D Human-Scene Interaction by Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18600v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-scene interaction (HSI) generation is crucial for applications in embodied AI, virtual reality, and robotics. Yet, existing methods cannot synthesize interactions in unseen environments such as in-the-wild scenes or reconstructed scenes, as they rely on paired 3D scenes and captured human motion data for training, which are unavailable for unseen environments. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis, eliminating the need for training on any MoCap data. Our key insight is to distill human-scene interactions from state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/ The first two authors contribute equally</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Training of Generalizable Visuomotor Policies via Control-Aware Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09258v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving generalization is one key challenge in embodied AI, where obtaining large-scale datasets across diverse scenarios is costly. Traditional weak augmentations, such as cropping and flipping, are insufficient for improving a model's performance in new environments. Existing data augmentation methods often disrupt task-relevant information in images, potentially degrading performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EAGLE, an efficient training framework for generalizable visuomotor policies that improves upon existing methods by (1) enhancing generalization by applying augmentation only to control-related regions identified through a self-supervised control-aware mask and (2) improving training stability and efficiency by distilling knowledge from an expert to a visuomotor student policy, which is then deployed to unseen environments without further fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on three domains, including the DMControl Generalization Benchmark, the enhanced Robot Manipulation Distraction Benchmark, and a long-sequential drawer-opening task, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[KARMA: Augmenting Embodied AI Agents with Long-and-short Term Memory Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14908v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI agents responsible for executing interconnected, long-sequence household tasks often face difficulties with in-context memory, leading to inefficiencies and errors in task execution. To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KARMA's plug-and-play capability allows for seamless deployment on real-world robotic systems, such as mobile manipulation platforms.Through this plug-and-play memory system, KARMA significantly enhances the ability of embodied agents to generate coherent and contextually appropriate plans, making the execution of complex household tasks more efficient. The experimental videos from the work can be found at https://youtu.be/4BT7fnw9ehs. Our code is available at https://github.com/WZX0Swarm0Robotics/KARMA/tree/master.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D-GRAND: A Million-Scale Dataset for 3D-LLMs with Better Grounding and Less Hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05132v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of language and 3D perception is crucial for embodied agents and robots that comprehend and interact with the physical world. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities, their adaptation to 3D environments (3D-LLMs) remains in its early stages. A primary challenge is a lack of large-scale datasets with dense grounding between language and 3D scenes. We introduce 3D-GRAND, a pioneering large-scale dataset comprising 40,087 household scenes paired with 6.2 million densely-grounded scene-language instructions. Our results show that instruction tuning with 3D-GRAND significantly enhances grounding capabilities and reduces hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. As part of our contributions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark 3D-POPE to systematically evaluate hallucination in 3D-LLMs, enabling fair comparisons of models. Our experiments highlight a scaling effect between dataset size and 3D-LLM performance, emphasizing the importance of large-scale 3D-text datasets for embodied AI research. Our results demonstrate early signals for effective sim-to-real transfer, indicating that models trained on large synthetic data can perform well on real-world 3D scans. Through 3D-GRAND and 3D-POPE, we aim to equip the embodied AI community with resources and insights to lead to more reliable and better-grounded 3D-LLMs. Project website: https://3d-grand.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under revision at IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

In this paper, we propose SpatialBot for better spatial understanding by feeding both RGB and depth images. Additionally, we have constructed the SpatialQA dataset, which involves multi-level depth-related questions to train VLMs for depth understanding. Finally, we present SpatialBench to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' capabilities in spatial understanding at different levels. Extensive experiments on our spatial-understanding benchmark, general VLM benchmarks and Embodied AI tasks, demonstrate the remarkable improvements of SpatialBot trained on SpatialQA.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MoK-RAG, a novel multi-source RAG framework that implements a mixture of knowledge paths enhanced retrieval mechanism through functional partitioning of a large language model (LLM) corpus into distinct sections, enabling retrieval from multiple specialized knowledge paths. Applied to the generation of 3D simulated environments, our proposed MoK-RAG3D enhances this paradigm by partitioning 3D assets into distinct sections and organizing them based on a hierarchical knowledge tree structure. Different from previous methods that only use manual evaluation, we pioneered the introduction of automated evaluation methods for 3D scenes. Both automatic and human evaluations in our experiments demonstrate that MoK-RAG3D can assist Embodied AI agents in generating diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods for creating articulated objects are either data-driven or simulation based, which are limited by the scale and quality of the training data or the fidelity and heavy labour of the simulation. In this paper, we propose Infinite Mobility, a novel method for synthesizing high-fidelity articulated objects through procedural generation. User study and quantitative evaluation demonstrate that our method can produce results that excel current state-of-the-art methods and are comparable to human-annotated datasets in both physics property and mesh quality. Furthermore, we show that our synthetic data can be used as training data for generative models, enabling next-step scaling up.

| **[Exploring 3D Activity Reasoning and Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D activity reasoning and planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advance in multimodal learning. However, most existing works share two constraints: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. To bridge the gaps, we propose 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans, and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control.

We introduce the static to openable (S2O) task which creates interactive articulated 3D objects from static counterparts through openable part detection, motion prediction, and interior geometry completion. We formulate a unified framework to tackle this task, and curate a challenging dataset of openable 3D objects that serves as a test bed for systematic evaluation. Our experiments benchmark methods from prior work, extended and improved methods, and simple yet effective heuristics for the S2O task. We find that turning static 3D objects into interactively openable counterparts is possible but that all methods struggle to generalize to realistic settings of the task, and we highlight promising future work directions. Our work enables efficient creation of interactive 3D objects for robotic manipulation and embodied AI tasks.</p></details> |  |

Many navigation approaches primarily define success by proximity to the target, often overlooking the necessity for optimal positioning that facilitates subsequent manipulation. To address this, we introduce MoMa-Kitchen, a benchmark dataset comprising over 100k samples that provide training data for models to learn optimal final navigation positions for seamless transition to manipulation. Our dataset includes affordance-grounded floor labels collected from diverse kitchen environments, in which robotic mobile manipulators of different models attempt to grasp target objects amidst clutter. Using a fully automated pipeline, we simulate diverse real-world scenarios and generate affordance labels for optimal manipulation positions. Visual data are collected from RGB-D inputs captured by a first-person view camera mounted on the robotic arm, ensuring consistency in viewpoint during data collection. We also develop a lightweight baseline model, NavAff, for navigation affordance grounding that demonstrates promising performance on the MoMa-Kitchen benchmark. Our approach enables models to learn affordance-based final positioning that accommodates different arm types and platform heights, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable integration of navigation and manipulation in embodied AI.

Recognizing continuous video activities poses considerable challenges due to the fast expansion of streaming video, which contains multi-scale and untrimmed activities. We introduce a novel system, CARS, to overcome these issues through adaptive video context modeling. Adaptive video context modeling refers to selectively maintaining activity-related features in temporal and spatial dimensions. CARS has two key designs. The first is an activity spatial feature extraction by eliminating irrelevant visual features while maintaining recognition accuracy. The second is an activity-aware state update introducing dynamic adaptability to better preserve the video context for multi-scale activity recognition. Our CARS runs at speeds $>$30 FPS on typical edge devices and outperforms all baselines by 1.2\% to 79.7\% in accuracy. Moreover, we explore applying CARS to a large video model as a video encoder. Experimental results show that our CARS can result in a 0.46-point enhancement (on a 5-point scale) on the in-distribution video activity dataset, and an improvement ranging from 1.19\% to 4\% on zero-shot video activity datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Long-horizon Embodied Planning with Implicit Logical Inference and Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15658v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon embodied planning underpins embodied AI. To accomplish long-horizon tasks, one of the most feasible ways is to decompose abstract instructions into a sequence of actionable steps. Foundation models still face logical errors and hallucinations in long-horizon planning, unless provided with highly relevant examples to the tasks. However, providing highly relevant examples for any random task is unpractical. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a novel framework for Real-time Long-horizon Embodied Planning. ReLEP can complete a wide range of long-horizon tasks without in-context examples by learning implicit logical inference through fine-tuning. The fine-tuned large vision-language model formulates plans as sequences of skill functions. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. When constructing the dataset, we considered the implicit logical relationships, enabling the model to learn implicit logical relationships and dispel hallucinations. Through comprehensive evaluations across various long-horizon tasks, ReLEP demonstrates high success rates and compliance to execution even on unseen tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

The high cost of commercial mobile manipulation robots significantly limits research in real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose AhaRobot, a low-cost and fully open-source dual-arm mobile manipulation robot system with a hardware cost of only $1,000 (excluding optional computational resources), which is less than 1/15 of the cost of popular mobile robots. The AhaRobot system consists of three components: (1) a novel low-cost hardware architecture primarily composed of off-the-shelf components, (2) an optimized control solution to enhance operational precision integrating dual-motor backlash control and static friction compensation, and (3) a simple remote teleoperation method RoboPilot. We use handles to control the dual arms and pedals for whole-body movement. The teleoperation process is low-burden and easy to operate, much like piloting. RoboPilot is designed for remote data collection in embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboPilot significantly enhances data collection efficiency in complex manipulation tasks, achieving a 30% increase compared to methods using 3D mouse and leader-follower systems. It also excels at completing extremely long-horizon tasks in one go. Furthermore, AhaRobot can be used to learn end-to-end policies and autonomously perform complex manipulation tasks, such as pen insertion and cleaning up the floor. We aim to build an affordable yet powerful platform to promote the development of embodied tasks on real devices, advancing more robust and reliable embodied AI.

Current screen based chat-bots do not take advantage of the the full-suite of natural inputs available in XR, including inward facing sensor data, instead they over-rely on explicit voice or text prompts, sometimes paired with multi-modal data dropped as part of the query.

Our work minimizes the need for engineered explicit prompts, fostering grounded and intuitive interactions that glean user insights for the chat-bot.</p></details> |  |

The system leverages multiple RGBD cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |

Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks. To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Interactive systems assist humans in these tasks, enabling applications in Embodied AI, human-robot interaction, and virtual reality. However, current methods in hand-object synthesis often neglect dynamics and focus on generating static grasps. The first part of this dissertation introduces dynamic grasp synthesis, where a hand grasps and moves an object to a target pose. We approach this task using physical simulation and reinforcement learning. We then extend this to bimanual manipulation and articulated objects, requiring fine-grained coordination between hands. In the second part of this dissertation, we study human-to-robot handovers. We integrate captured human motion into simulation and introduce a student-teacher framework that adapts to human behavior and transfers from sim to real. To overcome data scarcity, we generate synthetic interactions, increasing training diversity by 100x. Our user study finds no difference between policies trained on synthetic vs. real motions.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |

However, real-world datasets often lack sufficient data for training and evaluation, and synthetic datasets, while larger, lack acoustic realism. Consequently, neither effectively meets practical needs. To address this issue, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit based on the embodied AI simulation platform Habitat-sim, designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim supports multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level adjustments, enabling the creation of more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a benchmark dataset called SonicSet, utilizing LibriSpeech, Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K), Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to investigate the differences between synthetic and real-world data, we selected 5 hours of raw, non-reverberant data from the SonicSet validation set and recorded a real-world speech separation dataset, providing a reference for comparing SonicSet with other synthetic datasets. For speech enhancement, we utilized the real-world dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between SonicSet and existing synthetic datasets. The results indicate that models trained on SonicSet generalize better to real-world scenarios compared to other synthetic datasets.

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI.

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization.

Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development.

Affordance indicates where and how to grasp an object by taking its functionality into account, serving as the foundation for effective task-oriented grasping. However, current task-oriented methods often depend on extensive training data that is confined to specific tasks and objects, making it difficult to generalize to novel objects and complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce AffordGrasp, a novel open-vocabulary grasping framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) for in-context affordance reasoning. Unlike existing methods that rely on explicit task and object specifications, our approach infers tasks directly from implicit user instructions, enabling more intuitive and seamless human-robot interaction in everyday scenarios. Building on the reasoning outcomes, our framework identifies task-relevant objects and grounds their part-level affordances using a visual grounding module. This allows us to generate task-oriented grasp poses precisely within the affordance regions of the object, ensuring both functional and context-aware robotic manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. We believe our approach advances robotic manipulation techniques and contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://eqcy.github.io/affordgrasp/.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of prior magical grasp implementations at a fraction of the GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |

These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Pattern Recognition Letters.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, when powered by open LLMs, they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a multicomponent memory system. In Minecraft experiments, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks where traditional Voyager fails without GPT-4, collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items and achieving $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones, advancing from basic wood tools to advanced iron equipment. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated collaborative experiences. MindForge advances the democratization of embodied AI development through open-ended social learning, enabling peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.</p></details> |  |

Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |

Recent advances in foundation models pave the way for generative agents capable of richer communication and adaptive problem-solving. This survey provides a systematic examination of how EMAS can benefit from these generative capabilities. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes EMAS by system architectures and embodiment modalities, emphasizing how collaboration spans both physical and virtual contexts. Central building blocks, perception, planning, communication, and feedback, are then analyzed to illustrate how generative techniques bolster system robustness and flexibility. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the transformative effects of integrating foundation models into embodied, multi-agent frameworks. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions, underlining the significant promise of EMAS to reshape the landscape of AI-driven collaboration.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We propose a novel object-centric latent action learning approach, based on VideoSaur and LAPO, that employs self-supervised decomposition of scenes into object representations and annotates video data with proxy-action labels. This method effectively disentangles causal agent-object interactions from irrelevant background noise and reduces the performance degradation of latent action learning approaches caused by distractors. Our preliminary experiments with the Distracting Control Suite show that latent action pretraining based on object decompositions improve the quality of inferred latent actions by x2.7 and efficiency of downstream fine-tuning with a small set of labeled actions, increasing return by x2.6 on average.</p></details> | Preprint.

However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |

Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets.

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |

This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

However, existing block propagation mechanisms suffer from challenges such as low propagation efficiency and weak security for block propagation, which results in delayed transmission of vehicular messages or vulnerability to malicious tampering, potentially causing severe traffic accidents in blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Moreover, current block propagation strategies cannot effectively adapt to real-time changes of dynamic topology in MEANETs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph Resfusion model-based trustworthy block propagation optimization framework for consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Specifically, we propose an innovative trust calculation mechanism based on the trust cloud model, which comprehensively accounts for randomness and fuzziness in the miner trust evaluation. Furthermore, by leveraging the strengths of graph neural networks and diffusion models, we develop a graph Resfusion model to effectively and adaptively generate the optimal block propagation trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other routing mechanisms in terms of block propagation efficiency and trustworthiness. Additionally, the results highlight its strong adaptability to dynamic environments, making it particularly suitable for rapidly changing MEANETs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</p></details> | Website: GenEx.world |

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

However, a standardized, closed-loop benchmark for evaluating their spatial reasoning and sequential decision-making capabilities is lacking. To address this, we present MetaVQA: a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess and enhance VLMs' understanding of spatial relationships and scene dynamics through Visual Question Answering (VQA) and closed-loop simulations. MetaVQA leverages Set-of-Mark prompting and top-down view ground-truth annotations from nuScenes and Waymo datasets to automatically generate extensive question-answer pairs based on diverse real-world traffic scenarios, ensuring object-centric and context-rich instructions. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with the MetaVQA dataset significantly improves their spatial reasoning and embodied scene comprehension in safety-critical simulations, evident not only in improved VQA accuracies but also in emerging safety-aware driving maneuvers. In addition, the learning demonstrates strong transferability from simulation to real-world observation.

However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks. This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context. Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior studies that explored this as long-form video understanding and utilized egocentric video only, we instead propose an LLM-based agent, Embodied VideoAgent, which constructs scene memory from both egocentric video and embodied sensory inputs (e.g. depth and pose sensing). We further introduce a VLM-based approach to automatically update the memory when actions or activities over objects are perceived. Embodied VideoAgent attains significant advantages over counterparts in challenging reasoning and planning tasks in 3D scenes, achieving gains of 4.9% on Ego4D-VQ3D, 5.8% on OpenEQA, and 11.7% on EnvQA.

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |

The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment.

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV.

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</p></details> |  |

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments.

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |

However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions.

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |

The central case study is Jess+ an intelligent digital score system for shared creativity with a mixed ensemble of non-disabled and disabled musicians. The overarching aim is that the digital score enables disabled musicians to thrive in a live music conversation with other musicians regardless of the potential barriers of disability and music-making. After defining what we mean by embodied AI and how this approach supports the aims of the Jess+ project, we outline the main design features of the system. This includes several novel approaches such as its modular design, an AI Factory based on an embodied musicking dataset, and an embedded belief system. Our findings showed that the implemented design decisions and embodied-AI approach led to rich experiences for the musicians which in turn transformed their practice as an inclusive ensemble.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models in Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07904v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated a wide range of capabilities across many domains, including Embodied AI. In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This study finds that state-of-the-art embodied AI agents compete for higher navigation quality, but often compromise the computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce "Skip-SCAR," an optimization framework that builds computationally and memory-efficient embodied AI agents to accomplish high-quality visual navigation tasks. Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint. Tested on the HM3D ObjectNav datasets and real-world physical hardware systems, Skip-SCAR not only minimizes hardware resources but also sets new performance benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of optimizing both navigation quality and computational efficiency for robotics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |

Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, these approaches often require task-specific demonstrations or designing complex simulation environments, which limits the development of generalizable and robust policies for unseen real-world settings. Recent advances in the use of foundation models for robotics (e.g., LLMs, VLMs) have shown great potential in enabling systems to understand the semantics in the world from large-scale internet data. However, it remains an open challenge to use this knowledge to enable robotic systems to understand the underlying dynamics of the world, to generalize policies across different tasks, and to adapt policies to new environments. To alleviate these limitations, we propose an agentic framework for robot self-guidance and self-improvement, which consists of a set of role-specialized conversational agents, such as a high-level advisor, a grounding agent, a monitoring agent, and a robotic agent. Our framework iteratively grounds a base robot policy to relevant objects in the environment and uses visuomotor cues to shift the action distribution of the policy to more desirable states, online, while remaining agnostic to the subjective configuration of a given robot hardware platform. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide manipulation policies to achieve significantly higher success rates, both in simulation and in real-world experiments, without the need for additional human demonstrations or extensive exploration.

Previous research efforts have explored the capabilities of MARL algorithms within Hanabi, focusing largely on advanced architecture design and algorithmic manipulations to achieve state-of-the-art performance for a various number of cooperators. However, this often leads to complex solution strategies with high computational cost and requiring large amounts of training data. For humans to solve the Hanabi game effectively, they require the use of conventions, which often allows for a means to implicitly convey ideas or knowledge based on a predefined, and mutually agreed upon, set of ``rules''. Multi-agent problems containing partial observability, especially when limited communication is present, can benefit greatly from the use of implicit knowledge sharing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to augmenting the action space using conventions, which act as special cooperative actions that span over multiple time steps and multiple agents, requiring agents to actively opt in for it to reach fruition. These conventions are based on existing human conventions, and result in a significant improvement on the performance of existing techniques for self-play and cross-play across a various number of cooperators within Hanabi.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review at the journal of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (JAAMAS).

| **[Adversarial Training of Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06141v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward modeling has emerged as a promising approach for the scalable alignment of language models. However, contemporary reward models (RMs) often lack robustness, awarding high rewards to low-quality, out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. This can lead to reward hacking, where policies exploit unintended shortcuts to maximize rewards, undermining alignment. To address this challenge, we introduce Adv-RM, a novel adversarial training framework that automatically identifies adversarial examples -- responses that receive high rewards from the target RM but are OOD and of low quality. By leveraging reinforcement learning, Adv-RM trains a policy to generate adversarial examples that reliably expose vulnerabilities in large state-of-the-art reward models such as Nemotron 340B RM. Incorporating these adversarial examples into the reward training process improves the robustness of RMs, mitigating reward hacking and enhancing downstream performance in RLHF. We demonstrate that Adv-RM significantly outperforms conventional RM training, increasing stability and enabling more effective RLHF training in both synthetic and real-data settings.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Multimedia Analytics Model for the Foundation Model Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06138v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advances in Foundation Models and agentic Artificial Intelligence are transforming multimedia analytics by enabling richer, more sophisticated interactions between humans and analytical systems. Existing conceptual models for visual and multimedia analytics, however, do not adequately capture the complexity introduced by these powerful AI paradigms. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive multimedia analytics model specifically designed for the foundation model era. Building upon established frameworks from visual analytics, multimedia analytics, knowledge generation, analytic task definition, mixed-initiative guidance, and human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning, our model emphasizes integrated human-AI teaming based on visual analytics agents from both technical and conceptual perspectives. Central to the model is a seamless, yet explicitly separable, interaction channel between expert users and semi-autonomous analytical processes, ensuring continuous alignment between user intent and AI behavior. The model addresses practical challenges in sensitive domains such as intelligence analysis, investigative journalism, and other fields handling complex, high-stakes data. We illustrate through detailed case studies how our model facilitates deeper understanding and targeted improvement of multimedia analytics solutions. By explicitly capturing how expert users can optimally interact with and guide AI-powered multimedia analytics systems, our conceptual framework sets a clear direction for system design, comparison, and future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Vehicle Routing via AI-Initialized Genetic Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06126v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) are an extension of the Traveling Salesperson Problem and are a fundamental NP-hard challenge in combinatorial optimization. Solving VRP in real-time at large scale has become critical in numerous applications, from growing markets like last-mile delivery to emerging use-cases like interactive logistics planning. Such applications involve solving similar problem instances repeatedly, yet current state-of-the-art solvers treat each instance on its own without leveraging previous examples. We introduce a novel optimization framework that uses a reinforcement learning agent - trained on prior instances - to quickly generate initial solutions, which are then further optimized by genetic algorithms. Our framework, Evolutionary Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning Initialization (EARLI), consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art solvers across various time scales. For example, EARLI handles vehicle routing with 500 locations within 1s, 10x faster than current solvers for the same solution quality, enabling applications like real-time and interactive routing. EARLI can generalize to new data, as demonstrated on real e-commerce delivery data of a previously unseen city. Our hybrid framework presents a new way to combine reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms, paving the road for closer interdisciplinary collaboration between AI and optimization communities towards real-time optimization in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

However, orchestrating these systems at scale remains a critical challenge, with existing coordination algorithms often failing to exploit the systems' full potential. This work introduces a novel decision-making framework that unites mathematical modeling with data-driven techniques. In particular, we present the AMoD coordination problem through the lens of reinforcement learning and propose a graph network-based framework that exploits the main strengths of graph representation learning, reinforcement learning, and classical operations research tools. Extensive evaluations across diverse simulation fidelities and scenarios demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, achieving superior system performance, computational efficiency, and generalizability compared to prior methods. Finally, motivated by the need to democratize research efforts in this area, we release publicly available benchmarks, datasets, and simulators for network-level coordination alongside an open-source codebase designed to provide accessible simulation platforms and establish a standardized validation process for comparing methodologies.

| **[Unraveling Arithmetic in Large Language Models: The Role of Algebraic Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16260v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have improved with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, allowing models to solve complex tasks stepwise. However, training CoT capabilities requires detailed reasoning data, which is often scarce. The self-taught reasoner (STaR) framework addresses this by using reinforcement learning to automatically generate reasoning steps, reducing reliance on human-labeled data. Although STaR and its variants have demonstrated empirical success, a theoretical foundation explaining these improvements is lacking. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable mathematical capabilities, largely driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which decomposes complex reasoning into step-by-step solutions. However, the mechanisms underlying LLMs' ability to perform arithmetic in a single step of CoT remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose that LLMs learn arithmetic by capturing algebraic structures, such as commutativity and identity properties. Since these structures are observable through input-output relationships, they can generalize to unseen data. We empirically demonstrate that LLMs can learn algebraic structures using a custom dataset of arithmetic problems, as well as providing theoretical evidence showing that, under specific configurations of weights and biases, the transformer-based LLMs can generate embeddings that remain invariant to both permutations of input tokens and the presence of identity elements. Our findings indicate that leveraging algebraic structures can enhance the LLMs' arithmetic capabilities, offering insights into improving their arithmetic performance.</p></details> |  |

However, ATP has not yet be revolutionized by the recent posttraining scaling as demonstrated by Open AI O1/O3 and Deepseek R1. In this work, we investigate the entire posttraining of ATP, aiming to align it with breakthroughs in reasoning models in natural languages.To begin, we continual train current ATP models with a hybrid dataset, which consists of numerous statement-proof pairs, and additional data aimed at incorporating cognitive behaviors that emulate human reasoning and hypothesis refinement. Next, we explore reinforcement learning with the use of outcome reward returned by Lean 4 compiler. Through our designed continual training and reinforcement learning processes, we have successfully improved existing formal provers, including both DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5 and Goedel-Prover, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of whole-proof generation. For example, we achieve a 59.8% pass rate (pass@32) on MiniF2F. This is an on-going project and we will progressively update our findings, release our data and training details.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning frameworks where the LLM learns to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 41% (Qwen2.5-7B) and 20% (Qwen2.5-3B) over various RAG baselines under the same setting. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

However, scaling MCTS to parallel compute has proven challenging in practice which has motivated alternative planners like sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC). Many of these SMC methods adopt particle filters for smoothing through a reformulation of RL as a policy inference problem. Yet, persisting design choices of these particle filters often conflict with the aim of online planning in RL, which is to obtain a policy improvement at the start of planning. Drawing inspiration from MCTS, we tailor SMC planners specifically for RL by improving data generation within the planner through constrained action sampling and explicit terminal state handling, as well as improving policy and value target estimation. This leads to our Trust-Region Twisted SMC (TRT-SMC), which shows improved runtime and sample-efficiency over baseline MCTS and SMC methods in both discrete and continuous domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information-Theoretic Reward Decomposition for Generalizable RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06020v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A generalizable reward model is crucial in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) as it enables correctly evaluating unseen prompt-response pairs. However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done during internships at Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom</p></details> |

Building upon the foundation laid by [1], we extend their work to address the non-preemptive scheduling problem, which is known to be NP-hard. By modeling this scheduling challenge as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we develop an RL agent capable of generating near-optimal schedules for real-time MC systems. Our RL-based scheduler prioritizes high-critical tasks while maintaining overall system performance. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The RL scheduler significantly improves task completion rates, achieving around 80% overall and 85% for high-criticality tasks across 100,000 instances of synthetic data and real data under varying system conditions. Moreover, under stable conditions without degradation, the scheduler achieves 94% overall task completion and 93% for high-criticality tasks. These results highlight the potential of RL-based schedulers in real-time and safety-critical applications, offering substantial improvements in handling complex and dynamic scheduling scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was submitted to the 32nd International Conference on Real-Time Networks and Systems (RTNS) on June 8, 2024</p></details> |

We propose using prior model knowledge to guide the exploration process to speed up this learning process. This model knowledge comes in the form of a model set to which the true transition kernel and reward function belong. We optimize over this model set to obtain upper and lower bounds on the Q-function, which are then used to guide the exploration of the agent. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the Q-function to the optimal Q-function under the proposed class of exploring policies. Furthermore, we also introduce a data-driven regularized version of the model set optimization problem that ensures the convergence of the class of exploring policies to the optimal policy. Lastly, we show that when the model set has a specific structure, namely the bounded-parameter MDP (BMDP) framework, the regularized model set optimization problem becomes convex and simple to implement. In this setting, we also show that we obtain finite-time convergence to the optimal policy under additional assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed exploration strategy in a simulation study. The results indicate that the proposed method can significantly speed up the learning process in reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication</p></details> |

Predicting KOA progression is crucial for improving patient outcomes, optimizing healthcare resources, studying the disease, and developing new treatments. The latter application particularly requires one to understand the disease progression in order to collect the most informative data at the right time. Existing methods, however, are limited by their static nature and their focus on individual joints, leading to suboptimal predictive performance and downstream utility. Our study proposes a new method that allows to dynamically monitor patients rather than individual joints with KOA using a novel Active Sensing (AS) approach powered by Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our key idea is to directly optimize for the downstream task by training an agent that maximizes informative data collection while minimizing overall costs. Our RL-based method leverages a specially designed reward function to monitor disease progression across multiple body parts, employs multimodal deep learning, and requires no human input during testing. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art models, paving the way for the next generation of KOA trials.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements, training machines to capture regions of interest for comprehensive scene understanding, like human perception and reasoning, remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel framework, Human Attention-based Explainable Guidance for Intelligent Vehicle Systems (AEGIS). AEGIS utilizes human attention, converted from eye-tracking, to guide reinforcement learning (RL) models to identify critical regions of interest for decision-making. AEGIS uses a pre-trained human attention model to guide RL models to identify critical regions of interest for decision-making. By collecting 1.2 million frames from 20 participants across six scenarios, AEGIS pre-trains a model to predict human attention patterns.</p></details> |  |

Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are preferred for navigating in these complex, GPS-denied scenarios because of their agility, low power consumption, and limited computational capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning based Deep-Proximal Policy Optimization (D-PPO) algorithm to enhance realtime navigation through improving the computation efficiency. The end-to-end network is trained in 3D realistic meta-environments created using the Unreal Engine. With these trained meta-weights, the MAV system underwent extensive experimental trials in real-world indoor environments. The results indicate that the proposed method reduces computational latency by 91\% during training period without significant degradation in performance. The algorithm was tested on a DJI Tello drone, yielding similar results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization: Balancing Safety-Helpfulness in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15313v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on human preferences, typically through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has proven successful in enhancing their capabilities. However, ensuring the safety of LLMs during fine-tuning remains a critical concern, and mitigating the potential conflicts in safety and helpfulness is costly in RLHF. To address this issue, we propose a supervised learning framework called Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization (BFPO), which re-parameterizes a joint RLHF objective of both safety and helpfulness into a single supervised learning objective. In supervised optimization, a labeling function is used to capture the global preferences ranking to balance both safety and helpfulness. To evaluate BFPO, we develop a benchmark that includes comprehensive discriminative and generative tasks for helpfulness and harmlessness. The results indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both safety and helpfulness.

| **[Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model: A Natural Generalization of Bradley-Terry Reward Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22480v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a critical technique for training large language models. However, reward hacking-a phenomenon where models exploit flaws in the reward model-remains a significant barrier to achieving robust and scalable intelligence through long-term training. Existing studies have proposed uncertain reward model to address reward hacking, however, they often lack systematic or theoretical foundations, failing to model the uncertainty intrinsically emerging from preference data, thus cannot sufficiently mitigate reward hacking to sustain prolonged RLHF training and exploration. In this paper, we propose the Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model (PURM), a natural generalization of the classical Bradley-Terry reward model, that directly model the reward distribution emerged from the preference data. We theoretically derived PURM's loss function and the reward distribution uncertainty calculation based on Bhattacharyya Coefficient. To mitigate reward hacking with PURM, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware penalty into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which leverages the learned uncertainty to dynamically balance reward optimization and exploration. We propose a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of PURM. Experiments demonstrate that PURM significantly delays the onset of reward hacking while improving final reward performance, outperforming baseline methods in both stability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, this is not the case with most real-world applications like autonomous driving or in nature where animals roam. Some experiences are encountered frequently, and most of the remaining experiences occur rarely; the resulting distribution is called Zipfian. Taking inspiration from the theory of complementary learning systems, an architecture for learning from Zipfian distributions is proposed where important long tail trajectories are discovered in an unsupervised manner. The proposal comprises an episodic memory buffer containing a prioritised memory module to ensure important rare trajectories are kept longer to address the Zipfian problem, which needs credit assignment to happen in a sample efficient manner. The experiences are then reinstated from episodic memory and given weighted importance forming the trajectory to be executed. Notably, the proposed architecture is modular, can be incorporated in any RL architecture and yields improved performance in multiple Zipfian tasks over traditional architectures. Our method outperforms IMPALA by a significant margin on all three tasks and all three evaluation metrics (Zipfian, Uniform, and Rare Accuracy) and also gives improvements on most Atari environments that are considered challenging</p></details> |  |

However, these approaches critically depend on external supervisions--such as human labelled reasoning traces, verified golden answers, or pre-trained reward models--which limits scalability and practical applicability. In this work, we propose Entropy Minimized Policy Optimization (EMPO), which makes an early attempt at fully unsupervised LLM reasoning incentivization. EMPO does not require any supervised information for incentivizing reasoning capabilities (i.e., neither verifiable reasoning traces, problems with golden answers, nor additional pre-trained reward models). By continuously minimizing the predictive entropy of LLMs on unlabeled user queries in a latent semantic space, EMPO enables purely self-supervised evolution of reasoning capabilities with strong flexibility and practicality. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance of EMPO on both mathematical reasoning and free-form commonsense reasoning tasks. Specifically, without any supervised signals, EMPO boosts the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Math-7B Base from 30.7\% to 48.1\% on mathematical benchmarks and improves truthfulness accuracy of Qwen2.5-7B Instruct from 87.16\% to 97.25\% on TruthfulQA.</p></details> | Ongoing work |

However, accumulated model errors during these rollouts can distort the data distribution, negatively impacting policy learning and hindering long-term planning. Thus, the accumulation of model errors is a key bottleneck in current MBRL methods. We propose Infoprop, a model-based rollout mechanism that separates aleatoric from epistemic model uncertainty and reduces the influence of the latter on the data distribution. Further, Infoprop keeps track of accumulated model errors along a model rollout and provides termination criteria to limit data corruption. We demonstrate the capabilities of Infoprop in the Infoprop-Dyna algorithm, reporting state-of-the-art performance in Dyna-style MBRL on common MuJoCo benchmark tasks while substantially increasing rollout length and data quality.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, a range of crucial robotics-related tasks, such as multi-robot pathfinding, which have traditionally been approached with classical non-learnable methods (e.g., heuristic search), are now being suggested for solution using learning-based or hybrid methods. However, in this domain, it remains difficult, if not impossible, to conduct a fair comparison between classical, learning-based, and hybrid approaches due to the lack of a unified framework that supports both learning and evaluation. To address this, we introduce POGEMA, a comprehensive set of tools that includes a fast environment for learning, a problem instance generator, a collection of predefined problem instances, a visualization toolkit, and a benchmarking tool for automated evaluation. We also introduce and define an evaluation protocol that specifies a range of domain-related metrics, computed based on primary evaluation indicators (such as success rate and path length), enabling a fair multi-fold comparison. The results of this comparison, which involves a variety of state-of-the-art MARL, search-based, and hybrid methods, are presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at The International Conference on Learning Representations 2025</p></details> |

Solving MAPF optimally, even under restrictive assumptions, is NP-hard, yet efficient solutions for this problem are critical for numerous applications, such as automated warehouses and transportation systems. Recently, learning-based approaches to MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep reinforcement learning. Typically, such learning-based MAPF solvers are augmented with additional components like single-agent planning or communication. Orthogonally, in this work we rely solely on imitation learning that leverages a large dataset of expert MAPF solutions and transformer-based neural network to create a foundation model for MAPF called MAPF-GPT. The latter is capable of generating actions without additional heuristics or communication. MAPF-GPT demonstrates zero-shot learning abilities when solving the MAPF problems that are not present in the training dataset. We show that MAPF-GPT notably outperforms the current best-performing learnable MAPF solvers on a diverse range of problem instances and is computationally efficient during inference.</p></details> |  |

Both processes demand an intricate understanding of advanced technical domain knowledge. Existing large language models (LLMs), while possessing massive pre-trained knowledge, often fall short in the innovative concept generation due to a lack of specialized knowledge necessary for the generation. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a novel knowledge finetuning (KFT) framework to endow LLM-based AI with the ability to autonomously mine, understand, and apply domain-specific knowledge and concepts for invention generation, i.e., concept and patent generation together. Our proposed PatentGPT integrates knowledge injection pre-training (KPT), domain-specific supervised finetuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Extensive evaluation shows that PatentGPT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models on patent-related benchmark tests. Our method not only provides new insights into data-driven innovation but also paves a new path to fine-tune LLMs for applications in the context of technology. We also discuss the managerial and policy implications of AI-generating inventions in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Advanced Engineering Informatics, Link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2025.103301</p></details> |

A typical recommender system handling multiple types of feedback has two components: a multi-task learning (MTL) module, predicting feedback such as click-through rate and like rate; and a multi-task fusion (MTF) module, integrating these predictions into a single score for item ranking. MTF is essential for ensuring user satisfaction, as it directly influences recommendation outcomes. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to MTF tasks to improve long-term user satisfaction. However, existing RL-based MTF methods are formula-based methods, which only adjust limited coefficients within pre-defined formulas. The pre-defined formulas restrict the RL search space and become a bottleneck for MTF. To overcome this, we propose a formula-free MTF framework. We demonstrate that any suitable fusion function can be expressed as a composition of single-variable monotonic functions, as per the Sprecher Representation Theorem. Leveraging this, we introduce a novel learnable monotonic fusion cell (MFC) to replace pre-defined formulas. We call this new MFC-based model eXtreme MTF (xMTF). Furthermore, we employ a two-stage hybrid (TSH) learning strategy to train xMTF effectively. By expanding the MTF search space, xMTF outperforms existing methods in extensive offline and online experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figues; WWW 2025 Accepted</p></details> |

The use of hyperproperties is motivated by their significant power to formally specify requirements of multi-agent systems as well as those that need expressiveness in terms of multiple execution traces (e.g., privacy and fairness). Given a Markov decision process M with unknown transitions (representing the environment) and a HyperLTL formula $\varphi$, our approach first employs Skolemization to handle quantifier alternations in $\varphi$. We introduce quantitative robustness functions for HyperLTL to define rewards of finite traces of M with respect to $\varphi$. Finally, we utilize a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm to learn (1) a policy per trace quantifier in $\varphi$, and (2) the probability distribution of transitions of M that together maximize the expected reward and, hence, probability of satisfaction of $\varphi$ in M. We present a set of case studies on (1) safety-preserving multi-agent path planning, (2) fairness in resource allocation, and (3) the post-correspondence problem (PCP).</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in evaluating and enhancing multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Focusing on task-specific scenarios, from instruction following in diverse domains such as math and coding to complex conversational engagements in roleplay, healthcare, education, and even adversarial jailbreak settings, we systematically examine the challenges of maintaining context, coherence, fairness, and responsiveness over prolonged dialogues. The paper organizes current benchmarks and datasets into coherent categories that reflect the evolving landscape of multi-turn dialogue evaluation. In addition, we review a range of enhancement methodologies under multi-turn settings, including model-centric strategies (contextual learning, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and new architectures), external integration approaches (memory-augmented, retrieval-based methods, and knowledge graph), and agent-based techniques for collaborative interactions. Finally, we discuss open challenges and propose future directions for research to further advance the robustness and effectiveness of multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Related resources and papers are available at https://github.com/yubol-cmu/Awesome-Multi-Turn-LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of RL in social reasoning, particularly in Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' mental states, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that RL methods effectively unlock ToM reasoning capabilities even in small-scale LLMs (0.5B to 7B parameters). Using a modest dataset comprising 3200 questions across diverse scenarios, our RL-trained 7B model achieves 84.50\% accuracy on the Hi-ToM benchmark, surpassing models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-v3 despite significantly fewer parameters. While smaller models ($\leq$3B parameters) suffer from reasoning collapse, larger models (7B parameters) maintain stable performance through consistent belief tracking. Additionally, our RL-based models demonstrate robust generalization to higher-order, out-of-distribution ToM problems, novel textual presentations, and previously unseen datasets. These findings highlight RL's potential to enhance social cognitive reasoning, bridging the gap between structured problem-solving and nuanced social inference in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Although traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been shown to be promising, their effectiveness is hindered by a reliance on manually designed reward functions and inefficiencies in dynamic environments. In this paper, an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework is proposed, in which multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and graph attention mechanisms are incorporated to enhance reward function learning and task execution efficiency. Expert demonstrations are utilized to infer optimal reward densities, allowing dependence on handcrafted designs to be reduced and adaptability to be improved. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method over widely used multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in terms of both cumulative rewards and task execution efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added a clarification on the source of expert trajectories in Section V</p></details> |

However, not all of these start-ups have succeeded due to various reasons, among others, not being able to establish a large enough customer base. In this paper, we address this problem that many on-demand transportation start-ups face: how to establish themselves in a new market. When starting, such companies often have limited fleet resources to serve demand across a city. Depending on the use of the fleet, varying service quality is observed in different areas of the city, and in turn, the service quality impacts the respective growth of demand in each area. Thus, operational fulfillment decisions drive the longer-term demand development. To integrate strategic demand development into real-time fulfillment operations, we propose a two-step approach. First, we derive analytical insights into optimal allocation decisions for a stylized problem. Second, we use these insights to shape the training data of a reinforcement learning strategy for operational real-time fulfillment. Our experiments demonstrate that combining operational efficiency with long-term strategic planning is highly advantageous. Further, we show that the careful shaping of training data is essential for the successful development of demand.</p></details> |  |
| **[PTRL: Prior Transfer Deep Reinforcement Learning for Legged Robots Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05629v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of legged robot motion control, reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise but faces two major challenges: high computational cost for training individual robots and poor generalization of trained models. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel framework called Prior Transfer Reinforcement Learning (PTRL), which improves both training efficiency and model transferability across different robots. Drawing inspiration from model transfer techniques in deep learning, PTRL introduces a fine-tuning mechanism that selectively freezes layers of the policy network during transfer, making it the first to apply such a method in RL. The framework consists of three stages: pre-training on a source robot using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, transferring the learned policy to a target robot, and fine-tuning with partial network freezing. Extensive experiments on various robot platforms confirm that this approach significantly reduces training time while maintaining or even improving performance. Moreover, the study quantitatively analyzes how the ratio of frozen layers affects transfer results, providing valuable insights into optimizing the process. The experimental outcomes show that PTRL achieves better walking control performance and demonstrates strong generalization and adaptability, offering a promising solution for efficient and scalable RL-based control of legged robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stratified Expert Cloning with Adaptive Selection for User Retention in Large-Scale Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05628v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User retention has emerged as a critical challenge in large-scale recommender systems, significantly impacting the long-term success of online platforms. Existing methods often focus on short-term engagement metrics, failing to capture the complex dynamics of user preferences and behaviors over extended periods. While reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have shown promise in optimizing long-term rewards, they face difficulties in credit assignment, sample efficiency, and exploration when applied to the user retention problem. In this work, we propose Stratified Expert Cloning (SEC), a novel imitation learning framework that effectively leverages abundant logged data from high-retention users to learn robust recommendation policies. SEC introduces three key innovations: 1) a multi-level expert stratification strategy that captures the nuances in expert user behaviors at different retention levels; 2) an adaptive expert selection mechanism that dynamically assigns users to the most suitable policy based on their current state and historical retention level; and 3) an action entropy regularization technique that promotes recommendation diversity and mitigates the risk of policy collapse. Through extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests on two major video platforms, Kuaishou and Kuaishou Lite, with hundreds of millions of daily active users, we demonstrate SEC's significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in user retention. The results demonstrate significant improvements in user retention, with cumulative lifts of 0.098\% and 0.122\% in active days on Kuaishou and Kuaishou Lite respectively, additionally bringing tens of thousands of daily active users to each platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Benchmarked the AIME 2024 dataset, VAPO, built on the Qwen 32B pre-trained model, attains a state-of-the-art score of $\mathbf{60.4}$. In direct comparison under identical experimental settings, VAPO outperforms the previously reported results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B and DAPO by more than 10 points. The training process of VAPO stands out for its stability and efficiency. It reaches state-of-the-art performance within a mere 5,000 steps. Moreover, across multiple independent runs, no training crashes occur, underscoring its reliability. This research delves into long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) reasoning using a value-based reinforcement learning framework. We pinpoint three key challenges that plague value-based methods: value model bias, the presence of heterogeneous sequence lengths, and the sparsity of reward signals. Through systematic design, VAPO offers an integrated solution that effectively alleviates these challenges, enabling enhanced performance in long-CoT reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present ShadowCoT, a novel backdoor attack framework that targets the internal reasoning mechanism of LLMs. Unlike prior token-level or prompt-based attacks, ShadowCoT directly manipulates the model's cognitive reasoning path, enabling it to hijack multi-step reasoning chains and produce logically coherent but adversarial outcomes. By conditioning on internal reasoning states, ShadowCoT learns to recognize and selectively disrupt key reasoning steps, effectively mounting a self-reflective cognitive attack within the target model. Our approach introduces a lightweight yet effective multi-stage injection pipeline, which selectively rewires attention pathways and perturbs intermediate representations with minimal parameter overhead (only 0.15% updated). ShadowCoT further leverages reinforcement learning and reasoning chain pollution (RCP) to autonomously synthesize stealthy adversarial CoTs that remain undetectable to advanced defenses. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks and LLMs show that ShadowCoT consistently achieves high Attack Success Rate (94.4%) and Hijacking Success Rate (88.4%) while preserving benign performance. These results reveal an emergent class of cognition-level threats and highlight the urgent need for defenses beyond shallow surface-level consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Zhao ...</summary><p>Zhao et al., 16 pages, 2025, uploaded by Hanzhou Wu, Shanghai University</p></details> |

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has seen promising results for applications in different scientific applications. The many-query nature of control tasks requires multiple interactions with real environments of the underlying physics. However, it is usually sparse to collect from the experiments or expensive to simulate for complex dynamics. Alternatively, controlling surrogate modeling could mitigate the computational cost issue. However, a fast and accurate learning-based model by offline training makes it very hard to get accurate pointwise dynamics when the dynamics are chaotic. To bridge this gap, the current work proposes a multi-fidelity reinforcement learning (MFRL) framework that leverages differentiable hybrid models for control tasks, where a physics-based hybrid model is corrected by limited high-fidelity data. We also proposed a spectrum-based reward function for RL learning. The effect of the proposed framework is demonstrated on two complex dynamics in physics. The statistics of the MFRL control result match that computed from many-query evaluations of the high-fidelity environments and outperform other SOTA baselines.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, these tasks often feature hidden "trap states" -- irreversible failures that prevent task completion but do not provide explicit negative rewards to guide agents away from repeated errors. To address these issues, we propose Time-Weighted Contrastive Reward Learning (TW-CRL), an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that leverages both successful and failed demonstrations. By incorporating temporal information, TW-CRL learns a dense reward function that identifies critical states associated with success or failure. This approach not only enables agents to avoid trap states but also encourages meaningful exploration beyond simple imitation of expert trajectories. Empirical evaluations on navigation tasks and robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that TW-CRL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving improved efficiency and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Sub-Optimal Data for Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00746v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To create useful reinforcement learning (RL) agents, step zero is to design a suitable reward function that captures the nuances of the task. However, reward engineering can be a difficult and time-consuming process. Instead, human-in-the-loop RL methods hold the promise of learning reward functions from human feedback. Despite recent successes, many of the human-in-the-loop RL methods still require numerous human interactions to learn successful reward functions. To improve the feedback efficiency of human-in-the-loop RL methods (i.e., require less human interaction), this paper introduces Sub-optimal Data Pre-training, SDP, an approach that leverages reward-free, sub-optimal data to improve scalar- and preference-based RL algorithms. In SDP, we start by pseudo-labeling all low-quality data with the minimum environment reward. Through this process, we obtain reward labels to pre-train our reward model without requiring human labeling or preferences. This pre-training phase provides the reward model a head start in learning, enabling it to recognize that low-quality transitions should be assigned low rewards. Through extensive experiments with both simulated and human teachers, we find that SDP can at least meet, but often significantly improve, state of the art human-in-the-loop RL performance across a variety of simulated robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05553v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC), enabling multiple intersections to coordinate signal timings in real time. However, in large-scale settings, MARL faces constraints due to extensive data sharing and communication requirements. Federated learning (FL) mitigates these challenges by training shared models without directly exchanging raw data, yet traditional FL methods such as FedAvg struggle with highly heterogeneous intersections. Different intersections exhibit varying traffic patterns, demands, and road structures, so performing FedAvg across all agents is inefficient. To address this gap, we propose Hierarchical Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL) for ATSC. HFRL employs clustering-based or optimization-based techniques to dynamically group intersections and perform FedAvg independently within groups of intersections with similar characteristics, enabling more effective coordination and scalability than standard FedAvg. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world traffic networks demonstrate that HFRL not only outperforms both decentralized and standard federated RL approaches but also identifies suitable grouping patterns based on network structure or traffic demand, resulting in a more robust framework for distributed, heterogeneous systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Option Hedging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05521v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic hedging is a financial strategy that consists in periodically transacting one or multiple financial assets to offset the risk associated with a correlated liability. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have been used to find optimal solutions to dynamic hedging problems by framing them as sequential decision-making problems. However, most previous work assesses the performance of only one or two DRL algorithms, making an objective comparison across algorithms difficult. In this paper, we compare the performance of eight DRL algorithms in the context of dynamic hedging; Monte Carlo Policy Gradient (MCPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), along with four variants of Deep Q-Learning (DQL) and two variants of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Two of these variants represent a novel application to the task of dynamic hedging. In our experiments, we use the Black-Scholes delta hedge as a baseline and simulate the dataset using a GJR-GARCH(1,1) model. Results show that MCPG, followed by PPO, obtain the best performance in terms of the root semi-quadratic penalty. Moreover, MCPG is the only algorithm to outperform the Black-Scholes delta hedge baseline with the allotted computational budget, possibly due to the sparsity of rewards in our environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Faster Reinforcement Learning by Freezing Slow States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00922v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study infinite horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with "fast-slow" structure, where some state variables evolve rapidly ("fast states") while others change more gradually ("slow states"). Such structure is common in real-world problems where sequential decisions need to be made at high frequencies over long horizons, where slowly evolving information also influences optimal decisions. Examples include inventory control under slowly changing demand, or dynamic pricing with gradually shifting consumer behavior. Modeling the problem at the natural decision frequency leads to MDPs with discount factors close to one, making them computationally challenging. We propose a novel approximation strategy that "freezes" slow states during a phase of lower-level planning, solving finite-horizon MDPs conditioned on a fixed slow state, and then applying value iteration to an auxiliary upper-level MDP that evolves on a slower timescale. Freezing states for short periods of time leads to easier-to-solve lower-level problems, while a slower upper-level timescale allows for a more favorable discount factor. On the theoretical side, we analyze the regret incurred by our frozen-state approach, which leads to simple insights on how to trade off computational budget versus regret. Empirically, we demonstrate that frozen-state methods produce high-quality policies with significantly less computation, and we show that simply omitting slow states is often a poor heuristic.</p></details> | 66 pages, 10 figures |

These unique characteristics of LLMs, together with their large model size, make their deployment more challenging. Specifically, (i) deploying LLMs on local devices faces computational, memory, and energy resource issues, while (ii) deploying them in the cloud cannot guarantee real-time service and incurs communication/usage costs. In this paper, we design TMO, a local-cloud LLM inference system with Three-M Offloading: Multi-modal, Multi-task, and Multi-dialogue. TMO incorporates (i) a lightweight local LLM that can process simple tasks at high speed and (ii) a large-scale cloud LLM that can handle multi-modal data sources. We develop a resource-constrained reinforcement learning (RCRL) strategy for TMO that optimizes the inference location (i.e., local vs. cloud) and multi-modal data sources to use for each task/dialogue, aiming to maximize the long-term reward (response quality, latency, and usage cost) while adhering to resource constraints. We also contribute M4A1, a new dataset we curated that contains reward and cost metrics across multiple modality, task, dialogue, and LLM configurations, enabling evaluation of offloading decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TMO compared to several exploration-decision and LLM-as-Agent baselines, showing significant improvements in latency, cost, and response quality.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a framework called Transformer-Based Task Scheduling System (TRATSS), designed to address the intricacies of single agent scheduling in graph-based environments. By integrating the latest advancements in reinforcement learning and transformer architecture, TRATSS provides a novel system that outputs optimized task scheduling decisions while dynamically adapting to evolving task requirements and resource availability.

| **[The Role of Environment Access in Agnostic Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05405v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with large state spaces, where function approximation is required for sample-efficient learning. Departing from a long history of prior work, we consider the weakest possible form of function approximation, called agnostic policy learning, where the learner seeks to find the best policy in a given class $\Pi$, with no guarantee that $\Pi$ contains an optimal policy for the underlying task. Although it is known that sample-efficient agnostic policy learning is not possible in the standard online RL setting without further assumptions, we investigate the extent to which this can be overcome with stronger forms of access to the environment. Specifically, we show that: 1. Agnostic policy learning remains statistically intractable when given access to a local simulator, from which one can reset to any previously seen state. This result holds even when the policy class is realizable, and stands in contrast to a positive result of [MFR24] showing that value-based learning under realizability is tractable with local simulator access. 2. Agnostic policy learning remains statistically intractable when given online access to a reset distribution with good coverage properties over the state space (the so-called $\mu$-reset setting). We also study stronger forms of function approximation for policy learning, showing that PSDP [BKSN03] and CPI [KL02] provably fail in the absence of policy completeness. 3. On a positive note, agnostic policy learning is statistically tractable for Block MDPs with access to both of the above reset models. We establish this via a new algorithm that carefully constructs a policy emulator: a tabular MDP with a small state space that approximates the value functions of all policies $\pi \in \Pi$. These values are approximated without any explicit value function class.</p></details> | comments welcome |
| **[Physics-informed Modularized Neural Network for Advanced Building Control by Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05397v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) provides a promising solution for building energy modeling and can serve as a virtual environment to enable reinforcement learning (RL) agents to interact and learn. However, challenges remain in efficiently integrating physics priors, evaluating the effectiveness of physics constraints, balancing model accuracy and physics consistency, and enabling real-world implementation. To address these gaps, this study introduces a Physics-Informed Modularized Neural Network (PI-ModNN), which incorporates physics priors through a physics-informed model structure, loss functions, and hard constraints. A new evaluation metric called "temperature response violation" is developed to quantify the physical consistency of data-driven building dynamic models under varying control inputs and training data sizes. Additionally, a physics prior evaluation framework based on rule importance is proposed to assess the contribution of each individual physics prior, offering guidance on selecting appropriate PIML techniques. Results indicate that incorporating physical priors does not always improve model performance; inappropriate priors may decrease model accuracy and consistency. However, hard constraints are effective in enforcing model consistency. Furthermore, we present a general workflow for developing control-oriented PIML models and integrating them with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Following this framework, a case study implementing DRL in an office space over three months demonstrates potential energy savings of 31.4%. Finally, we provide a general guideline for integrating data-driven models with advanced building control through a four-step evaluation framework, paving the way for reliable and scalable deployment of advanced building controls.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive Explanations for Reinforcement-Learning Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05393v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As reinforcement learning methods increasingly amass accomplishments, the need for comprehending their solutions becomes more crucial. Most explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) methods generate a static explanation depicting their developers' intuition of what should be explained and how. In contrast, literature from the social sciences proposes that meaningful explanations are structured as a dialog between the explainer and the explainee, suggesting a more active role for the user and her communication with the agent. In this paper, we present ASQ-IT -- an interactive explanation system that presents video clips of the agent acting in its environment based on queries given by the user that describe temporal properties of behaviors of interest. Our approach is based on formal methods: queries in ASQ-IT's user interface map to a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf), which we developed, and our algorithm for query processing is based on automata theory. User studies show that end-users can understand and formulate queries in ASQ-IT and that using ASQ-IT assists users in identifying faulty agent behaviors.</p></details> |  |

Previous works often rely on fully observable objects, expert demonstrations, or static grasping poses, which restrict their generalization ability and adaptability to external disturbances. In this paper, we present a reinforcement-learning-based framework that enables zero-shot dynamic dexterous grasping of a wide range of unseen objects from single-view perception, while performing adaptive motions to external disturbances. We utilize a hand-centric object representation for shape feature extraction that emphasizes interaction-relevant local shapes, enhancing robustness to shape variance and uncertainty. To enable effective hand adaptation to disturbances with limited observations, we propose a mixed curriculum learning strategy, which first utilizes imitation learning to distill a policy trained with privileged real-time visual-tactile feedback, and gradually transfers to reinforcement learning to learn adaptive motions under disturbances caused by observation noises and dynamic randomization. Our experiments demonstrate strong generalization in grasping unseen objects with random poses, achieving success rates of 97.0% across 247,786 simulated objects and 94.6% across 512 real objects. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method to various disturbances, including unobserved object movement and external forces, through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

| **[Concise Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05185v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs), a major drawback of reasoning models is their enormous token usage, which increases computational cost, resource requirements, and response time. In this work, we revisit the core principles of reinforcement learning (RL) and, through mathematical analysis, demonstrate that the tendency to generate lengthy responses arises inherently from RL-based optimization during training. This finding questions the prevailing assumption that longer responses inherently improve reasoning accuracy. Instead, we uncover a natural correlation between conciseness and accuracy that has been largely overlooked. Moreover, we show that introducing a secondary phase of RL post-training, using a small set of problems and limited resources, can significantly reduce a model's chain of thought while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy. Finally, we validate our conclusions through extensive experimental results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight and Direct Document Relevance Optimization for Generative Information Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05181v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative information retrieval (GenIR) is a promising neural retrieval paradigm that formulates document retrieval as a document identifier (docid) generation task, allowing for end-to-end optimization toward a unified global retrieval objective. However, existing GenIR models suffer from token-level misalignment, where models trained to predict the next token often fail to capture document-level relevance effectively. While reinforcement learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning from relevance feedback (RLRF), aim to address this misalignment through reward modeling, they introduce significant complexity, requiring the optimization of an auxiliary reward function followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and often unstable. To address these challenges, we propose direct document relevance optimization (DDRO), which aligns token-level docid generation with document-level relevance estimation through direct optimization via pairwise ranking, eliminating the need for explicit reward modeling and reinforcement learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including MS MARCO document and Natural Questions, show that DDRO outperforms reinforcement learning-based methods, achieving a 7.4% improvement in MRR@10 for MS MARCO and a 19.9% improvement for Natural Questions. These findings highlight DDRO's potential to enhance retrieval effectiveness with a simplified optimization approach. By framing alignment as a direct optimization problem, DDRO simplifies the ranking optimization pipeline of GenIR models while offering a viable alternative to reinforcement learning-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures.

| **[RLBayes: a Bayesian Network Structure Learning Algorithm via Reinforcement Learning-Based Search Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05167v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The score-based structure learning of Bayesian network (BN) is an effective way to learn BN models, which are regarded as some of the most compelling probabilistic graphical models in the field of representation and reasoning under uncertainty. However, the search space of structure learning grows super-exponentially as the number of variables increases, which makes BN structure learning an NP-hard problem, as well as a combination optimization problem (COP). Despite the successes of many heuristic methods on it, the results of the structure learning of BN are usually unsatisfactory. Inspired by Q-learning, in this paper, a Bayesian network structure learning algorithm via reinforcement learning-based (RL-based) search strategy is proposed, namely RLBayes. The method borrows the idea of RL and tends to record and guide the learning process by a dynamically maintained Q-table. By creating and maintaining the dynamic Q-table, RLBayes achieve storing the unlimited search space within limited space, thereby achieving the structure learning of BN via Q-learning. Not only is it theoretically proved that RLBayes can converge to the global optimal BN structure, but also it is experimentally proved that RLBayes has a better effect than almost all other heuristic search algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reinforcement Learning Method for Environments with Stochastic Variables: Post-Decision Proximal Policy Optimization with Dual Critic Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05150v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Post-Decision Proximal Policy Optimization (PDPPO), a novel variation of the leading deep reinforcement learning method, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The PDPPO state transition process is divided into two steps: a deterministic step resulting in the post-decision state and a stochastic step leading to the next state. Our approach incorporates post-decision states and dual critics to reduce the problem's dimensionality and enhance the accuracy of value function estimation. Lot-sizing is a mixed integer programming problem for which we exemplify such dynamics. The objective of lot-sizing is to optimize production, delivery fulfillment, and inventory levels in uncertain demand and cost parameters. This paper evaluates the performance of PDPPO across various environments and configurations. Notably, PDPPO with a dual critic architecture achieves nearly double the maximum reward of vanilla PPO in specific scenarios, requiring fewer episode iterations and demonstrating faster and more consistent learning across different initializations. On average, PDPPO outperforms PPO in environments with a stochastic component in the state transition. These results support the benefits of using a post-decision state. Integrating this post-decision state in the value function approximation leads to more informed and efficient learning in high-dimensional and stochastic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Algorithm Discovery With LLMs: Evolutionary Search Meets Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05108v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman, and the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search improves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and mathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[Can RLHF be More Efficient with Imperfect Reward Models? A Policy Coverage Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19255v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency is critical for online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While existing works investigate sample-efficient online exploration strategies, the potential of utilizing misspecified yet relevant reward models to accelerate learning remains underexplored. This paper studies how to transfer knowledge from those imperfect reward models in online RLHF. We start by identifying a novel property of the KL-regularized RLHF objective: \emph{a policy's coverability of the optimal policy is captured by its sub-optimality}. Building on this insight, we propose novel transfer learning principles and a theoretical algorithm with provable benefits compared to standard online learning. Our approach achieves low regret in the early stage by quickly adapting to the best available source reward models without prior knowledge of their quality, and over time, it attains an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound \emph{independent} of structural complexity measures. Empirically, inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop a win-rate-based transfer policy selection method with improved computational efficiency. Moreover, our empirical transfer learning technique is modular and can be integrated with various policy optimization methods, such as DPO, IPO and XPO, to further enhance their performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on summarization tasks.</p></details> | 36 Pages |

While existing RL-based methods demonstrate effectiveness in reducing vehicular congestion, their predominant focus on vehicle-centric optimization leaves pedestrian mobility needs and safety challenges unaddressed. In this paper, we present a deep RL framework for adaptive control of eight traffic signals along a real-world urban corridor, jointly optimizing both pedestrian and vehicular efficiency. Our single-agent policy is trained using real-world pedestrian and vehicle demand data derived from Wi-Fi logs and video analysis. The results demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional fixed-time signals, reducing average wait times per pedestrian and per vehicle by up to 67% and 52%, respectively, while simultaneously decreasing total accumulated wait times for both groups by up to 67% and 53%. Additionally, our results demonstrate generalization capabilities across varying traffic demands, including conditions entirely unseen during training, validating RL's potential for developing transportation systems that serve all road users.</p></details> |  |

We leverage a Growing-Window estimator sampling from interactions with the uncertain and dynamic environment to estimate the thresholds, based on which we design Stochastic Pessimistic-Optimistic Thresholding (SPOT), a novel model-based primal-dual algorithm for multiple constraints against stochastic thresholds. SPOT enables reinforcement learning under both pessimistic and optimistic threshold settings. We prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret and constraint violation; i.e., a reward regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ while allowing an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ constraint violation over $T$ episodes. The theoretical guarantees show that our algorithm achieves performance comparable to that of an approach relying on fixed and clear thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, SPOT is the first reinforcement learning algorithm that realises theoretical guaranteed performance in an uncertain environment where even thresholds are unknown.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Pairwise Framework for RLHF: Bridging Generative Reward Modeling and Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04950v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a important paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences during post-training. This framework typically involves two stages: first, training a reward model on human preference data, followed by optimizing the language model using reinforcement learning algorithms. However, current RLHF approaches may constrained by two limitations. First, existing RLHF frameworks often rely on Bradley-Terry models to assign scalar rewards based on pairwise comparisons of individual responses. However, this approach imposes significant challenges on reward model (RM), as the inherent variability in prompt-response pairs across different contexts demands robust calibration capabilities from the RM. Second, reward models are typically initialized from generative foundation models, such as pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned models, despite the fact that reward models perform discriminative tasks, creating a mismatch. This paper introduces Pairwise-RL, a RLHF framework that addresses these challenges through a combination of generative reward modeling and a pairwise proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Pairwise-RL unifies reward model training and its application during reinforcement learning within a consistent pairwise paradigm, leveraging generative modeling techniques to enhance reward model performance and score calibration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Pairwise-RL outperforms traditional RLHF frameworks across both internal evaluation datasets and standard public benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in improving alignment and model behavior.</p></details> | 11oages,2 figures |

Comparisons against state-of-the-art methods in online and offline model-based reinforcement learning tasks show that our probabilistic Hamiltonian formulation leads to reduced trial costs in offline settings and achieves competitive performance in online scenarios. By bridging optimal control and reinforcement learning, our approach offers a principled and practical framework for controlling uncertain systems with learned dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Inspired by these capabilities, we present a novel DRL framework that incorporates key attributes of animal locomotion: gait transition strategies, pseudo gait procedural memory, and adaptive motion adjustments. This approach enables our framework to achieve unparalleled adaptability, demonstrated through blind zero-shot deployment on complex terrains and recovery from critically unstable states.

At each time, the central scheduler selects one of the sources to probe the quality of its channel to the sink node, and then the assessed channel quality is utilized to determine whether a source will sample and send the packet. For a single source case, we assume that the probed channel quality is known at each time instant, model the problem of AoI minimization as a Markov decision process, and prove the optimal sampling policy threshold structure. We then use this threshold structure and propose an AEC-SW-UCRL2 algorithm to handle unknown and time varying energy harvesting rate and channel statistics, motivated by the popular SWUCRL2 algorithm for non stationary reinforcement learning. This algorithm is applicable when an upper bound is available for the total variation of each of these quantities over a time horizon. Furthermore, in situations where these variation budgets are not accessible, we introduce the AEC-BORL algorithm, motivated by the well known BORL algorithm. For the multiple source case, we demonstrate that the AoI minimization problem can be formulated as a constrained MDP, which can be relaxed using a Lagrange multiplier and decoupled into sub problems across source nodes. We also derive Whittle index based source scheduling policy for probing and an optimal threshold policy for source sampling. We next leverage this Whittle index and threshold structure to develop the WIT-SW-UCRL2 algorithm for unknown time varying energy harvesting rates and channel statistics under their respective variation budgets. Moreover, we also proposed a Whittle index and threshold based bandit over reinforcement learning (WIT-BORL) algorithm for unknown variation budgets. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

However, current approaches predominantly rely on either manually engineered prompts (prompt engineering-based) with brittle performance or reinforcement learning within controlled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) environments (RAG-based) that fail to capture the complexities of real-world interaction. In this paper, we introduce DeepResearcher, the first comprehensive framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based deep research agents through scaling reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world environments with authentic web search interactions. Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information exists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy, unstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized multi-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information from various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical challenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate that DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over prompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL agents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from end-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans, cross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to redirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers. Our results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for developing robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications.

Existing training-free methods, including manually or automated designed workflows, typically demand substantial human effort or yield suboptimal results. This paper proposes Weak-for-Strong Harnessing (W4S), a novel framework that customizes smaller, cost-efficient language models to design and optimize workflows for harnessing stronger models. W4S formulates workflow design as a multi-turn markov decision process and introduces reinforcement learning for agentic workflow optimization (RLAO) to train a weak meta-agent. Through iterative interaction with the environment, the meta-agent learns to design increasingly effective workflows without manual intervention. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of W4S that our 7B meta-agent, trained with just one GPU hour, outperforms the strongest baseline by 2.9% ~ 24.6% across eleven benchmarks, successfully elevating the performance of state-of-the-art models such as GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o. Notably, W4S exhibits strong generalization capabilities across both seen and unseen tasks, offering an efficient, high-performing alternative to directly fine-tuning strong models.</p></details> |  |

Current systems, including target-controlled infusion (TCI) and closed-loop systems, either rely on relatively static pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models or focus on single anesthetic control, limiting personalization and collaborative control. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, Value Decomposition Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (VD-MADRL). VD-MADRL optimizes the collaboration between two anesthetics propofol (Agent I) and remifentanil (Agent II). And It uses a Markov Game (MG) to identify optimal actions among heterogeneous agents. We employ various value function decomposition methods to resolve the credit allocation problem and enhance collaborative control. We also introduce a multivariate environment model based on random forest (RF) for anesthesia state simulation. Additionally, a data resampling and alignment technique ensures synchronized trajectory data. Our experiments on general and thoracic surgery datasets show that VD-MADRL performs better than human experience. It improves dose precision and keeps anesthesia states stable, providing great clinical value.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional approaches like RLHF or RLAIF treat the problem as single-step. As focus shifts toward more complex reasoning and agentic tasks, language models must take multiple steps of text generation, reasoning and environment interaction before generating a solution. We propose a synthetic data generation and RL methodology targeting multi-step optimization scenarios. This approach, called Step-Wise Reinforcement Learning (SWiRL), iteratively generates multi-step reasoning and tool use data, and then learns from that data. It employs a simple step-wise decomposition that breaks each multi-step trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories corresponding to each action by the original model. It then applies synthetic data filtering and RL optimization on these sub-trajectories. We evaluated SWiRL on a number of multi-step tool use, question answering, and mathematical reasoning tasks. Our experiments show that SWiRL outperforms baseline approaches by 21.5%, 12.3%, 14.8%, 11.1%, and 15.3% in relative accuracy on GSM8K, HotPotQA, CofCA, MuSiQue, and BeerQA, respectively. Excitingly, the approach exhibits generalization across tasks: for example, training only on HotPotQA (text question-answering) improves zero-shot performance on GSM8K (a math dataset) by a relative 16.9%.</p></details> |  |
| **[R2Vul: Learning to Reason about Software Vulnerabilities with Reinforcement Learning and Structured Reasoning Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04699v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in software vulnerability detection (SVD), yet their reasoning capabilities remain unreliable. Existing approaches relying on chain-of-thought (CoT) struggle to provide relevant and actionable security assessments. Additionally, effective SVD requires not only generating coherent reasoning but also differentiating between well-founded and misleading yet plausible security assessments, an aspect overlooked in prior work. To this end, we introduce R2Vul, a novel approach that distills structured reasoning into small LLMs using reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF). Through RLAIF, R2Vul enables LLMs to produce structured, security-aware reasoning that is actionable and reliable while explicitly learning to distinguish valid assessments from misleading ones. We evaluate R2Vul across five languages against SAST tools, CoT, instruction tuning, and classification-based baselines. Our results show that R2Vul with structured reasoning distillation enables a 1.5B student LLM to rival larger models while improving generalization to out-of-distribution vulnerabilities. Beyond model improvements, we contribute a large-scale, multilingual preference dataset featuring structured reasoning to support future research in SVD.</p></details> |  |

Autonomous driving technologies have emerged as a potential solution. Among traffic control methods, reinforcement learning has shown superior performance over traffic signals in various scenarios. However, prior research has largely focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections, leaving large-scale mixed traffic control largely unexplored. This study presents the first attempt to use decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning for large-scale mixed traffic control in which some intersections are managed by traffic signals and others by robot vehicles. Evaluating a real-world network in Colorado Springs, CO, USA with 14 intersections, we measure traffic efficiency via average waiting time of vehicles at intersections and the number of vehicles reaching their destinations within a time window (i.e., throughput). At 80% RV penetration rate, our method reduces waiting time from 6.17 s to 5.09 s and increases throughput from 454 vehicles per 500 seconds to 493 vehicles per 500 seconds, outperforming the baseline of fully signalized intersections. These findings suggest that integrating reinforcement learning-based control large-scale traffic can improve overall efficiency and may inform future urban planning strategies.</p></details> |  |

State of the art (SOTA) code repair methods rely on data-driven approaches and often fail to deliver solution for complicated programming questions. To interpret the natural language of unprecedented programming problems, using Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-feedback generation is crucial. LLMs generate more comprehensible feedback than compiler-generated error messages, and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) further enhances quality by integrating human-in-the-loop which helps novice students to lean programming from scratch interactively. We are applying RLHF fine-tuning technique for an expected Socratic response such as a question with hint to solve the programming issue. We are proposing code feedback generation tool by fine-tuning LLM with RLHF, Automated Code Evaluation with RLHF (ACE-RLHF), combining two open-source LLM models with two different SOTA optimization techniques. The quality of feedback is evaluated on two benchmark datasets containing basic and competition-level programming questions where the later is proposed by us. We achieved 2-5% higher accuracy than RL-free SOTA techniques using Llama-3-7B-Proximal-policy optimization in automated evaluation and similar or slightly higher accuracy compared to reward model-free RL with AI Feedback (RLAIF). We achieved almost 40% higher accuracy with GPT-3.5 Best-of-n optimization while performing manual evaluation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[REvolve: Reward Evolution with Large Language Models using Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01309v3)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective reward functions is crucial to training reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, this design is non-trivial, even for domain experts, due to the subjective nature of certain tasks that are hard to quantify explicitly. In recent works, large language models (LLMs) have been used for reward generation from natural language task descriptions, leveraging their extensive instruction tuning and commonsense understanding of human behavior. In this work, we hypothesize that LLMs, guided by human feedback, can be used to formulate reward functions that reflect human implicit knowledge. We study this in three challenging settings -- autonomous driving, humanoid locomotion, and dexterous manipulation -- wherein notions of ``good" behavior are tacit and hard to quantify. To this end, we introduce REvolve, a truly evolutionary framework that uses LLMs for reward design in RL. REvolve generates and refines reward functions by utilizing human feedback to guide the evolution process, effectively translating implicit human knowledge into explicit reward functions for training (deep) RL agents. Experimentally, we demonstrate that agents trained on REvolve-designed rewards outperform other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICLR 2025.

Given that video content is expected to dominate network traffic in LEO satellite systems, this study presents a new video-aware mobility management framework specifically designed for such networks. By combining simulation models with real-world datasets, we highlight the critical role of handoff strategies and throughput prediction algorithms in both single-user and multi-user video streaming scenarios. Building on these insights, we introduce a suite of innovative algorithms that jointly determine satellite selection and video bitrate to enhance users' quality of experience (QoE). Initially, we design model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) based methods for individual users, then extend the approach to manage multiple users sharing a satellite. Notably, we incorporate centralized training with distributed inference in our RL design to develop distributed policies informed by a global view. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through trace-driven simulations and testbed experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trust Region Preference Approximation: A simple and stable reinforcement learning algorithm for LLM reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04524v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved, approaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) while benefiting from large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance Human Alignment (HA) and Reasoning. Recent reward-based optimization algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have achieved significant performance on reasoning tasks, whereas preference-based optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) significantly improve the performance of LLMs on human alignment. However, despite the strong performance of reward-based optimization methods in alignment tasks , they remain vulnerable to reward hacking. Furthermore, preference-based algorithms (such as Online DPO) haven't yet matched the performance of reward-based optimization algorithms (like PPO) on reasoning tasks, making their exploration in this specific area still a worthwhile pursuit. Motivated by these challenges, we propose the Trust Region Preference Approximation (TRPA) algorithm, which integrates rule-based optimization with preference-based optimization for reasoning tasks. As a preference-based algorithm, TRPA naturally eliminates the reward hacking issue. TRPA constructs preference levels using predefined rules, forms corresponding preference pairs, and leverages a novel optimization algorithm for RL training with a theoretical monotonic improvement guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that TRPA not only achieves competitive performance on reasoning tasks but also exhibits robust stability.

To push this paradigm toward practical applications, it is crucial for LLMs to consider tool execution costs (e.g. execution time) for tool planning. Unfortunately, prior studies overlook the tool execution costs, leading to the generation of expensive plans of which the costs outweigh task performance. To fill this gap, we propose the Cost-Aware Tool Planning with LLMs (CATP-LLM) framework, which for the first time provides a coherent design to empower LLMs for cost-aware tool planning. Specifically, CATP-LLM incorporates a tool planning language to enhance the LLM to generate non-sequential plans of multiple branches for efficient concurrent tool execution and cost reduction. Moreover, it further designs a cost-aware offline reinforcement learning algorithm to fine-tune the LLM to optimize the performance-cost trade-off in tool planning. In lack of public cost-related datasets, we further present OpenCATP, the first platform for cost-aware planning evaluation. Experiments on OpenCATP show that CATP-LLM outperforms GPT-4 even when using Llama2-7B as its backbone, with the average improvement of 28.2%-30.2% higher plan performance and 24.7%-45.8% lower costs even on the challenging planning tasks. The codes and dataset will be available at: https://github.com/duowuyms/OpenCATP-LLM.</p></details> | In submission |

As the demand escalates, these algorithms are struggling to cope. In this context, reinforcement learning (RL) and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms emerge as promising solutions. However, the urgency and importance of the problem are clear, as existing RL/MARL-based routing approaches lack effective communication in run time among routers, making it challenging for individual routers to adapt to complex and dynamic changing networks. More importantly, they lack the ability to deal with dynamically changing network topology, especially the addition of the router, due to the non-scalability of their neural networks. This paper proposes a novel dynamic routing algorithm, DRAMA, incorporating emergent communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Through emergent communication, routers could learn how to communicate effectively to maximize the optimization objectives. Meanwhile, a new Q-network and graph-based emergent communication are introduced to dynamically adapt to the changing network topology without retraining while ensuring robust performance. Experimental results showcase DRAMA's superior performance over the traditional routing algorithm and other RL/MARL-based algorithms, achieving a higher delivery rate and lower latency in diverse network scenarios, including dynamic network load and topology. Moreover, an ablation experiment validates the prospect of emergent communication in facilitating packet routing.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted by IJCNN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Deliberate Planning of 3D Bin Packing on Packing Configuration Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04421v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP) has widespread applications in industrial automation. Existing methods usually solve the problem with limited resolution of spatial discretization, and/or cannot deal with complex practical constraints well. We propose to enhance the practical applicability of online 3D-BPP via learning on a novel hierarchical representation, packing configuration tree (PCT). PCT is a full-fledged description of the state and action space of bin packing which can support packing policy learning based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The size of the packing action space is proportional to the number of leaf nodes, making the DRL model easy to train and well-performing even with continuous solution space. We further discover the potential of PCT as tree-based planners in deliberately solving packing problems of industrial significance, including large-scale packing and different variations of BPP setting. A recursive packing method is proposed to decompose large-scale packing into smaller sub-trees while a spatial ensemble mechanism integrates local solutions into global. For different BPP variations with additional decision variables, such as lookahead, buffering, and offline packing, we propose a unified planning framework enabling out-of-the-box problem solving. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing online BPP baselines and is versatile in incorporating various practical constraints. The planning process excels across large-scale problems and diverse problem variations. We develop a real-world packing robot for industrial warehousing, with careful designs accounting for constrained placement and transportation stability. Our packing robot operates reliably and efficiently on unprotected pallets at 10 seconds per box. It achieves averagely 19 boxes per pallet with 57.4% space utilization for relatively large-size boxes.</p></details> |  |

AI research in CPS has been led by heuristic tree search and online self-play, but the game may also create a platform to study adaptive policies trained offline on large datasets. We develop a pipeline to reconstruct the first-person perspective of an agent from logs saved from the third-person perspective of a spectator, thereby unlocking a dataset of real human battles spanning more than a decade that grows larger every day. This dataset enables a black-box approach where we train large sequence models to adapt to their opponent based solely on their input trajectory while selecting moves without explicit search of any kind. We study a progression from imitation learning to offline RL and offline fine-tuning on self-play data in the hardcore competitive setting of Pok\'emon's four oldest (and most partially observed) game generations. The resulting agents outperform a recent LLM Agent approach and a strong heuristic search engine. While playing anonymously in online battles against humans, our best agents climb to rankings inside the top 10% of active players.</p></details> |  |

Our approach constructs a six-level policy hierarchy, where each higher-level policy generates subgoals for the level below. All subgoals and policies are learned end-to-end from scratch, without any domain knowledge. Our results show that the agent can generate long action sequences from a single high-level call. While prior work has explored 2-3 level hierarchies and subgoal-based planning heuristics, we demonstrate that deep recursive goal decomposition can emerge purely from learning, and that such hierarchies can scale effectively to hard puzzle domains.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Towards Efficient Risk-Sensitive Policy Gradient: An Iteration Complexity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08955v3)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown exceptional performance across various applications, enabling autonomous agents to learn optimal policies through interaction with their environments. However, traditional RL frameworks often face challenges in terms of iteration efficiency and robustness. Risk-sensitive policy gradient methods, which incorporate both expected return and risk measures, have been explored for their ability to yield more robust policies, yet their iteration complexity remains largely underexplored. In this work, we conduct a rigorous iteration complexity analysis for the risk-sensitive policy gradient method, focusing on the REINFORCE algorithm with an exponential utility function. We establish an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point (FOSP). Furthermore, we investigate whether risk-sensitive algorithms can achieve better iteration complexity compared to their risk-neutral counterparts. Our analysis indicates that risk-sensitive REINFORCE can potentially converge faster. To validate our analysis, we empirically evaluate the learning performance and convergence efficiency of the risk-neutral and risk-sensitive REINFORCE algorithms in multiple environments: CartPole, MiniGrid, and Robot Navigation. Empirical results confirm that risk-averse cases can converge and stabilize faster compared to their risk-neutral counterparts.

| **[REINFORCE++: An Efficient RLHF Algorithm with Robustness to Both Prompt and Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03262v3)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences. While state-of-the-art applications like ChatGPT/GPT-4 commonly employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the inclusion of a critic network introduces significant computational overhead. REINFORCE-based methods, such as REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), address this limitation by eliminating the critic network. However, these approaches face challenges in accurate advantage estimation. Specifically, they estimate advantages independently for responses to each prompt, which can lead to overfitting on simpler prompts and vulnerability to reward hacking. To address these challenges, we introduce REINFORCE++, a novel approach that removes the critic model while using the normalized reward of a batch as the baseline. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that REINFORCE++ exhibits robust performance across various reward models without requiring prompt set truncation. Furthermore, it achieves superior generalization in both RLHF and long chain-of-thought (CoT) settings compared to existing REINFORCE-based methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF.</p></details> | fix typo |
| **[Economic Battery Storage Dispatch with Deep Reinforcement Learning from Rule-Based Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04326v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to economic battery dispatch problems has significantly increased recently. However, optimizing battery dispatch over long horizons can be challenging due to delayed rewards. In our experiments we observe poor performance of popular actor-critic algorithms when trained on yearly episodes with hourly resolution. To address this, we propose an approach extending soft actor-critic (SAC) with learning from demonstrations. The special feature of our approach is that, due to the absence of expert demonstrations, the demonstration data is generated through simple, rule-based policies. We conduct a case study on a grid-connected microgrid and use if-then-else statements based on the wholesale price of electricity to collect demonstrations. These are stored in a separate replay buffer and sampled with linearly decaying probability along with the agent's own experiences. Despite these minimal modifications and the imperfections in the demonstration data, the results show a drastic performance improvement regarding both sample efficiency and final rewards. We further show that the proposed method reliably outperforms the demonstrator and is robust to the choice of rule, as long as the rule is sufficient to guide early training into the right direction.</p></details> |  |

Model-based methods usually depend on predefined gaits, while model-free approaches lack explicit mode-switching knowledge. Current methods identify discrete modes via segmentation before regressing continuous flow, but learning high-dimensional complex rigid body dynamics without trajectory labels or segmentation is a challenging open problem. This paper introduces Discrete-time Hybrid Automata Learning (DHAL), a framework to identify and execute mode-switching without trajectory segmentation or event function learning. Besides, we embedded it in reinforcement learning pipeline and incorporates a beta policy distribution and a multi-critic architecture to model contact-guided motions, exemplified by a challenging quadrupedal robot skateboard task. We validate our method through sufficient real-world tests, demonstrating robust performance and mode identification consistent with human intuition in hybrid dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs), our approach employs a novel generative deep reinforcement learning framework with a decoupling feedback system embedded in the adversarial training loop, which we term as the \emph{reinforcement link}. This architecture stabilizes the training dynamics by incorporating feedback from the discriminator. Our theoretically guided feedback mechanism enables the decoupling of the equilibrium system, overcoming challenges that hinder conventional numerical algorithms. Experimentally, our algorithm not only learns but also provides testable predictions on how asset returns and volatilities emerge from the endogenous trading behavior of market participants, where traditional analytical methods fall short. The design of our model is further supported by an approximation guarantee.</p></details> |  |

A human-like form factor further enables the use of vast datasets of human-hand interactions. However, the primary bottleneck in dexterous manipulation lies not only in software but arguably even more in hardware. Robotic hands that approach human capabilities are often prohibitively expensive, bulky, or require enterprise-level maintenance, limiting their accessibility for broader research and practical applications. What if the research community could get started with reliable dexterous hands within a day? We present the open-source ORCA hand, a reliable and anthropomorphic 17-DoF tendon-driven robotic hand with integrated tactile sensors, fully assembled in less than eight hours and built for a material cost below 2,000 CHF. We showcase ORCA's key design features such as popping joints, auto-calibration, and tensioning systems that significantly reduce complexity while increasing reliability, accuracy, and robustness. We benchmark the ORCA hand across a variety of tasks, ranging from teleoperation and imitation learning to zero-shot sim-to-real reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate its durability, withstanding more than 10,000 continuous operation cycles - equivalent to approximately 20 hours - without hardware failure, the only constraint being the duration of the experiment itself.

However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Order Picking in Warehouse Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01656v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Order picking is a pivotal operation in warehouses that directly impacts overall efficiency and profitability. This study addresses the dynamic order picking problem, a significant concern in modern warehouse management, where real-time adaptation to fluctuating order arrivals and efficient picker routing are crucial. Traditional methods, which often depend on static optimization algorithms designed around fixed order sets for the picker routing, fall short in addressing the challenges of this dynamic environment. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework tailored for single-block warehouses equipped with an autonomous picking device. By dynamically optimizing picker routes, our approach significantly reduces order throughput times and unfulfilled orders, particularly under high order arrival rates. We benchmark our DRL model against established algorithms, utilizing instances generated based on standard practices in the order picking literature. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our DRL model over benchmark algorithms. For example, at a high order arrival rate of 0.09 (i.e., 9 orders per 100 units of time on average), our approach achieves an order fulfillment rate of approximately 98%, compared to the 82% fulfillment rate observed with benchmarking algorithms. We further investigate the integration of a hyperparameter in the reward function that allows for flexible balancing between distance traveled and order completion time. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our DRL model on out-of-sample test instances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02495v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted in post-training for large language models (LLMs) at scale. Recently, the incentivization of reasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that $\textit{proper learning methods could enable effective inference-time scalability}$. A key challenge of RL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond verifiable questions or artificial rules. In this work, we investigate how to improve reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries, i.e. the $\textbf{inference-time scalability of generalist RM}$, and further, how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper learning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward modeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential for inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs through online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately, resulting in $\textbf{DeepSeek-GRM}$ models. Furthermore, for effective inference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and introduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance. Empirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM benchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared to training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks, which we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward systems. The models will be released and open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review. 42 pages</p></details> |

Specifically, we first train an RL agent to solve the pose reaching task in simulation, then transfer the learned planning knowledge to an MPC by incorporating the trained neural network critic as both the stage and terminal cost. We show through comprehensive simulations that the resulting MPC inherits the time-efficient behavior of the RL agent, generating trajectories that compare favorably against those found using trajectory optimization.

Current reinforcement learning approaches face critical limitations: manually designed rewards lack scalability across diverse tasks, while demonstration-based methods struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. We introduce GROVE, a generalized reward framework that enables open-vocabulary physical skill learning without manual engineering or task-specific demonstrations. Our key insight is that Large Language Models(LLMs) and Vision Language Models(VLMs) provide complementary guidance -- LLMs generate precise physical constraints capturing task requirements, while VLMs evaluate motion semantics and naturalness. Through an iterative design process, VLM-based feedback continuously refines LLM-generated constraints, creating a self-improving reward system. To bridge the domain gap between simulation and natural images, we develop Pose2CLIP, a lightweight mapper that efficiently projects agent poses directly into semantic feature space without computationally expensive rendering. Extensive experiments across diverse embodiments and learning paradigms demonstrate GROVE's effectiveness, achieving 22.2% higher motion naturalness and 25.7% better task completion scores while training 8.4x faster than previous methods. These results establish a new foundation for scalable physical skill acquisition in simulated environments.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we first reveal that the information conflicts in current visual MBRL algorithms stem from visual representation learning and latent dynamics modeling with an information-theoretic perspective. Based on this finding, we present a new algorithm to resolve information conflicts for visual MBRL, named MInCo, which mitigates information conflicts by leveraging negative-free contrastive learning, aiding in learning invariant representation and robust policies despite noisy observations. To prevent the dominance of visual representation learning, we introduce time-varying reweighting to bias the learning towards dynamics modeling as training proceeds. We evaluate our method on several robotic control tasks with dynamic background distractions. Our experiments demonstrate that MInCo learns invariant representations against background noise and consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art visual MBRL methods.

Challenges such as collision avoidance, station-keeping, and orbital maneuvering require advanced techniques to handle dynamic uncertainties and multi-agent interactions. Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in this domain, enabling adaptive, autonomous policies for space operations; however, many existing RL frameworks rely on custom-built environments developed from scratch, which often use simplified models and require significant time to implement and validate the orbital dynamics, limiting their ability to fully capture real-world complexities. To address this, we introduce OrbitZoo, a versatile multi-agent RL environment built on a high-fidelity industry standard library, that enables realistic data generation, supports scenarios like collision avoidance and cooperative maneuvers, and ensures robust and accurate orbital dynamics. The environment is validated against a real satellite constellation, Starlink, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.16% compared to real-world data. This validation ensures reliability for generating high-fidelity simulations and enabling autonomous and independent satellite operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A General Peg-in-Hole Assembly Policy Based on Domain Randomized Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04148v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalization is important for peg-in-hole assembly, a fundamental industrial operation, to adapt to dynamic industrial scenarios and enhance manufacturing efficiency. While prior work has enhanced generalization ability for pose variations, spatial generalization to six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) is less researched, limiting application in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses this limitation by developing a general policy GenPiH using Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO) and dynamic simulation with domain randomization. The policy learning experiment demonstrates the policy's generalization ability with nearly 100\% success insertion across over eight thousand unique hole poses in parallel environments, and sim-to-real validation on a UR10e robot confirms the policy's performance through direct trajectory execution without task-specific tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline reinforcement learning for job-shop scheduling problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15714v3)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have shown significant potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems in real-time. Unlike traditional methods, deep learning can generate high-quality solutions efficiently, which is crucial for applications like routing and scheduling. However, existing approaches like deep reinforcement learning (RL) and behavioral cloning have notable limitations, with deep RL suffering from slow learning and behavioral cloning relying solely on expert actions, which can lead to generalization issues and neglect of the optimization objective. This paper introduces a novel offline RL method designed for combinatorial optimization problems with complex constraints, where the state is represented as a heterogeneous graph and the action space is variable. Our approach encodes actions in edge attributes and balances expected rewards with the imitation of expert solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on job-shop scheduling and flexible job-shop scheduling benchmarks, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

Although existing large language models (LLMs) can generate responses to legal questions, they fail to perform explicit syllogistic reasoning, often producing implicit and unstructured answers that lack explainability and trustworthiness. To address this limitation, we propose SyLeR, a novel framework that empowers LLMs to engage in explicit syllogistic legal reasoning. SyLeR integrates a tree-structured hierarchical retrieval mechanism to effectively combine relevant legal statutes and precedent cases, forming comprehensive major premises. This is followed by a two-stage fine-tuning process: supervised fine-tuning warm-up establishes a foundational understanding of syllogistic reasoning, while reinforcement learning with a structure-aware reward mechanism refines the ability of the model to generate diverse logically sound and well-structured reasoning paths. We conducted extensive experiments across various dimensions, including in-domain and cross-domain user groups (legal laypersons and practitioners), multiple languages (Chinese and French), and different LLM backbones (legal-specific and open-domain LLMs). The results show that SyLeR significantly improves response accuracy and consistently delivers explicit, explainable, and trustworthy legal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Reflection in Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04022v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A language model's ability to reflect on its own reasoning provides a key advantage for solving complex problems. While most recent research has focused on how this ability develops during reinforcement learning, we show that it actually begins to emerge much earlier - during the model's pre-training. To study this, we introduce deliberate errors into chains-of-thought and test whether the model can still arrive at the correct answer by recognizing and correcting these mistakes. By tracking performance across different stages of pre-training, we observe that this self-correcting ability appears early and improves steadily over time. For instance, an OLMo2-7B model pre-trained on 4 trillion tokens displays self-correction on our six self-reflection tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, selecting the most appropriate underwater robotic simulator (URS) remains a challenge due to wide variations in fidelity, extensibility, and task suitability. This paper presents a comprehensive review and comparative analysis of five state-of-the-art, ROS-compatible, open-source URSs: Stonefish, DAVE, HoloOcean, MARUS, and UNav-Sim. Each simulator is evaluated across multiple criteria including sensor fidelity, environmental realism, sim-to-real capabilities, and research impact. We evaluate them across architectural design, sensor and physics modeling, task capabilities, and research impact. Additionally, we discuss ongoing challenges in sim-to-real transfer and highlight the need for standardization and benchmarking in the field. Our findings aim to guide practitioners in selecting effective simulation environments and inform future development of more robust and transferable URSs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, Confidence-Aware Contrastive Conditional Consistency Model (4CNet), for robot map prediction during decentralized, resource-limited multi-robot exploration. 4CNet uniquely incorporates: 1) a conditional consistency model for map prediction in unstructured unknown regions, 2) a contrastive map-trajectory pretraining framework for a trajectory encoder that extracts spatial information from the trajectories of nearby robots during map prediction, and 3) a confidence network to measure the uncertainty of map prediction for effective exploration under resource constraints. We incorporate 4CNet within our proposed robot exploration with map prediction architecture, 4CNet-E. We then conduct extensive comparison studies with 4CNet-E and state-of-the-art heuristic and learning methods to investigate both map prediction and exploration performance in environments consisting of irregularly shaped obstacles and uneven terrain. Results showed that 4CNet-E obtained statistically significant higher prediction accuracy and area coverage with varying environment sizes, number of robots, energy budgets, and communication limitations when compared to database and learning-based methods. Hardware experiments were performed and validated the applicability and generalizability of 4CNet-E in both unstructured indoor and real natural outdoor environments.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |

We combine principles from Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Universal Design (UD) with symbolic communication strategies to facilitate the alignment of mental models between humans and robots. Our approach employs Asterics Grid and ARASAAC pictograms as a multimodal, interpretable front-end, integrated with a lightweight HTTP-to-ROS 2 bridge that enables real-time interaction and explanation triggering. We emphasize that explainability is not a one-way function but a bidirectional process, where human understanding and robot transparency must co-evolve. We further argue that in educational or assistive contexts, the role of a human mediator (e.g., a teacher) may be essential to support shared understanding. We validate our framework with examples of multimodal explanation boards and discuss how it can be extended to different scenarios in education, assistive robotics, and inclusive AI.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[GRAPPA: Generalizing and Adapting Robot Policies via Online Agentic Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06473v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning approaches such as behavior cloning and reinforcement learning have shown great promise in synthesizing robot skills from human demonstrations in specific environments. However, these approaches often require task-specific demonstrations or designing complex simulation environments, which limits the development of generalizable and robust policies for unseen real-world settings. Recent advances in the use of foundation models for robotics (e.g., LLMs, VLMs) have shown great potential in enabling systems to understand the semantics in the world from large-scale internet data. However, it remains an open challenge to use this knowledge to enable robotic systems to understand the underlying dynamics of the world, to generalize policies across different tasks, and to adapt policies to new environments. To alleviate these limitations, we propose an agentic framework for robot self-guidance and self-improvement, which consists of a set of role-specialized conversational agents, such as a high-level advisor, a grounding agent, a monitoring agent, and a robotic agent. Our framework iteratively grounds a base robot policy to relevant objects in the environment and uses visuomotor cues to shift the action distribution of the policy to more desirable states, online, while remaining agnostic to the subjective configuration of a given robot hardware platform. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide manipulation policies to achieve significantly higher success rates, both in simulation and in real-world experiments, without the need for additional human demonstrations or extensive exploration.

Toward such a socially acceptable Human-Robot Interaction, we conducted a study ($N=24$) in an AR-simulated context of a coffee chat. Participants elicited social cues to signal intentions to an anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, grounded technical, or aerial technical robot waiter when they were speakers or listeners. Our findings reveal common patterns of social cues over intentions, the effects of robot morphology on social cue position and conversational role on social cue complexity, and users' rationale in choosing social cues. We offer insights into understanding social cues concerning perceptions of robots, cognitive load, and social context. Additionally, we discuss design considerations on approaching, social cue recognition, and response strategies for future service robots.</p></details> | CHI '25 |

Solving such dexterous manipulation tasks often relies on imitation learning from demonstration datasets, which are typically collected via teleoperation systems and often demand substantial time and effort. To address these challenges, we present ViTaMIn, an embodiment-free manipulation interface that seamlessly integrates visual and tactile sensing into a hand-held gripper, enabling data collection without the need for teleoperation. Our design employs a compliant Fin Ray gripper with tactile sensing, allowing operators to perceive force feedback during manipulation for more intuitive operation. Additionally, we propose a multimodal representation learning strategy to obtain pre-trained tactile representations, improving data efficiency and policy robustness. Experiments on seven contact-rich manipulation tasks demonstrate that ViTaMIn significantly outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for complex manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Adversarial Obstacle Attacks in Search-based Path Planning for Autonomous Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06154v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Path planning algorithms, such as the search-based A*, are a critical component of autonomous mobile robotics, enabling robots to navigate from a starting point to a destination efficiently and safely. We investigated the resilience of the A* algorithm in the face of potential adversarial interventions known as obstacle attacks. The adversary's goal is to delay the robot's timely arrival at its destination by introducing obstacles along its original path. We developed malicious software to execute the attacks and conducted experiments to assess their impact, both in simulation using TurtleBot in Gazebo and in real-world deployment with the Unitree Go1 robot. In simulation, the attacks resulted in an average delay of 36\%, with the most significant delays occurring in scenarios where the robot was forced to take substantially longer alternative paths. In real-world experiments, the delays were even more pronounced, with all attacks successfully rerouting the robot and causing measurable disruptions. These results highlight that the algorithm's robustness is not solely an attribute of its design but is significantly influenced by the operational environment. For example, in constrained environments like tunnels, the delays were maximized due to the limited availability of alternative routes.</p></details> |  |
| **[A robot-assisted pipeline to rapidly scan 1.7 million historical aerial photographs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24063v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During the 20th Century, aerial surveys captured hundreds of millions of high-resolution photographs of the earth's surface. These images, the precursors to modern satellite imagery, represent an extraordinary visual record of the environmental and social upheavals of the 20th Century. However, most of these images currently languish in physical archives where retrieval is difficult and costly. Digitization could revolutionize access, but manual scanning is slow and expensive. Here, we describe and validate a novel robot-assisted pipeline that increases worker productivity in scanning 30-fold, applied at scale to digitize an archive of 1.7 million historical aerial photographs from 65 countries.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAPLE: Encoding Dexterous Robotic Manipulation Priors Learned From Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06084v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale egocentric video datasets capture diverse human activities across a wide range of scenarios, offering rich and detailed insights into how humans interact with objects, especially those that require fine-grained dexterous control. Such complex, dexterous skills with precise controls are crucial for many robotic manipulation tasks, yet are often insufficiently addressed by traditional data-driven approaches to robotic manipulation. To address this gap, we leverage manipulation priors learned from large-scale egocentric video datasets to improve policy learning for dexterous robotic manipulation tasks. We present MAPLE, a novel method for dexterous robotic manipulation that exploits rich manipulation priors to enable efficient policy learning and better performance on diverse, complex manipulation tasks. Specifically, we predict hand-object contact points and detailed hand poses at the moment of hand-object contact and use the learned features to train policies for downstream manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MAPLE across existing simulation benchmarks, as well as a newly designed set of challenging simulation tasks, which require fine-grained object control and complex dexterous skills. The benefits of MAPLE are further highlighted in real-world experiments using a dexterous robotic hand, whereas simultaneous evaluation across both simulation and real-world experiments has remained underexplored in prior work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Statistics vs. Machine Learning vs. Bayesian Inference: Insights into Handling Faulty GNSS Measurements in Field Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06015v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents research findings on handling faulty measurements (i.e., outliers) of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) for robot localization under adverse signal conditions in field applications, where raw GNSS data are frequently corrupted due to environmental interference such as multipath, signal blockage, or non-line-of-sight conditions. In this context, we investigate three strategies applied specifically to GNSS pseudorange observations: robust statistics for error mitigation, machine learning for faulty measurement prediction, and Bayesian inference for noise distribution approximation. Since previous studies have provided limited insight into the theoretical foundations and practical evaluations of these three methodologies within a unified problem statement (i.e., state estimation using ranging sensors), we conduct extensive experiments using real-world sensor data collected in diverse urban environments. Our goal is to examine both established techniques and newly proposed methods, thereby advancing the understanding of how to handle faulty range measurements, such as GNSS, for robust, long-term robot localization. In addition to presenting successful results, this work highlights critical observations and open questions to motivate future research in robust state estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Vertex Motion Estimation for Integrated Video Stabilization and Stitching in Tractor-Trailer Wheeled Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07154v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tractor-trailer wheeled robots need to perform comprehensive perception tasks to enhance their operations in areas such as logistics parks and long-haul transportation. The perception of these robots faces three major challenges: the asynchronous vibrations between the tractor and trailer, the relative pose change between the tractor and trailer, and the significant camera parallax caused by the large size. In this paper, we employ the Dual Independence Stabilization Motion Field Estimation method to address asynchronous vibrations between the tractor and trailer, effectively eliminating conflicting motion estimations for the same object in overlapping regions. We utilize the Random Plane-based Stitching Motion Field Estimation method to tackle the continuous relative pose changes caused by the articulated hitch between the tractor and trailer, thus eliminating dynamic misalignment in overlapping regions. Furthermore, we apply the Unified Vertex Motion Estimation method to manage the challenges posed by the tractor-trailer's large physical size, which results in severely low overlapping regions between the tractor and trailer views, thus preventing distortions in overlapping regions from exponentially propagating into non-overlapping areas. Furthermore, this framework has been successfully implemented in real tractor-trailer wheeled robots. The proposed Unified Vertex Motion Video Stabilization and Stitching method has been thoroughly tested in various challenging scenarios, demonstrating its accuracy and practicality in real-world.</p></details> |  |
| **[PTRL: Prior Transfer Deep Reinforcement Learning for Legged Robots Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05629v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of legged robot motion control, reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise but faces two major challenges: high computational cost for training individual robots and poor generalization of trained models. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel framework called Prior Transfer Reinforcement Learning (PTRL), which improves both training efficiency and model transferability across different robots. Drawing inspiration from model transfer techniques in deep learning, PTRL introduces a fine-tuning mechanism that selectively freezes layers of the policy network during transfer, making it the first to apply such a method in RL. The framework consists of three stages: pre-training on a source robot using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, transferring the learned policy to a target robot, and fine-tuning with partial network freezing. Extensive experiments on various robot platforms confirm that this approach significantly reduces training time while maintaining or even improving performance. Moreover, the study quantitatively analyzes how the ratio of frozen layers affects transfer results, providing valuable insights into optimizing the process. The experimental outcomes show that PTRL achieves better walking control performance and demonstrates strong generalization and adaptability, offering a promising solution for efficient and scalable RL-based control of legged robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Formation Shape Control of Identity-less Robot Swarms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23581v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different from most of the formation strategies where robots require unique labels to identify topological neighbors to satisfy the predefined shape constraints, we here study the problem of identity-less distributed shape formation in homogeneous swarms, which is rarely studied in the literature. The absence of identities creates a unique challenge: how to design appropriate target formations and local behaviors that are suitable for identity-less formation shape control. To address this challenge, we propose the following novel results. First, to avoid using unique identities, we propose a dynamic formation description method and solve the formation consensus of robots in a locally distributed manner. Second, to handle identity-less distributed formations, we propose a fully distributed control law for homogeneous swarms based on locally sensed information. While the existing methods are applicable to simple cases where the target formation is stationary, ours can tackle more general maneuvering formations such as translation, rotation, or even shape deformation. Both numerical simulation and flight experiment are presented to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed formation strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lazy-DaSH: Lazy Approach for Hypergraph-based Multi-robot Task and Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05552v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Lazy-DaSH, an improvement over the recent state of the art multi-robot task and motion planning method DaSH, which scales to more than double the number of robots and objects compared to the original method and achieves an order of magnitude faster planning time when applied to a multi-manipulator object rearrangement problem. We achieve this improvement through a hierarchical approach, where a high-level task planning layer identifies planning spaces required for task completion, and motion feasibility is validated lazily only within these spaces. In contrast, DaSH precomputes the motion feasibility of all possible actions, resulting in higher costs for constructing state space representations. Lazy-DaSH maintains efficient query performance by utilizing a constraint feedback mechanism within its hierarchical structure, ensuring that motion feasibility is effectively conveyed to the query process. By maintaining smaller state space representations, our method significantly reduces both representation construction time and query time. We evaluate Lazy-DaSH in four distinct scenarios, demonstrating its scalability to increasing numbers of robots and objects, as well as its adaptability in resolving conflicts through the constraint feedback mechanism.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in low-cost teleoperation devices and VR/AR technologies have expanded accessibility, particularly for bimanual robot manipulators. However, transitioning from in-person to remote teleoperation presents challenges in task performance. We introduce SPARK, a kinematically scaled, low-cost teleoperation system for operating bimanual robots. Its effectiveness is compared to existing technologies like the 3D SpaceMouse and VR/AR controllers. We further extend SPARK to SPARK-Remote, integrating sensor-based force feedback using haptic gloves and a force controller for remote teleoperation. We evaluate SPARK and SPARK-Remote variants on 5 bimanual manipulation tasks which feature operational properties - positional precision, rotational precision, large movements in the workspace, and bimanual collaboration - to test the effective teleoperation modes. Our findings offer insights into improving low-cost teleoperation interfaces for real-world applications.

For this problem class, conventional optimizers suffer from small step sizes and slow convergence. We propose BC-ADMM, a variant of Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM), that can solve a class of non-convex constrained optimizations with biconvex constraint relaxation. Our algorithm allows larger step sizes by breaking the problem into small-scale sub-problems that can be easily solved in parallel. We show that our method has both theoretical convergence speed guarantees and practical convergence guarantees in the asymptotic sense. Through numerical experiments in a row of four robotic applications, we show that BC-ADMM has faster convergence than conventional gradient descent and Newton's method in terms of wall clock time.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Formalisation of the Purpose Framework: the Autonomy-Alignment Problem in Open-Ended Learning Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02514v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unprecedented advancement of artificial intelligence enables the development of increasingly autonomous robots. These robots hold significant potential, particularly in moving beyond engineered factory settings to operate in the unstructured environments inhabited by humans. However, this possibility also generates a relevant autonomy-alignment problem to ensure that robots' autonomous learning processes still focus on acquiring knowledge relevant to accomplish human practical purposes, while their behaviour still aligns with their broader purposes. The literature has only begun to address this problem, and a conceptual, terminological, and formal framework is still lacking. Here we address one of the most challenging instances of the problem: autonomous open-ended learning (OEL) robots, capable of cumulatively acquiring new skills and knowledge through direct interaction with the environment, guided by self-generated goals and intrinsic motivations. In particular, we propose a computational framework, first introduced qualitatively and then formalised, to support the design of OEL robot architectures that balance autonomy and control. The framework pivots on the novel concept of purpose. A human purpose specifies what humans (e.g., designers or users) want the robot to learn, do or not do, within a certain boundary of autonomy and independently of the domains in which it operates.The framework decomposes the autonomy-alignment problem into more tractable sub-problems: the alignment of `robot purposes' with human purposes, either by hardwiring or through learning; the arbitration between multiple purposes; the grounding of purposes into specific domain-dependent robot goals; and the competence acquisition needed to accomplish these goals. The framework and its potential utility are further elucidated through the discussion of hypothetical example scenarios framed within it.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |

One of the promising areas for further exploration lies in human trust. A real-time, objective model of human trust could be used to maximize productivity, preserve safety, and mitigate failure. In this work, we attempt to use physiological measures, gaze, and facial expressions to model human trust in a robot partner. We are the first to design an in-person, human-robot supervisory interaction study to create a dedicated trust dataset. Using this dataset, we train machine learning algorithms to identify the objective measures that are most indicative of trust in a robot partner, advancing trust prediction in human-robot interactions. Our findings indicate that a combination of sensor modalities (blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and gaze) can enhance the accuracy of detecting human trust in a robot partner. Furthermore, the Extra Trees, Random Forest, and Decision Trees classifiers exhibit consistently better performance in measuring the person's trust in the robot partner. These results lay the groundwork for constructing a real-time trust model for human-robot interaction, which could foster more efficient interactions between humans and robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2025</p></details> |

We emphasize the interplay between perception and motion planning in decision-making by introducing the concept of occupancy queries to quantify the perception requirements for sampling-based motion planners. Sensor and algorithm performance are evaluated using False Negative Rates (FPR) and False Positive Rates (FPR) across various factors such as geometric relationships, object properties, sensor resolution, and environmental conditions. By integrating perception requirements with perception performance, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach is proposed for efficient sensor and algorithm selection and placement. This forms the basis for a co-design optimization that includes the robot body, motion planner, perception pipeline, and computing unit. We refer to this framework for solving the co-design problem of mobile robots as CODEI, short for Co-design of Embodied Intelligence. A case study on developing an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) for urban scenarios provides actionable information for designers, and shows that complex tasks escalate resource demands, with task performance affecting choices of the autonomy stack. The study demonstrates that resource prioritization influences sensor choice: cameras are preferred for cost-effective and lightweight designs, while lidar sensors are chosen for better energy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 33 images, IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Speech-to-Trajectory: Learning Human-Like Verbal Guidance for Robot Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05084v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Full integration of robots into real-life applications necessitates their ability to interpret and execute natural language directives from untrained users. Given the inherent variability in human language, equivalent directives may be phrased differently, yet require consistent robot behavior. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced language understanding, they often falter in handling user phrasing variability, rely on predefined commands, and exhibit unpredictable outputs. This letter introduces the Directive Language Model (DLM), a novel speech-to-trajectory framework that directly maps verbal commands to executable motion trajectories, bypassing predefined phrases. DLM utilizes Behavior Cloning (BC) on simulated demonstrations of human-guided robot motion. To enhance generalization, GPT-based semantic augmentation generates diverse paraphrases of training commands, labeled with the same motion trajectory. DLM further incorporates a diffusion policy-based trajectory generation for adaptive motion refinement and stochastic sampling. In contrast to LLM-based methods, DLM ensures consistent, predictable motion without extensive prompt engineering, facilitating real-time robotic guidance. As DLM learns from trajectory data, it is embodiment-agnostic, enabling deployment across diverse robotic platforms.

CONCERT has been designed to support human activities in construction sites by leveraging two main characteristics: high-power density motors and modularity. In this way, the robot is able to perform a wide range of highly demanding tasks by acting as a co-worker of the human operator or by autonomously executing them following user instructions. Most of its versatility comes from the possibility of rapidly changing its kinematic structure by adding or removing passive or active modules. In this way, the robot can be set up in a vast set of morphologies, consequently changing its workspace and capabilities depending on the task to be executed. In the same way, distal end-effectors can be replaced for the execution of different operations. This paper also includes a full description of the software pipeline employed to automatically discover and deploy the robot morphology. Specifically, depending on the modules installed, the robot updates the kinematic, dynamic, and geometric parameters, taking into account the information embedded in each module. In this way, we demonstrate how the robot can be fully reassembled and made operational in less than ten minutes. We validated the CONCERT robot across different use cases, including drilling, sanding, plastering, and collaborative transportation with obstacle avoidance, all performed in a real construction site scenario. We demonstrated the robot's adaptivity and performance in multiple scenarios characterized by different requirements in terms of power and workspace. CONCERT has been designed and built by the Humanoid and Human-Centered Mechatronics Laboratory (HHCM) at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in the context of the European Project Horizon 2020 CONCERT.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is currently under review at the Journal of Field Robotics.

| **[BayesCPF: Enabling Collective Perception in Robot Swarms with Degrading Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04774v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The collective perception problem -- where a group of robots perceives its surroundings and comes to a consensus on an environmental state -- is a fundamental problem in swarm robotics. Past works studying collective perception use either an entire robot swarm with perfect sensing or a swarm with only a handful of malfunctioning members. A related study proposed an algorithm that does account for an entire swarm of unreliable robots but assumes that the sensor faults are known and remain constant over time. To that end, we build on that study by proposing the Bayes Collective Perception Filter (BayesCPF) that enables robots with continuously degrading sensors to accurately estimate the fill ratio -- the rate at which an environmental feature occurs. Our main contribution is the Extended Kalman Filter within the BayesCPF, which helps swarm robots calibrate for their time-varying sensor degradation. We validate our method across different degradation models, initial conditions, and environments in simulated and physical experiments. Our findings show that, regardless of degradation model assumptions, fill ratio estimation using the BayesCPF is competitive to the case if the true sensor accuracy is known, especially when assumptions regarding the model and initial sensor accuracy levels are preserved.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Extended URDF: Accounting for parallel mechanism in robot description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04767v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic designs played an important role in recent advances by providing powerful robots with complex mechanics. Many recent systems rely on parallel actuation to provide lighter limbs and allow more complex motion. However, these emerging architectures fall outside the scope of most used description formats, leading to difficulties when designing, storing, and sharing the models of these systems. This paper introduces an extension to the widely used Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) to support closed-loop kinematic structures. Our approach relies on augmenting URDF with minimal additional information to allow more efficient modeling of complex robotic systems while maintaining compatibility with existing design and simulation frameworks. This method sets the basic requirement for a description format to handle parallel mechanisms efficiently. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by providing an open-source collection of parallel robots, along with tools for generating and parsing this extended description format. The proposed extension simplifies robot modeling, reduces redundancy, and improves usability for advanced robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing data collection methods like teleoperation are slow, prone to control delays, and unsuitable for dynamic tasks. In contrast, human natural data, where humans directly perform tasks with tools, offers natural, unstructured interactions that are both efficient and easy to collect. Building on the insight that humans and robots can share the same tools, we propose a framework to transfer tool-use knowledge from human data to robots. Using two RGB cameras, our method generates 3D reconstruction, applies Gaussian splatting for novel view augmentation, employs segmentation models to extract embodiment-agnostic observations, and leverages task-space tool-action representations to train visuomotor policies. We validate our approach on diverse real-world tasks, including meatball scooping, pan flipping, wine bottle balancing, and other complex tasks. Our method achieves a 71\% higher average success rate compared to diffusion policies trained with teleoperation data and reduces data collection time by 77\%, with some tasks solvable only by our framework. Compared to hand-held gripper, our method cuts data collection time by 41\%. Additionally, our method bridges the embodiment gap, improves robustness to variations in camera viewpoints and robot configurations, and generalizes effectively across objects and spatial setups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tool-as-interface.github.io. 17 pages, 14 figures</p></details> |

We consider the scenario where real-time perception feedback (e.g., LiDAR) is used online to construct a local CBF that models local state constraints (e.g., local safety constraints such as obstacles) in the a priori unmapped environment. The approach employs a soft-maximum function to synthesize a single time-varying CBF from the N most recently obtained local CBFs. Next, the input constraints are transformed into controller-state constraints through the use of control dynamics. Then, we use a soft-minimum function to compose the input constraints with the time-varying CBF that models the a priori unmapped environment. This composition yields a single relaxed CBF, which is used in a constrained optimization to obtain an optimal control that satisfies the state and input constraints. The approach is validated through simulations of a nonholonomic ground robot that is equipped with LiDAR and navigates an unmapped environment. The robot successfully navigates the environment while avoiding the a priori unmapped obstacles and satisfying both speed and input constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>The P...</summary><p>The Preprint was submitted to the 2025 Conference on Decision and Control (CDC). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.01458</p></details> |

Traditional wall-climbing systems typically rely on electromagnetic, electrostatic, vacuum suction, or van der Waals forces for controllable adhesion. However, these conventional methods impose limitations when striving for both a compact design and high-speed mobility. This paper proposes a novel Vibration-Based Adhesion (VBA) technique, which utilizes a flexible disk vibrating near a surface to generate a strong and controllable attractive force without direct contact. By employing an electric motor as the vibration source, the constructed VBA system was experimentally evaluated, achieving an adhesion-to-weight ratio exceeding 51 times. The experimental results demonstrate that this adhesion mechanism not only provides a high normal force but also maintains minimal shear force, making it particularly suitable for high-speed movement and heavy load applications in miniature wall-climbing robots.</p></details> |  |

However, the limited scale and diversity of robot demonstration data pose a significant challenge. Recent research has explored leveraging large-scale human activity data for pre-training, but the substantial morphological differences between humans and robots introduce a significant human-robot domain discrepancy, hindering the generalization of these models to downstream manipulation tasks. To overcome this, we propose a novel adaptation paradigm that leverages readily available paired human-robot video data to bridge the domain gap. Our method employs a human-robot contrastive alignment loss to align the semantics of human and robot videos, adapting pre-trained models to the robot domain in a parameter-efficient manner. Experiments on 20 simulated tasks across two different benchmarks and five real-world tasks demonstrate significant improvements. These results span both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task settings, evaluated using two different pre-trained models. Compared to existing pre-trained models, our adaptation method improves the average success rate by over 7% across multiple tasks on both simulated benchmarks and real-world evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025.

A human-like form factor further enables the use of vast datasets of human-hand interactions. However, the primary bottleneck in dexterous manipulation lies not only in software but arguably even more in hardware. Robotic hands that approach human capabilities are often prohibitively expensive, bulky, or require enterprise-level maintenance, limiting their accessibility for broader research and practical applications. What if the research community could get started with reliable dexterous hands within a day? We present the open-source ORCA hand, a reliable and anthropomorphic 17-DoF tendon-driven robotic hand with integrated tactile sensors, fully assembled in less than eight hours and built for a material cost below 2,000 CHF. We showcase ORCA's key design features such as popping joints, auto-calibration, and tensioning systems that significantly reduce complexity while increasing reliability, accuracy, and robustness. We benchmark the ORCA hand across a variety of tasks, ranging from teleoperation and imitation learning to zero-shot sim-to-real reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate its durability, withstanding more than 10,000 continuous operation cycles - equivalent to approximately 20 hours - without hardware failure, the only constraint being the duration of the experiment itself.

| **[Risk-Aware Robot Control in Dynamic Environments Using Belief Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04097v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety for autonomous robots operating in dynamic environments can be challenging due to factors such as unmodeled dynamics, noisy sensor measurements, and partial observability. To account for these limitations, it is common to maintain a belief distribution over the true state. This belief could be a non-parametric, sample-based representation to capture uncertainty more flexibly. In this paper, we propose a novel form of Belief Control Barrier Functions (BCBFs) specifically designed to ensure safety in dynamic environments under stochastic dynamics and a sample-based belief about the environment state. Our approach incorporates provable concentration bounds on tail risk measures into BCBFs, effectively addressing possible multimodal and skewed belief distributions represented by samples. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates robustness against distributional shifts up to a predefined bound. We validate the effectiveness and real-time performance (approximately 1kHz) of the proposed method through two simulated underwater robotic applications: object tracking and dynamic collision avoidance.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboSpatial: Teaching Spatial Understanding to 2D and 3D Vision-Language Models for Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16537v4)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial understanding is a crucial capability that enables robots to perceive their surroundings, reason about their environment, and interact with it meaningfully. In modern robotics, these capabilities are increasingly provided by vision-language models. However, these models face significant challenges in spatial reasoning tasks, as their training data are based on general-purpose image datasets that often lack sophisticated spatial understanding. For example, datasets frequently do not capture reference frame comprehension, yet effective spatial reasoning requires understanding whether to reason from ego-, world-, or object-centric perspectives. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale dataset for spatial understanding in robotics. It consists of real indoor and tabletop scenes, captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, and annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5k 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, and the pairing of 2D egocentric images with 3D scans makes it both 2D- and 3D- ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robot manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (Oral); Project Website: https://chanh.ee/RoboSpatial</p></details> |

Traditional exploration strategies, such as frontier-based methods, often struggle to efficiently utilize prior knowledge of structural regularities in indoor spaces. To address this limitation, we propose Mapping at First Sense, a lightweight neural network-based approach that predicts unobserved areas in local maps, thereby enhancing exploration efficiency. The core of our method, SenseMapNet, integrates convolutional and transformerbased architectures to infer occluded regions while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time deployment on resourceconstrained robots. Additionally, we introduce SenseMapDataset, a curated dataset constructed from KTH and HouseExpo environments, which facilitates training and evaluation of neural models for indoor exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that SenseMapNet achieves an SSIM (structural similarity) of 0.78, LPIPS (perceptual quality) of 0.68, and an FID (feature distribution alignment) of 239.79, outperforming conventional methods in map reconstruction quality. Compared to traditional frontier-based exploration, our method reduces exploration time by 46.5% (from 2335.56s to 1248.68s) while maintaining a high coverage rate (88%) and achieving a reconstruction accuracy of 88%. The proposed method represents a promising step toward efficient, learning-driven robotic exploration in structured environments.</p></details> |  |

However, retinal motion caused by physiological factors such as respiration and heartbeat significantly impacts precise needle positioning, increasing the risk of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) damage. This paper presents a fully autonomous robotic subretinal injection system that integrates intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) imaging and deep learning-based motion prediction to synchronize needle motion with retinal displacement. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is used to predict internal limiting membrane (ILM) motion, outperforming a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based baseline model. Additionally, a real-time registration framework aligns the needle tip position with the robot's coordinate frame. Then, a dynamic proportional speed control strategy ensures smooth and adaptive needle insertion. Experimental validation in both simulation and ex vivo open-sky porcine eyes demonstrates precise motion synchronization and successful subretinal injections. The experiment achieves a mean tracking error below 16.4 {\mu}m in pre-insertion phases. These results show the potential of AI-driven robotic assistance to improve the safety and accuracy of retinal microsurgery.</p></details> |  |

To enable successful robot operation in such settings, maps must be constructed so that they include semantic information, in addition to geometric information. In this paper, we address the novel problem of semantic exploration, whereby a mobile robot must autonomously explore an environment to fully map both its structure and the semantic appearance of features. We develop a method based on next-best-view exploration, where potential poses are scored based on the semantic features visible from that pose. We explore two alternative methods for sampling potential views and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulation and physical experiments. Automatic creation of high-quality semantic maps can enable robots to better understand and interact with their environments and enable future embodied AI applications to be more easily deployed.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, accurately assessing training performance remains challenging, particularly for real-world applications, as behavior cloning losses often correlate poorly with actual task success. Consequently, researchers resort to success rate metrics derived from costly and time-consuming real-world evaluations, making the identification of optimal policies and detection of overfitting or underfitting impractical. To address these issues, we propose real-is-sim, a novel behavior cloning framework that incorporates a dynamic digital twin (based on Embodied Gaussians) throughout the entire policy development pipeline: data collection, training, and deployment. By continuously aligning the simulated world with the physical world, demonstrations can be collected in the real world with states extracted from the simulator. The simulator enables flexible state representations by rendering image inputs from any viewpoint or extracting low-level state information from objects embodied within the scene. During training, policies can be directly evaluated within the simulator in an offline and highly parallelizable manner. Finally, during deployment, policies are run within the simulator where the real robot directly tracks the simulated robot's joints, effectively decoupling policy execution from real hardware and mitigating traditional domain-transfer challenges. We validate real-is-sim on the PushT manipulation task, demonstrating strong correlation between success rates obtained in the simulator and real-world evaluations. Videos of our system can be found at https://realissim.rai-inst.com.</p></details> |  |

However, human oversight remains crucial. This study compared two touchless methods for directing mobile robots: voice control and gesture control, to investigate the efficiency of the methods and the preference of users. We tested these methods in two conditions: one in which participants remained stationary and one in which they walked freely alongside the robot. We hypothesized that walking alongside the robot would result in higher intuitiveness ratings and improved task performance, based on the idea that walking promotes spatial alignment and reduces the effort required for mental rotation. In a 2x2 within-subject design, 218 participants guided the quadruped robot Spot along a circuitous route with multiple 90-degree turns using rotate left, rotate right, and walk forward commands. After each trial, participants rated the intuitiveness of the command mapping, while post-experiment interviews were used to gather the participants' preferences. Results showed that voice control combined with walking with Spot was the most favored and intuitive, whereas gesture control while standing caused confusion for left/right commands. Nevertheless, 29% of participants preferred gesture control, citing increased task engagement and visual congruence as reasons. An odometry-based analysis revealed that participants often followed behind Spot, particularly in the gesture control condition, when they were allowed to walk. In conclusion, voice control with walking produced the best outcomes. Improving physical ergonomics and adjusting gesture types could make gesture control more effective.</p></details> |  |

For pediatric or elderly individuals, whose vessels are small in size (typically 2 to 3 mm in diameter for adults and less than 1 mm in children), vascular access can be highly challenging. This study presents an image-guided robotic system aimed at enhancing the accuracy of difficult vascular access procedures. The system integrates a 6-DoF robotic arm with a 3-DoF end-effector, ensuring precise navigation and needle insertion. Multi-modal imaging and sensing technologies have been utilized to endow the medical robot with precision and safety, while ultrasound imaging guidance is specifically evaluated in this study. To evaluate in vivo vascular access in submillimeter vessels, we conducted ultrasound-guided robotic blood drawing on the tail veins (with a diameter of 0.7 plus or minus 0.2 mm) of 40 rats. The results demonstrate that the system achieved a first-attempt success rate of 95 percent. The high first-attempt success rate in intravenous vascular access, even with small blood vessels, demonstrates the system's effectiveness in performing these procedures. This capability reduces the risk of failed attempts, minimizes patient discomfort, and enhances clinical efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Robot Localization Using a Learned Keypoint Detector and Descriptor with a Floor Camera and a Feature Rich Industrial Floor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03249v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The localization of moving robots depends on the availability of good features from the environment. Sensor systems like Lidar are popular, but unique features can also be extracted from images of the ground. This work presents the Keypoint Localization Framework (KOALA), which utilizes deep neural networks that extract sufficient features from an industrial floor for accurate localization without having readable markers. For this purpose, we use a floor covering that can be produced as cheaply as common industrial floors. Although we do not use any filtering, prior, or temporal information, we can estimate our position in 75.7 % of all images with a mean position error of 2 cm and a rotation error of 2.4 %. Thus, the robot kidnapping problem can be solved with high precision in every frame, even while the robot is moving. Furthermore, we show that our framework with our detector and descriptor combination is able to outperform comparable approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) systems relying on gestures or verbal commands are impractical for the elderly due to difficulties with complex syntax or sign language. To address the challenge, this paper introduces a multi-modal interaction framework that combines voice and deictic posture information to create a more natural HRI system. The visual cues are first processed by the object detection model to gain a global understanding of the environment, and then bounding boxes are estimated based on depth information. By using a large language model (LLM) with voice-to-text commands and temporally aligned selected bounding boxes, robot action sequences can be generated, while key control syntax constraints are applied to avoid potential LLM hallucination issues. The system is evaluated on real-world tasks with varying levels of complexity using a Universal Robots UR3e manipulator. Our method demonstrates significantly better performance in HRI in terms of accuracy and robustness. To benefit the research community and the general public, we will make our code and design open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine</p></details> |

An Empirical Evaluation for Vision-Language Understanding in Robotic-Assisted Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23130v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The DeepSeek models have shown exceptional performance in general scene understanding, question-answering (QA), and text generation tasks, owing to their efficient training paradigm and strong reasoning capabilities. In this study, we investigate the dialogue capabilities of the DeepSeek model in robotic surgery scenarios, focusing on tasks such as Single Phrase QA, Visual QA, and Detailed Description. The Single Phrase QA tasks further include sub-tasks such as surgical instrument recognition, action understanding, and spatial position analysis. We conduct extensive evaluations using publicly available datasets, including EndoVis18 and CholecT50, along with their corresponding dialogue data. Our empirical study shows that, compared to existing general-purpose multimodal large language models, DeepSeek-VL2 performs better on complex understanding tasks in surgical scenes. Additionally, although DeepSeek-V3 is purely a language model, we find that when image tokens are directly inputted, the model demonstrates better performance on single-sentence QA tasks. However, overall, the DeepSeek models still fall short of meeting the clinical requirements for understanding surgical scenes. Under general prompts, DeepSeek models lack the ability to effectively analyze global surgical concepts and fail to provide detailed insights into surgical scenarios. Based on our observations, we argue that the DeepSeek models are not ready for vision-language tasks in surgical contexts without fine-tuning on surgery-specific datasets.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Distributed Resilience-Aware Control in Multi-Robot Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03120v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring resilient consensus in multi-robot systems with misbehaving agents remains a challenge, as many existing network resilience properties are inherently combinatorial and globally defined. While previous works have proposed control laws to enhance or preserve resilience in multi-robot networks, they often assume a fixed topology with known resilience properties, or require global state knowledge. These assumptions may be impractical in physically-constrained environments, where safety and resilience requirements are conflicting, or when misbehaving agents corrupt the shared information. In this work, we propose a distributed control law that enables each robot to guarantee resilient consensus and safety during its navigation without fixed topologies using only locally available information. To this end, we establish a new sufficient condition for resilient consensus in time-varying networks based on the degree of non-misbehaving or normal agents. Using this condition, we design a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based controller that guarantees resilient consensus and collision avoidance without requiring estimates of global state and/or control actions of all other robots. Finally, we validate our method through simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) 2025</p></details> |

However, most prior LLM-based work in robotic applications either directly predicts waypoints or applies LLMs within fixed tool integration frameworks, offering limited flexibility in exploring and configuring solutions best suited to different tasks. In this work, we propose a framework that leverages LLMs to select appropriate planning and control strategies based on task descriptions, environmental constraints, and system dynamics. These strategies are then executed by calling the available comprehensive planning and control APIs. Our approach employs iterative LLM-based reasoning with performance feedback to refine the algorithm selection. We validate our approach through extensive experiments across tasks of varying complexity, from simple tracking to complex planning scenarios involving spatiotemporal constraints. The results demonstrate that using LLMs to determine planning and control strategies from natural language descriptions significantly enhances robotic autonomy while reducing the need for extensive manual tuning and expert knowledge. Furthermore, our framework maintains generalizability across different tasks and notably outperforms baseline methods that rely on LLMs for direct trajectory, control sequence, or code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 14 figures, submitted for CDC 2025 invited session on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Control</p></details> |

Social robots may offer a promising avenue for emotional support, especially when considering the ongoing advancements in conversational AI. This study investigates how repeated interactions with a social robot influence feelings of loneliness and perceived stress, and how such feelings are reflected in the themes of user disclosures towards the robot. Participants engaged in a five-session robot-led intervention, where a large language model powered QTrobot facilitated structured conversations designed to support cognitive reappraisal. Results from linear mixed-effects models show significant reductions in both loneliness and perceived stress over time. Additionally, semantic clustering of 560 user disclosures towards the robot revealed six distinct conversational themes. Results from a Kruskal-Wallis H-test demonstrate that participants reporting higher loneliness and stress more frequently engaged in socially focused disclosures, such as friendship and connection, whereas lower distress was associated with introspective and goal-oriented themes (e.g., academic ambitions). By exploring both how the intervention affects well-being, as well as how well-being shapes the content of robot-directed conversations, we aim to capture the dynamic nature of emotional support in huma-robot interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Laws in Scientific Discovery with AI and Robot Scientists](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22444v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific discovery is poised for rapid advancement through advanced robotics and artificial intelligence. Current scientific practices face substantial limitations as manual experimentation remains time-consuming and resource-intensive, while multidisciplinary research demands knowledge integration beyond individual researchers' expertise boundaries. Here, we envision an autonomous generalist scientist (AGS) concept combines agentic AI and embodied robotics to automate the entire research lifecycle. This system could dynamically interact with both physical and virtual environments while facilitating the integration of knowledge across diverse scientific disciplines. By deploying these technologies throughout every research stage -- spanning literature review, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript writing -- and incorporating internal reflection alongside external feedback, this system aims to significantly reduce the time and resources needed for scientific discovery. Building on the evolution from virtual AI scientists to versatile generalist AI-based robot scientists, AGS promises groundbreaking potential. As these autonomous systems become increasingly integrated into the research process, we hypothesize that scientific discovery might adhere to new scaling laws, potentially shaped by the number and capabilities of these autonomous systems, offering novel perspectives on how knowledge is generated and evolves. The adaptability of embodied robots to extreme environments, paired with the flywheel effect of accumulating scientific knowledge, holds the promise of continually pushing beyond both physical and intellectual frontiers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified World Models: Coupling Video and Action Diffusion for Pretraining on Large Robotic Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02792v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building generalist robots. However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation required for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

For instance, based on common sense knowledge, a household robot can predict that it should avoid vacuuming during a social gathering, but it may still be uncertain whether it should vacuum before or after having guests. In such cases, integrating common-sense knowledge with human preferences, often conveyed through human explanations, is fundamental yet a challenge for existing systems. In this paper, we introduce GRACE, a novel approach addressing this while generating socially appropriate robot actions. GRACE leverages common sense knowledge from LLMs, and it integrates this knowledge with human explanations through a generative network. The bidirectional structure of GRACE enables robots to refine and enhance LLM predictions by utilizing human explanations and makes robots capable of generating such explanations for human-specified actions. Our evaluations show that integrating human explanations boosts GRACE's performance, where it outperforms several baselines and provides sensible explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA), Supplementary video: https://youtu.be/GTNCC1GkiQ4</p></details> |
| **[Robot-Led Vision Language Model Wellbeing Assessment of Children](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02765v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a novel robot-led approach to assessing children's mental wellbeing using a Vision Language Model (VLM). Inspired by the Child Apperception Test (CAT), the social robot NAO presented children with pictorial stimuli to elicit their verbal narratives of the images, which were then evaluated by a VLM in accordance with CAT assessment guidelines. The VLM's assessments were systematically compared to those provided by a trained psychologist. The results reveal that while the VLM demonstrates moderate reliability in identifying cases with no wellbeing concerns, its ability to accurately classify assessments with clinical concern remains limited. Moreover, although the model's performance was generally consistent when prompted with varying demographic factors such as age and gender, a significantly higher false positive rate was observed for girls, indicating potential sensitivity to gender attribute. These findings highlight both the promise and the challenges of integrating VLMs into robot-led assessments of children's wellbeing.</p></details> |  |

The architecture and connectivity of the MI-HGNN are constructed from the robot morphology, in which nodes and edges are robot joints and links, respectively. By incorporating the morphology-informed constraints into a neural network, we improve a learning-based approach using model-based knowledge. We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness, generalization ability, model efficiency, and sample efficiency. Our MI-HGNN improved the performance of a state-of-the-art model that leverages robot morphological symmetry by 8.4% with only 0.21% of its parameters. Although MI-HGNN is applied to contact perception problems for legged robots in this work, it can be seamlessly applied to other types of multi-body dynamical systems and has the potential to improve other robot learning frameworks.

In this work, we propose to create autonomous interactive robots, by training a model to imitate operator data. Our model is trained on a dataset of human-robot interactions, where an expert operator is asked to vary the interactions and mood of the robot, while the operator commands as well as the pose of the human and robot are recorded. Our approach learns to predict continuous operator commands through a diffusion process and discrete commands through a classifier, all unified within a single transformer architecture. We evaluate the resulting model in simulation and with a user study on the real system. We show that our method enables simple autonomous human-robot interactions that are comparable to the expert-operator baseline, and that users can recognize the different robot moods as generated by our model. Finally, we demonstrate a zero-shot transfer of our model onto a different robotic platform with the same operator interface.</p></details> |  |
| **[Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System and Edge Computing Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02492v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a complex environment, for a mobile robot to safely and collision - free avoid all obstacles, it poses high requirements for its intelligence level. Given that the information such as the position and geometric characteristics of obstacles is random, the control parameters of the robot, such as velocity and angular velocity, are also prone to random deviations. To address this issue in the framework of the Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System, this paper proposes a global path control scheme for mobile robots based on deep learning. First of all, the dynamic equation of the mobile robot is established. According to the linear velocity and angular velocity of the mobile robot, its motion behaviors are divided into obstacle - avoidance behavior, target - turning behavior, and target approaching behavior. Subsequently, the neural network method in deep learning is used to build a global path planning model for the robot. On this basis, a fuzzy controller is designed with the help of a fuzzy control algorithm to correct the deviations that occur during path planning, thereby achieving optimized control of the robot's global path. In addition, considering edge computing optimization, the proposed model can process local data at the edge device, reducing the communication burden between the robot and the central server, and improving the real time performance of path planning. The experimental results show that for the mobile robot controlled by the research method in this paper, the deviation distance of the path angle is within 5 cm, the deviation convergence can be completed within 10 ms, and the planned path is shorter. This indicates that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the global path planning ability of mobile robots in the industrial Internet environment and promote the collaborative operation of robots through edge computing optimization.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present an approach for scene flow estimation from low-density and noisy point clouds acquired from miniaturized Time of Flight (ToF) sensors distributed on the robot body. The proposed method clusters points from consecutive frames and applies Iterative Closest Point (ICP) to estimate a dense motion flow, with additional steps introduced to mitigate the impact of sensor noise and low-density data points. Specifically, we employ a fitness-based classification to distinguish between stationary and moving points and an inlier removal strategy to refine geometric correspondences. The proposed approach is validated in an experimental setup where 24 ToF are used to estimate the velocity of an object moving at different controlled speeds. Experimental results show that the method consistently approximates the direction of the motion and its magnitude with an error which is in line with sensor noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

Traditional methods primarily optimize geometric fidelity or rendering accuracy, but often overlook operator-specific objectives, such as safety-critical coverage or task-driven viewpoints. This limitation leads to suboptimal viewpoint selection, particularly in constrained environments such as nuclear decommissioning. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework that integrates expert operator preferences into the active 3D scene representation pipeline. Specifically, we employ Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to guide robotic path planning, reshaping the reward function based on expert input. To capture operator-specific priorities, we conduct interactive choice experiments that evaluate user preferences in 3D scene representation. We validate our framework using a UR3e robotic arm for reactor tile inspection in a nuclear decommissioning scenario. Compared to baseline methods, our approach enhances scene representation while optimizing trajectory efficiency. The RLHF-based policy consistently outperforms random selection, prioritizing task-critical details. By unifying explicit 3D geometric modeling with implicit human-in-the-loop optimization, this work establishes a foundation for adaptive, safety-critical robotic perception systems, paving the way for enhanced automation in nuclear decommissioning, remote maintenance, and other high-risk environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

Previous work on topic management in conversational agents has predominantly focused on human engagement and topic personalization, with the agent having an active role in the discussion. Also, studies have shown the usefulness of including robots in groups, yet further exploration is still needed for robots to learn when to change the topic while facilitating discussions. Accordingly, our work investigates the suitability of machine-learning models and audiovisual non-verbal features in predicting appropriate topic changes. We utilized interactions between a robot moderator and human participants, which we annotated and used for extracting acoustic and body language-related features. We provide a detailed analysis of the performance of machine learning approaches using sequential and non-sequential data with different sets of features. The results indicate promising performance in classifying inappropriate topic changes, outperforming rule-based approaches.

Evaluations are critical to assess progress and build better policies, but evaluation in the real world, especially at a scale that would provide statistically reliable results, is costly in terms of human time and hard to obtain. Evaluation of increasingly generalist robot policies requires an increasingly diverse repertoire of evaluation environments, making the evaluation bottleneck even more pronounced. To make real-world evaluation of robotic policies more practical, we propose AutoEval, a system to autonomously evaluate generalist robot policies around the clock with minimal human intervention. Users interact with AutoEval by submitting evaluation jobs to the AutoEval queue, much like how software jobs are submitted with a cluster scheduling system, and AutoEval will schedule the policies for evaluation within a framework supplying automatic success detection and automatic scene resets. We show that AutoEval can nearly fully eliminate human involvement in the evaluation process, permitting around the clock evaluations, and the evaluation results correspond closely to ground truth evaluations conducted by hand. To facilitate the evaluation of generalist policies in the robotics community, we provide public access to multiple AutoEval scenes in the popular BridgeData robot setup with WidowX robot arms. In the future, we hope that AutoEval scenes can be set up across institutions to form a diverse and distributed evaluation network.</p></details> |  |

However, existing open-source VLMs predominantly trained for generic vision-language alignment tasks fail to model temporally correlated action semantics that are crucial for robotic manipulation effectively. While current image-based fine-tuning methods partially adapt VLMs to robotic applications, they fundamentally disregard temporal evolution patterns in video sequences and suffer from visual feature entanglement between robotic agents, manipulated objects, and environmental contexts, thereby limiting semantic decoupling capability for atomic actions and compromising model generalizability.To overcome these challenges, this work presents RoboAct-CLIP with dual technical contributions: 1) A dataset reconstruction framework that performs semantic-constrained action unit segmentation and re-annotation on open-source robotic videos, constructing purified training sets containing singular atomic actions (e.g., "grasp"); 2) A temporal-decoupling fine-tuning strategy based on Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) architecture, which disentangles temporal action features across video frames from object-centric characteristics to achieve hierarchical representation learning of robotic atomic actions.Experimental results in simulated environments demonstrate that the RoboAct-CLIP pretrained model achieves a 12% higher success rate than baseline VLMs, along with superior generalization in multi-object manipulation tasks.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |

Extending the robot skillset to novel tasks involves gathering an extensive amount of training data for additional tasks. In this paper, we address the problem of teaching new tasks to robots using human demonstration videos for repetitive tasks (e.g., packing). This task requires understanding the human video to identify which object is being manipulated (the pick object) and where it is being placed (the placement slot). In addition, it needs to re-identify the pick object and the placement slots during inference along with the relative poses to enable robot execution of the task. To tackle this, we propose SLeRP, a modular system that leverages several advanced visual foundation models and a novel slot-level placement detector Slot-Net, eliminating the need for expensive video demonstrations for training. We evaluate our system using a new benchmark of real-world videos. The evaluation results show that SLeRP outperforms several baselines and can be deployed on a real robot.</p></details> |  |

| **[Sim-and-Real Co-Training: A Simple Recipe for Vision-Based Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24361v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large real-world robot datasets hold great potential to train generalist robot models, but scaling real-world human data collection is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Simulation has great potential in supplementing large-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and automated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior datasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it to the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality gap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of simulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown this strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one trained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community lacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes to reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work presents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve vision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from comprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various simulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a humanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance real-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences between the simulation and real-world data.

| **[A Tutorial on Distributed Optimization for Cooperative Robotics: from Setups and Algorithms to Toolboxes and Research Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04257v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several interesting problems in multi-robot systems can be cast in the framework of distributed optimization. Examples include multi-robot task allocation, vehicle routing, target protection, and surveillance. While the theoretical analysis of distributed optimization algorithms has received significant attention, its application to cooperative robotics has not been investigated in detail. In this paper, we show how notable scenarios in cooperative robotics can be addressed by suitable distributed optimization setups. Specifically, after a brief introduction on the widely investigated consensus optimization (most suited for data analytics) and on the partition-based setup (matching the graph structure in the optimization), we focus on two distributed settings modeling several scenarios in cooperative robotics, i.e., the so-called constraint-coupled and aggregative optimization frameworks. For each one, we consider use-case applications, and we discuss tailored distributed algorithms with their convergence properties. Then, we revise state-of-the-art toolboxes allowing for the implementation of distributed schemes on real networks of robots without central coordinators. For each use case, we discuss its implementation in these toolboxes and provide simulations and real experiments on networks of heterogeneous robots.</p></details> |  |

Data was gathered from an operational fish farm and includes data from sensors such as the Waterlinked A50 DVL, the Nortek Nucleus 1000 DVL, Sonardyne Micro Ranger 2 USBL, Sonoptix Mulitbeam Sonar, mono and stereo cameras, and vehicle sensor data such as power usage, IMU, pressure, temperature, and more. Data acquisition is performed during both manual and autonomous traversal of the net pen structure. The collected vision data is of undamaged nets with some fish and marine growth presence, and it is expected that both the research community and the aquaculture industry will benefit greatly from the utilization of the proposed SOLAQUA dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prior Lessons of Incremental Dialogue and Robot Action Management for the Age of Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00953v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efforts towards endowing robots with the ability to speak have benefited from recent advancements in natural language processing, in particular large language models. However, current language models are not fully incremental, as their processing is inherently monotonic and thus lack the ability to revise their interpretations or output in light of newer observations. This monotonicity has important implications for the development of dialogue systems for human--robot interaction. In this paper, we review the literature on interactive systems that operate incrementally (i.e., at the word level or below it). We motivate the need for incremental systems, survey incremental modeling of important aspects of dialogue like speech recognition and language generation. Primary focus is on the part of the system that makes decisions, known as the dialogue manager. We find that there is very little research on incremental dialogue management, offer some requirements for practical incremental dialogue management, and the implications of incremental dialogue for embodied, robotic platforms in the age of large language models.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[A Model-Agnostic Approach for Semantically Driven Disambiguation in Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17004v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambiguities are inevitable in human-robot interaction, especially when a robot follows user instructions in a large, shared space. For example, if a user asks the robot to find an object in a home environment with underspecified instructions, the object could be in multiple locations depending on missing factors. For instance, a bowl might be in the kitchen cabinet or on the dining room table, depending on whether it is clean or dirty, full or empty, and the presence of other objects around it. Previous works on object search have assumed that the queried object is immediately visible to the robot or have predicted object locations using one-shot inferences, which are likely to fail for ambiguous or partially understood instructions. This paper focuses on these gaps and presents a novel model-agnostic approach leveraging semantically driven clarifications to enhance the robot's ability to locate queried objects in fewer attempts. Specifically, we leverage different knowledge embedding models, and when ambiguities arise, we propose an informative clarification method, which follows an iterative prediction process. The user experiment evaluation of our method shows that our approach is applicable to different custom semantic encoders as well as LLMs, and informative clarifications improve performances, enabling the robot to locate objects on its first attempts. The user experiment data is publicly available at https://github.com/IrmakDogan/ExpressionDataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robot & Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN), Supplementary video: https://youtu.be/_P0v07Xc24Y, Dataset publicly available: https://github.com/IrmakDogan/ExpressionDataset</p></details> |
| **[TransforMerger: Transformer-based Voice-Gesture Fusion for Robust Human-Robot Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01708v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As human-robot collaboration advances, natural and flexible communication methods are essential for effective robot control. Traditional methods relying on a single modality or rigid rules struggle with noisy or misaligned data as well as with object descriptions that do not perfectly fit the predefined object names (e.g. 'Pick that red object'). We introduce TransforMerger, a transformer-based reasoning model that infers a structured action command for robotic manipulation based on fused voice and gesture inputs. Our approach merges multimodal data into a single unified sentence, which is then processed by the language model. We employ probabilistic embeddings to handle uncertainty and we integrate contextual scene understanding to resolve ambiguous references (e.g., gestures pointing to multiple objects or vague verbal cues like "this"). We evaluate TransforMerger in simulated and real-world experiments, demonstrating its robustness to noise, misalignment, and missing information. Our results show that TransforMerger outperforms deterministic baselines, especially in scenarios requiring more contextual knowledge, enabling more robust and flexible human-robot communication. Code and datasets are available at: http://imitrob.ciirc.cvut.cz/publications/transformerger.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Previous efforts have focused on responding to spontaneous electro-mechanical faults and failures. However, many faults occur gradually over time. Waiting until such faults have manifested as failures before addressing them is both inefficient and unsustainable in a variety of scenarios. This work argues that the principles of predictive maintenance, in which potential faults are resolved before they hinder the operation of the swarm, offer a promising means of achieving long-term fault tolerance. This is a novel approach to swarm fault tolerance, which is shown to give a comparable or improved performance when tested against a reactive approach in almost all cases tested.</p></details> |  |
| **[8-DoFs Cable Driven Parallel Robots for Bimanual Teleportation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01554v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teleoperation plays a critical role in intuitive robot control and imitation learning, particularly for complex tasks involving mobile manipulators with redundant degrees of freedom (DoFs). However, most existing master controllers are limited to 6-DoF spatial control and basic gripper control, making them insufficient for controlling high-DoF robots and restricting the operator to a small workspace. In this work, we present a novel, low-cost, high-DoF master controller based on Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs), designed to overcome these limitations. The system decouples translation and orientation control, following a scalable 3 + 3 + n DoF structure: 3 DoFs for large-range translation using a CDPR, 3 DoFs for orientation using a gimbal mechanism, and n additional DoFs for gripper and redundant joint control. Its lightweight cable-driven design enables a large and adaptable workspace while minimizing actuator load. The end-effector remains stable without requiring continuous high-torque input, unlike most serial robot arms. We developed the first dual-arm CDPR-based master controller using cost-effective actuators and a simple mechanical structure. In demonstrations, the system successfully controlled an 8-DoF robotic arm with a 2-DoF pan-tilt camera, performing tasks such as pick-and-place, knot tying, object sorting, and tape application. The results show precise, versatile, and practical high-DoF teleoperation.</p></details> |  |

Some examples include fern shoots, prehensile tails, and soft limbs like octopus arms and elephant trunks. In the latter cases, spiraling is also used for grasping. Motivated by how this strategy simplifies behavior into kinematic primitives and combines them to develop smart grasping movements, this work focuses on the elephant trunk, which is more deeply investigated in the literature. We present a soft arm combined with a rigid robotic system to replicate elephant grasping capabilities based on the combination of a soft trunk with a solid body. In our system, the rigid arm ensures positioning and orientation, mimicking the role of the elephant's head, while the soft manipulator reproduces trunk motion primitives of bending and twisting under proper actuation patterns. This synergy replicates 9 distinct elephant grasping strategies reported in the literature, accommodating objects of varying shapes and sizes. The synergistic interaction between the rigid and soft components of the system minimizes the control complexity while maintaining a high degree of adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 1. 16 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

The proposed framework addresses challenges in nuclear waste handling tasks, which often involve repetitive and meticulous manipulation operations. By capturing operator movements and manipulation forces during teleoperation, the framework utilizes this data to train machine learning models capable of replicating and generalizing human skills. We validate the effectiveness of the LfT framework through its application to a power plug insertion task, selected as a representative scenario that is repetitive yet requires precise trajectory and force control. Experimental results highlight significant improvements in task efficiency, while reducing reliance on continuous operator involvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Waste...</summary><p>Waste Management Symposia 2025</p></details> |

In contrast, lighter-than-air flapping-wing robots, inspired by animal movement, offer a soft, quiet, and touch-safe alternative. Building on these advantages, we present \textit{Cuddle-Fish}, a soft, flapping-wing floating robot designed for safe, close-proximity interactions in indoor spaces. Through a user study with 24 participants, we explored their perceptions of the robot and experiences during a series of co-located demonstrations in which the robot moved near them. Results showed that participants felt safe, willingly engaged in touch-based interactions with the robot, and exhibited spontaneous affective behaviours, such as patting, stroking, hugging, and cheek-touching, without external prompting. They also reported positive emotional responses towards the robot. These findings suggest that the soft floating robot with flapping wings can serve as a novel and socially acceptable alternative to traditional rigid flying robots, opening new possibilities for companionship, play, and interactive experiences in everyday indoor environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Social Life of Industrial Arms: How Arousal and Attention Shape Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01260v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores how human perceptions of a non-anthropomorphic robotic manipulator are shaped by two key dimensions of behaviour: arousal, defined as the robot's movement energy and expressiveness, and attention, defined as the robot's capacity to selectively orient toward and engage with a user. We introduce a novel control architecture that integrates a gaze-like attention engine with an arousal-modulated motion system to generate socially meaningful behaviours. In a user study, we find that robots exhibiting high attention -- actively directing their focus toward users -- are perceived as warmer and more competent, intentional, and lifelike. In contrast, high arousal -- characterized by fast, expansive, and energetic motions -- increases perceptions of discomfort and disturbance. Importantly, a combination of focused attention and moderate arousal yields the highest ratings of trust and sociability, while excessive arousal diminishes social engagement. These findings offer design insights for endowing non-humanoid robots with expressive, intuitive behaviours that support more natural human-robot interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Hands-on aerial robotics courses are pivotal in training the next-generation workforce to meet the growing market demands. Such an efficient and compelling course depends on a reliable testbed. In this paper, we present VizFlyt, an open-source perception-centric Hardware-In-The-Loop (HITL) photorealistic testing framework for aerial robotics courses. We utilize pose from an external localization system to hallucinate real-time and photorealistic visual sensors using 3D Gaussian Splatting. This enables stress-free testing of autonomy algorithms on aerial robots without the risk of crashing into obstacles. We achieve over 100Hz of system update rate. Lastly, we build upon our past experiences of offering hands-on aerial robotics courses and propose a new open-source and open-hardware curriculum based on VizFlyt for the future. We test our framework on various course projects in real-world HITL experiments and present the results showing the efficacy of such a system and its large potential use cases.

| **[Value Iteration for Learning Concurrently Executable Robotic Control Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01174v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many modern robotic systems such as multi-robot systems and manipulators exhibit redundancy, a property owing to which they are capable of executing multiple tasks. This work proposes a novel method, based on the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm, to train redundant robots to be able to execute multiple tasks concurrently. Our approach differs from typical multi-objective RL methods insofar as the learned tasks can be combined and executed in possibly time-varying prioritized stacks. We do so by first defining a notion of task independence between learned value functions. We then use our definition of task independence to propose a cost functional that encourages a policy, based on an approximated value function, to accomplish its control objective while minimally interfering with the execution of higher priority tasks. This allows us to train a set of control policies that can be executed simultaneously. We also introduce a version of fitted value iteration to learn to approximate our proposed cost functional efficiently. We demonstrate our approach on several scenarios and robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in AAMAS 2025 conference: https://aamas2025.org/</p></details> |

In this paper, we firstly introduce an improved hardware design of the bipedal robot SLIDER with new line-feet and more optimized mass distribution which enables higher locomotion speeds. Secondly, we propose an extended Hybrid Zero Dynamics (eHZD) method, which can be applied to prismatic joint robots like SLIDER. The eHZD method is then used to generate a library of gaits with varying reference velocities in an offline way. Thirdly, a Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed to use the pre-generated library to create walking control policies in real-time. This approach allows us to combine the advantages of both HZD (for generating stable gaits with a full-dynamics model) and DRL (for real-time adaptive gait generation). The experimental results show that this approach achieves 150% higher walking velocity than the previous MPC-based approach.</p></details> |  |

Based on an analysis of 274 human-robot interactions and interviews with N=65 individuals or groups, we discovered that people were responding not only to the robots or their behavior, but also to the general idea of deploying robots as trashcans, and the larger social implications of that idea. They wanted to understand details about the deployment because having that knowledge would change how they interact with the robot. Based on our data and analysis, we have provided implications for design that may be topics for future human-robot design researchers who are exploring robots for public space deployment. Furthermore, our work offers a practical example of analyzing field data to make sense of robots in public spaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Procedural Framework for Low-latency Robot-Assisted Hand-Object Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19531v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in robotics have been driving the development of human-robot interaction (HRI) technologies. However, accurately perceiving human actions and achieving adaptive control remains a challenge in facilitating seamless coordination between human and robotic movements. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical procedural framework to enable dynamic robot-assisted hand-object interaction. An open-loop hierarchy leverages the computer vision (CV)-based 3D reconstruction of the human hand, based on which motion primitives have been designed to translate hand motions into robotic actions. The low-level coordination hierarchy fine-tunes the robot's action by using the continuously updated 3D hand models. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the hierarchical control architecture. The adaptive coordination between human and robot behavior has achieved a delay of $\leq 0.3$ seconds in the tele-interaction scenario. A case study of ring-wearing tasks indicates the potential application of this work in assistive technologies such as healthcare and manufacturing.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DELTA: Decomposed Efficient Long-Term Robot Task Planning using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03275v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a revolution across many research fields. In robotics, the integration of common-sense knowledge from LLMs into task and motion planning has drastically advanced the field by unlocking unprecedented levels of context awareness. Despite their vast collection of knowledge, large language models may generate infeasible plans due to hallucinations or missing domain information. To address these challenges and improve plan feasibility and computational efficiency, we introduce DELTA, a novel LLM-informed task planning approach. By using scene graphs as environment representations within LLMs, DELTA achieves rapid generation of precise planning problem descriptions. To enhance planning performance, DELTA decomposes long-term task goals with LLMs into an autoregressive sequence of sub-goals, enabling automated task planners to efficiently solve complex problems. In our extensive evaluation, we show that DELTA enables an efficient and fully automatic task planning pipeline, achieving higher planning success rates and significantly shorter planning times compared to the state of the art.

We propose to define a formal semantics to BT by translating them to a formal language which enables us to perform verification of programs written with BT, as well as runtime verification while these BT execute. This allows us to formally verify BT correctness without requiring BT programmers to master formal languages and without compromising BT most valuable features: modularity, flexibility and reusability. We present the formal framework we use: Fiacre, its language and the produced TTS model; Tina, its model checking tools and Hippo, its runtime verification engine. We then show how the translation from BT to Fiacre is automatically done, the type of formal LTL and CTL properties we can check offline and how to execute the formal model online in place of a regular BT engine. We illustrate our approach on two robotics applications, and show how BT can be extended with state variables, eval nodes, node evaluation results and benefit of other features available in the Fiacre formal framework (e.g., time).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Graph-to-Text Approach to Knowledge-Grounded Response Generation in Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16137v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs are often used to represent structured information in a flexible and efficient manner, but their use in situated dialogue remains under-explored. This paper presents a novel conversational model for human--robot interaction that rests upon a graph-based representation of the dialogue state. The knowledge graph representing the dialogue state is continuously updated with new observations from the robot sensors, including linguistic, situated and multimodal inputs, and is further enriched by other modules, in particular for spatial understanding. The neural conversational model employed to respond to user utterances relies on a simple but effective graph-to-text mechanism that traverses the dialogue state graph and converts the traversals into a natural language form. This conversion of the state graph into text is performed using a set of parameterized functions, and the values for those parameters are optimized based on a small set of Wizard-of-Oz interactions. After this conversion, the text representation of the dialogue state graph is included as part of the prompt of a large language model used to decode the agent response. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated through a user study with a humanoid robot that acts as conversation partner to evaluate the impact of the graph-to-text mechanism on the response generation. After moving a robot along a tour of an indoor environment, participants interacted with the robot using spoken dialogue and evaluated how well the robot was able to answer questions about what the robot observed during the tour. User scores show a statistically significant improvement in the perceived factuality of the robot responses when the graph-to-text approach is employed, compared to a baseline using inputs structured as semantic triples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Dialogue & Discourse 2023</p></details> |
| **[Auditory Localization and Assessment of Consequential Robot Sounds: A Multi-Method Study in Virtual Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00697v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robots increasingly operate alongside humans but are often out of sight, so that humans need to rely on the sounds of the robots to recognize their presence. For successful human-robot interaction (HRI), it is therefore crucial to understand how humans perceive robots by their consequential sounds, i.e., operating noise. Prior research suggests that the sound of a quadruped Go1 is more detectable than that of a wheeled Turtlebot. This study builds on this and examines the human ability to localize consequential sounds of three robots (quadruped Go1, wheeled Turtlebot 2i, wheeled HSR) in Virtual Reality. In a within-subjects design, we assessed participants' localization performance for the robots with and without an acoustic vehicle alerting system (AVAS) for two velocities (0.3, 0.8 m/s) and two trajectories (head-on, radial). In each trial, participants were presented with the sound of a moving robot for 3~s and were tasked to point at its final position (localization task). Localization errors were measured as the absolute angular difference between the participants' estimated and the actual robot position. Results showed that the robot type significantly influenced the localization accuracy and precision, with the sound of the wheeled HSR (especially without AVAS) performing worst under all experimental conditions. Surprisingly, participants rated the HSR sound as more positive, less annoying, and more trustworthy than the Turtlebot and Go1 sound. This reveals a tension between subjective evaluation and objective auditory localization performance. Our findings highlight consequential robot sounds as a critical factor for designing intuitive and effective HRI, with implications for human-centered robot design and social navigation.</p></details> |  |

Yet, their black box nature and abstract reasoning pose challenges for human-robot interaction (HRI), because humans may experience difficulty in understanding and predicting the robot's navigation decisions, hindering trust development. We present a virtual reality (VR) interface that visualizes explainable AI (XAI) outputs and the robot's lidar perception to support intuitive interpretation of RL-based navigation behavior. By visually highlighting objects based on their attribution scores, the interface grounds abstract policy explanations in the scene context. This XAI visualization bridges the gap between obscure numerical XAI attribution scores and a human-centric semantic level of explanation. A within-subjects study with 24 participants evaluated the effectiveness of our interface for four visualization conditions combining XAI and lidar. Participants ranked scene objects across navigation scenarios based on their importance to the robot, followed by a questionnaire assessing subjective understanding and predictability. Results show that semantic projection of attributions significantly enhances non-expert users' objective understanding and subjective awareness of robot behavior. In addition, lidar visualization further improves perceived predictability, underscoring the value of integrating XAI and sensor for transparent, trustworthy HRI.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we propose symmetric data augmentation dedicated to the proposed observation space and random network distillation to enhance bipedal locomotion learning over rough terrain. We validate our approach through hardware experiments on a miniature-sized humanoid EVAL-03 over a variety of environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method improves rapid stabilization capabilities over non-rigid surfaces and sudden environmental transitions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

This paper presents MRHaD, a Mixed Reality-based Hand-drawn Map Editing Interface that enables intuitive, real-time map modifications through natural hand gestures. By integrating the MR head-mounted display with the robotic navigation system, operators can directly create hand-drawn restricted zones (HRZ), thereby bridging the gap between 2D map representations and the real-world environment. Comparative experiments against conventional 2D editing methods demonstrate that MRHaD significantly improves editing efficiency, map accuracy, and overall usability, contributing to safer and more efficient mobile robot operations. The proposed approach provides a robust technical foundation for advancing human-robot collaboration and establishing innovative interaction models that enhance the hybrid future of robotics and human society.

Despite the success of experience replay and parameter-efficient methods in alleviating catastrophic forgetting problem, naively applying these methods causes a failure to leverage the shared primitives between skills. To tackle these issues, we propose Primitive Prompt Learning (PPL), to achieve lifelong robot manipulation via reusable and extensible primitives. Within our two stage learning scheme, we first learn a set of primitive prompts to represent shared primitives through multi-skills pre-training stage, where motion-aware prompts are learned to capture semantic and motion shared primitives across different skills. Secondly, when acquiring new skills in lifelong span, new prompts are appended and optimized with frozen pretrained prompts, boosting the learning via knowledge transfer from old skills to new ones. For evaluation, we construct a large-scale skill dataset and conduct extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks, demonstrating PPL's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, the scarcity of such data presents a significant hurdle to extending these methods to general use cases. To address this concern, we present an automated framework to decompose trajectory data into temporally bounded and natural language-based descriptive sub-tasks by leveraging recent prompting strategies for Foundation Models (FMs) including both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework provides both time-based and language-based descriptions for lower-level sub-tasks that comprise full trajectories. To rigorously evaluate the quality of our automatic labeling framework, we contribute an algorithm SIMILARITY to produce two novel metrics, temporal similarity and semantic similarity. The metrics measure the temporal alignment and semantic fidelity of language descriptions between two sub-task decompositions, namely an FM sub-task decomposition prediction and a ground-truth sub-task decomposition. We present scores for temporal similarity and semantic similarity above 90%, compared to 30% of a randomized baseline, for multiple robotic environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

| **[Scalable Real2Sim: Physics-Aware Asset Generation Via Robotic Pick-and-Place Setups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00370v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating object dynamics from real-world perception shows great promise for digital twins and robotic manipulation but often demands labor-intensive measurements and expertise. We present a fully automated Real2Sim pipeline that generates simulation-ready assets for real-world objects through robotic interaction. Using only a robot's joint torque sensors and an external camera, the pipeline identifies visual geometry, collision geometry, and physical properties such as inertial parameters. Our approach introduces a general method for extracting high-quality, object-centric meshes from photometric reconstruction techniques (e.g., NeRF, Gaussian Splatting) by employing alpha-transparent training while explicitly distinguishing foreground occlusions from background subtraction. We validate the full pipeline through extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse objects. By eliminating the need for manual intervention or environment modifications, our pipeline can be integrated directly into existing pick-and-place setups, enabling scalable and efficient dataset creation.

| **[PneuDrive: An Embedded Pressure Control System and Modeling Toolkit for Large-Scale Soft Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00222v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a modular pressure control system called PneuDrive that can be used for large-scale, pneumatically-actuated soft robots. The design is particularly suited for situations which require distributed pressure control and high flow rates. Up to four embedded pressure control modules can be daisy-chained together as peripherals on a robust RS-485 bus, enabling closed-loop control of up to 16 valves with pressures ranging from 0-100 psig (0-689 kPa) over distances of more than 10 meters. The system is configured as a C++ ROS node by default. However, independent of ROS, we provide a Python interface with a scripting API for added flexibility. We demonstrate our implementation of PneuDrive through various trajectory tracking experiments for a three-joint, continuum soft robot with 12 different pressure inputs. Finally, we present a modeling toolkit with implementations of three dynamic actuation models, all suitable for real-time simulation and control. We demonstrate the use of this toolkit in customizing each model with real-world data and evaluating the performance of each model. The results serve as a reference guide for choosing between several actuation models in a principled manner.

| **[Enhancing Physical Human-Robot Interaction: Recognizing Digits via Intrinsic Robot Tactile Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00167v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) remains a key challenge for achieving intuitive and safe interaction with robots. Current advancements often rely on external tactile sensors as interface, which increase the complexity of robotic systems. In this study, we leverage the intrinsic tactile sensing capabilities of collaborative robots to recognize digits drawn by humans on an uninstrumented touchpad mounted to the robot's flange. We propose a dataset of robot joint torque signals along with corresponding end-effector (EEF) forces and moments, captured from the robot's integrated torque sensors in each joint, as users draw handwritten digits (0-9) on the touchpad. The pHRI-DIGI-TACT dataset was collected from different users to capture natural variations in handwriting. To enhance classification robustness, we developed a data augmentation technique to account for reversed and rotated digits inputs. A Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network, leveraging the spatiotemporal nature of the data, performs online digit classification with an overall accuracy of 94\% across various test scenarios, including those involving users who did not participate in training the system. This methodology is implemented on a real robot in a fruit delivery task, demonstrating its potential to assist individuals in everyday life.
