| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation and Understanding in Vision: A Survey and New Outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18016v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal technique in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling access to external, reliable, and up-to-date knowledge sources. In the context of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), RAG has proven invaluable by augmenting model outputs with supplementary, relevant information, thus improving their quality. Recently, the potential of RAG has extended beyond natural language processing, with emerging methods integrating retrieval-augmented strategies into the computer vision (CV) domain. These approaches aim to address the limitations of relying solely on internal model knowledge by incorporating authoritative external knowledge bases, thereby improving both the understanding and generation capabilities of vision models. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV, focusing on two main areas: (I) visual understanding and (II) visual generation. In the realm of visual understanding, we systematically review tasks ranging from basic image recognition to complex applications such as medical report generation and multimodal question answering. For visual content generation, we examine the application of RAG in tasks related to image, video, and 3D generation. Furthermore, we explore recent advancements in RAG for embodied AI, with a particular focus on applications in planning, task execution, multimodal perception, interaction, and specialized domains. Given that the integration of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV is still in its early stages, we also highlight the key limitations of current approaches and propose future research directions to drive the development of this promising area.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[NavCoT: Boosting LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation via Learning Disentangled Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07376v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/NavCoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and tailored 3D scene understanding designs. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZeroHSI: Zero-Shot 4D Human-Scene Interaction by Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18600v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-scene interaction (HSI) generation is crucial for applications in embodied AI, virtual reality, and robotics. Yet, existing methods cannot synthesize interactions in unseen environments such as in-the-wild scenes or reconstructed scenes, as they rely on paired 3D scenes and captured human motion data for training, which are unavailable for unseen environments. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis, eliminating the need for training on any MoCap data. Our key insight is to distill human-scene interactions from state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/ The first two authors contribute equally</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Training of Generalizable Visuomotor Policies via Control-Aware Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09258v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving generalization is one key challenge in embodied AI, where obtaining large-scale datasets across diverse scenarios is costly. Traditional weak augmentations, such as cropping and flipping, are insufficient for improving a model's performance in new environments. Existing data augmentation methods often disrupt task-relevant information in images, potentially degrading performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EAGLE, an efficient training framework for generalizable visuomotor policies that improves upon existing methods by (1) enhancing generalization by applying augmentation only to control-related regions identified through a self-supervised control-aware mask and (2) improving training stability and efficiency by distilling knowledge from an expert to a visuomotor student policy, which is then deployed to unseen environments without further fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on three domains, including the DMControl Generalization Benchmark, the enhanced Robot Manipulation Distraction Benchmark, and a long-sequential drawer-opening task, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[KARMA: Augmenting Embodied AI Agents with Long-and-short Term Memory Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14908v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI agents responsible for executing interconnected, long-sequence household tasks often face difficulties with in-context memory, leading to inefficiencies and errors in task execution. To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KARMA's plug-and-play capability allows for seamless deployment on real-world robotic systems, such as mobile manipulation platforms.Through this plug-and-play memory system, KARMA significantly enhances the ability of embodied agents to generate coherent and contextually appropriate plans, making the execution of complex household tasks more efficient. The experimental videos from the work can be found at https://youtu.be/4BT7fnw9ehs. Our code is available at https://github.com/WZX0Swarm0Robotics/KARMA/tree/master.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D-GRAND: A Million-Scale Dataset for 3D-LLMs with Better Grounding and Less Hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05132v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of language and 3D perception is crucial for embodied agents and robots that comprehend and interact with the physical world. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities, their adaptation to 3D environments (3D-LLMs) remains in its early stages. A primary challenge is a lack of large-scale datasets with dense grounding between language and 3D scenes. We introduce 3D-GRAND, a pioneering large-scale dataset comprising 40,087 household scenes paired with 6.2 million densely-grounded scene-language instructions. Our results show that instruction tuning with 3D-GRAND significantly enhances grounding capabilities and reduces hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. As part of our contributions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark 3D-POPE to systematically evaluate hallucination in 3D-LLMs, enabling fair comparisons of models. Our experiments highlight a scaling effect between dataset size and 3D-LLM performance, emphasizing the importance of large-scale 3D-text datasets for embodied AI research. Our results demonstrate early signals for effective sim-to-real transfer, indicating that models trained on large synthetic data can perform well on real-world 3D scans. Through 3D-GRAND and 3D-POPE, we aim to equip the embodied AI community with resources and insights to lead to more reliable and better-grounded 3D-LLMs. Project website: https://3d-grand.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Towards Agentic AI Networking in 6G: A Generative Foundation Model-as-Agent Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15764v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The promising potential of AI and network convergence in improving networking performance and enabling new service capabilities has recently attracted significant interest. Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under revision at IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |
| **[Latent Action Learning Requires Supervision in the Presence of Distractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00379v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[SpatialBot: Precise Spatial Understanding with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13642v7)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in 2D image understanding, however they are still struggling with spatial understanding which is the foundation of Embodied AI. In this paper, we propose SpatialBot for better spatial understanding by feeding both RGB and depth images. Additionally, we have constructed the SpatialQA dataset, which involves multi-level depth-related questions to train VLMs for depth understanding. Finally, we present SpatialBench to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' capabilities in spatial understanding at different levels. Extensive experiments on our spatial-understanding benchmark, general VLM benchmarks and Embodied AI tasks, demonstrate the remarkable improvements of SpatialBot trained on SpatialQA. The model, code and data are available at https://github.com/BAAI-DCAI/SpatialBot.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoK-RAG: Mixture of Knowledge Paths Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Embodied AI Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13882v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While human cognition inherently retrieves information from diverse and specialized knowledge sources during decision-making processes, current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically operate through single-source knowledge retrieval, leading to a cognitive-algorithmic discrepancy. To bridge this gap, we introduce MoK-RAG, a novel multi-source RAG framework that implements a mixture of knowledge paths enhanced retrieval mechanism through functional partitioning of a large language model (LLM) corpus into distinct sections, enabling retrieval from multiple specialized knowledge paths. Applied to the generation of 3D simulated environments, our proposed MoK-RAG3D enhances this paradigm by partitioning 3D assets into distinct sections and organizing them based on a hierarchical knowledge tree structure. Different from previous methods that only use manual evaluation, we pioneered the introduction of automated evaluation methods for 3D scenes. Both automatic and human evaluations in our experiments demonstrate that MoK-RAG3D can assist Embodied AI agents in generating diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Infinite Mobility: Scalable High-Fidelity Synthesis of Articulated Objects via Procedural Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13424v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale articulated objects with high quality are desperately needed for multiple tasks related to embodied AI. Most existing methods for creating articulated objects are either data-driven or simulation based, which are limited by the scale and quality of the training data or the fidelity and heavy labour of the simulation. In this paper, we propose Infinite Mobility, a novel method for synthesizing high-fidelity articulated objects through procedural generation. User study and quantitative evaluation demonstrate that our method can produce results that excel current state-of-the-art methods and are comparable to human-annotated datasets in both physics property and mesh quality. Furthermore, we show that our synthetic data can be used as training data for generative models, enabling next-step scaling up.

| **[Exploring 3D Activity Reasoning and Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D activity reasoning and planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advance in multimodal learning. However, most existing works share two constraints: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. To bridge the gaps, we propose 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans, and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[HIS-GPT: Towards 3D Human-In-Scene Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12955v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new task to benchmark human-in-scene understanding for embodied agents: Human-In-Scene Question Answering (HIS-QA). Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning in visual navigation of end-to-end trained agents: a dynamical systems approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08306v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Progress in Embodied AI has made it possible for end-to-end-trained agents to navigate in photo-realistic environments with high-level reasoning and zero-shot or language-conditioned behavior, but benchmarks are still dominated by simulation. In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control. An interactive tool is available at europe.naverlabs.com/research/publications/reasoning-in-visual-navigation-of-end-to-end-trained-agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[S2O: Static to Openable Enhancement for Articulated 3D Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18896v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite much progress in large 3D datasets there are currently few interactive 3D object datasets, and their scale is limited due to the manual effort required in their construction. We introduce the static to openable (S2O) task which creates interactive articulated 3D objects from static counterparts through openable part detection, motion prediction, and interior geometry completion. We formulate a unified framework to tackle this task, and curate a challenging dataset of openable 3D objects that serves as a test bed for systematic evaluation. Our experiments benchmark methods from prior work, extended and improved methods, and simple yet effective heuristics for the S2O task. We find that turning static 3D objects into interactively openable counterparts is possible but that all methods struggle to generalize to realistic settings of the task, and we highlight promising future work directions. Our work enables efficient creation of interactive 3D objects for robotic manipulation and embodied AI tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoMa-Kitchen: A 100K+ Benchmark for Affordance-Grounded Last-Mile Navigation in Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11081v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mobile manipulation, navigation and manipulation are often treated as separate problems, resulting in a significant gap between merely approaching an object and engaging with it effectively. Many navigation approaches primarily define success by proximity to the target, often overlooking the necessity for optimal positioning that facilitates subsequent manipulation. To address this, we introduce MoMa-Kitchen, a benchmark dataset comprising over 100k samples that provide training data for models to learn optimal final navigation positions for seamless transition to manipulation. Our dataset includes affordance-grounded floor labels collected from diverse kitchen environments, in which robotic mobile manipulators of different models attempt to grasp target objects amidst clutter. Using a fully automated pipeline, we simulate diverse real-world scenarios and generate affordance labels for optimal manipulation positions. Visual data are collected from RGB-D inputs captured by a first-person view camera mounted on the robotic arm, ensuring consistency in viewpoint during data collection. We also develop a lightweight baseline model, NavAff, for navigation affordance grounding that demonstrates promising performance on the MoMa-Kitchen benchmark. Our approach enables models to learn affordance-based final positioning that accommodates different arm types and platform heights, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable integration of navigation and manipulation in embodied AI.

| **[Making Every Frame Matter: Continuous Activity Recognition in Streaming Video via Adaptive Video Context Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14993v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video activity recognition has become increasingly important in robots and embodied AI. Recognizing continuous video activities poses considerable challenges due to the fast expansion of streaming video, which contains multi-scale and untrimmed activities. We introduce a novel system, CARS, to overcome these issues through adaptive video context modeling. Adaptive video context modeling refers to selectively maintaining activity-related features in temporal and spatial dimensions. CARS has two key designs. The first is an activity spatial feature extraction by eliminating irrelevant visual features while maintaining recognition accuracy. The second is an activity-aware state update introducing dynamic adaptability to better preserve the video context for multi-scale activity recognition. Our CARS runs at speeds $>$30 FPS on typical edge devices and outperforms all baselines by 1.2\% to 79.7\% in accuracy. Moreover, we explore applying CARS to a large video model as a video encoder. Experimental results show that our CARS can result in a 0.46-point enhancement (on a 5-point scale) on the in-distribution video activity dataset, and an improvement ranging from 1.19\% to 4\% on zero-shot video activity datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Long-horizon Embodied Planning with Implicit Logical Inference and Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15658v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon embodied planning underpins embodied AI. To accomplish long-horizon tasks, one of the most feasible ways is to decompose abstract instructions into a sequence of actionable steps. Foundation models still face logical errors and hallucinations in long-horizon planning, unless provided with highly relevant examples to the tasks. However, providing highly relevant examples for any random task is unpractical. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a novel framework for Real-time Long-horizon Embodied Planning. ReLEP can complete a wide range of long-horizon tasks without in-context examples by learning implicit logical inference through fine-tuning. The fine-tuned large vision-language model formulates plans as sequences of skill functions. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. When constructing the dataset, we considered the implicit logical relationships, enabling the model to learn implicit logical relationships and dispel hallucinations. Through comprehensive evaluations across various long-horizon tasks, ReLEP demonstrates high success rates and compliance to execution even on unseen tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[AhaRobot: A Low-Cost Open-Source Bimanual Mobile Manipulator for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10070v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation and manipulation in open-world environments remain unsolved challenges in the Embodied AI. The high cost of commercial mobile manipulation robots significantly limits research in real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose AhaRobot, a low-cost and fully open-source dual-arm mobile manipulation robot system with a hardware cost of only $1,000 (excluding optional computational resources), which is less than 1/15 of the cost of popular mobile robots. The AhaRobot system consists of three components: (1) a novel low-cost hardware architecture primarily composed of off-the-shelf components, (2) an optimized control solution to enhance operational precision integrating dual-motor backlash control and static friction compensation, and (3) a simple remote teleoperation method RoboPilot. We use handles to control the dual arms and pedals for whole-body movement. The teleoperation process is low-burden and easy to operate, much like piloting. RoboPilot is designed for remote data collection in embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboPilot significantly enhances data collection efficiency in complex manipulation tasks, achieving a 30% increase compared to methods using 3D mouse and leader-follower systems. It also excels at completing extremely long-horizon tasks in one go. Furthermore, AhaRobot can be used to learn end-to-end policies and autonomously perform complex manipulation tasks, such as pen insertion and cleaning up the floor. We aim to build an affordable yet powerful platform to promote the development of embodied tasks on real devices, advancing more robust and reliable embodied AI.

Current screen based chat-bots do not take advantage of the the full-suite of natural inputs available in XR, including inward facing sensor data, instead they over-rely on explicit voice or text prompts, sometimes paired with multi-modal data dropped as part of the query. We propose a solution that leverages an attention framework that derives context implicitly from user actions, eye-gaze, and contextual memory within the XR environment. Our work minimizes the need for engineered explicit prompts, fostering grounded and intuitive interactions that glean user insights for the chat-bot.</p></details> |  |
| **[HO-Cap: A Capture System and Dataset for 3D Reconstruction and Pose Tracking of Hand-Object Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06843v4)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a data capture system and a new dataset, HO-Cap, for 3D reconstruction and pose tracking of hands and objects in videos. The system leverages multiple RGBD cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Effectiveness of a Socratic Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning Method for Task Planning in Robotics, A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08174v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in reasoning with natural language. Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks. To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenFly: A Versatile Toolchain and Large-scale Benchmark for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents through an environment by leveraging both language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Interactive systems assist humans in these tasks, enabling applications in Embodied AI, human-robot interaction, and virtual reality. However, current methods in hand-object synthesis often neglect dynamics and focus on generating static grasps. The first part of this dissertation introduces dynamic grasp synthesis, where a hand grasps and moves an object to a target pose. We approach this task using physical simulation and reinforcement learning. We then extend this to bimanual manipulation and articulated objects, requiring fine-grained coordination between hands. In the second part of this dissertation, we study human-to-robot handovers. We integrate captured human motion into simulation and introduce a student-teacher framework that adapts to human behavior and transfers from sim to real. To overcome data scarcity, we generate synthetic interactions, increasing training diversity by 100x. Our user study finds no difference between policies trained on synthetic vs. real motions.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |

However, real-world datasets often lack sufficient data for training and evaluation, and synthetic datasets, while larger, lack acoustic realism. Consequently, neither effectively meets practical needs. To address this issue, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit based on the embodied AI simulation platform Habitat-sim, designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim supports multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level adjustments, enabling the creation of more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a benchmark dataset called SonicSet, utilizing LibriSpeech, Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K), Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to investigate the differences between synthetic and real-world data, we selected 5 hours of raw, non-reverberant data from the SonicSet validation set and recorded a real-world speech separation dataset, providing a reference for comparing SonicSet with other synthetic datasets. For speech enhancement, we utilized the real-world dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between SonicSet and existing synthetic datasets. The results indicate that models trained on SonicSet generalize better to real-world scenarios compared to other synthetic datasets. The code is publicly available at https://cslikai.cn/SonicSim/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |
| **[WMNav: Integrating Vision-Language Models into World Models for Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02247v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Goal Navigation-requiring an agent to locate a specific object in an unseen environment-remains a core challenge in embodied AI. Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 11 figures, manuscript accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |
| **[AffordGrasp: In-Context Affordance Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary Task-Oriented Grasping in Clutter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00778v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring the affordance of an object and grasping it in a task-oriented manner is crucial for robots to successfully complete manipulation tasks. Affordance indicates where and how to grasp an object by taking its functionality into account, serving as the foundation for effective task-oriented grasping. However, current task-oriented methods often depend on extensive training data that is confined to specific tasks and objects, making it difficult to generalize to novel objects and complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce AffordGrasp, a novel open-vocabulary grasping framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) for in-context affordance reasoning. Unlike existing methods that rely on explicit task and object specifications, our approach infers tasks directly from implicit user instructions, enabling more intuitive and seamless human-robot interaction in everyday scenarios. Building on the reasoning outcomes, our framework identifies task-relevant objects and grounds their part-level affordances using a visual grounding module. This allows us to generate task-oriented grasp poses precisely within the affordance regions of the object, ensuring both functional and context-aware robotic manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. We believe our approach advances robotic manipulation techniques and contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://eqcy.github.io/affordgrasp/.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of prior magical grasp implementations at a fraction of the GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |

These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Pattern Recognition Letters.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, when powered by open LLMs, they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a multicomponent memory system. In Minecraft experiments, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks where traditional Voyager fails without GPT-4, collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items and achieving $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones, advancing from basic wood tools to advanced iron equipment. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated collaborative experiences. MindForge advances the democratization of embodied AI development through open-ended social learning, enabling peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.</p></details> |  |

Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |

We propose a taxonomy that categorizes EMAS by system architectures and embodiment modalities, emphasizing how collaboration spans both physical and virtual contexts. Central building blocks, perception, planning, communication, and feedback, are then analyzed to illustrate how generative techniques bolster system robustness and flexibility. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the transformative effects of integrating foundation models into embodied, multi-agent frameworks. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions, underlining the significant promise of EMAS to reshape the landscape of AI-driven collaboration.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We propose a novel object-centric latent action learning approach, based on VideoSaur and LAPO, that employs self-supervised decomposition of scenes into object representations and annotates video data with proxy-action labels. This method effectively disentangles causal agent-object interactions from irrelevant background noise and reduces the performance degradation of latent action learning approaches caused by distractors. Our preliminary experiments with the Distracting Control Suite show that latent action pretraining based on object decompositions improve the quality of inferred latent actions by x2.7 and efficiency of downstream fine-tuning with a small set of labeled actions, increasing return by x2.6 on average.</p></details> | Preprint.

However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

These advancements have led to an explosive increase in the demand for computational power, challenging the limits of Moore's Law. Optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing, faces significant challenges due to its high costs. To address this, various lithography simulators have been developed. However, many of these simulators are limited by their inadequate photoresist modeling capabilities. This paper presents TorchResist, an open-source, differentiable photoresist simulator.TorchResist employs an analytical approach to model the photoresist process, functioning as a white-box system with at most twenty interpretable parameters. Leveraging modern differentiable programming techniques and parallel computing on GPUs, TorchResist enables seamless co-optimization with other tools across multiple related tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that TorchResist achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing solutions.

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |

Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code will be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |

This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions. This highlights the critical need for robust goal specification and safety frameworks before any physical implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected Version - Solved Some Issues with reference compilation by latex</p></details> |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

Nevertheless, the rapid development of MEANETs is accompanied by challenges in trustworthiness and operational efficiency. Fortunately, blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable characteristics, offers promising solutions for MEANETs. However, existing block propagation mechanisms suffer from challenges such as low propagation efficiency and weak security for block propagation, which results in delayed transmission of vehicular messages or vulnerability to malicious tampering, potentially causing severe traffic accidents in blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Moreover, current block propagation strategies cannot effectively adapt to real-time changes of dynamic topology in MEANETs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph Resfusion model-based trustworthy block propagation optimization framework for consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Specifically, we propose an innovative trust calculation mechanism based on the trust cloud model, which comprehensively accounts for randomness and fuzziness in the miner trust evaluation. Furthermore, by leveraging the strengths of graph neural networks and diffusion models, we develop a graph Resfusion model to effectively and adaptively generate the optimal block propagation trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other routing mechanisms in terms of block propagation efficiency and trustworthiness. Additionally, the results highlight its strong adaptability to dynamic environments, making it particularly suitable for rapidly changing MEANETs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</p></details> | Website: GenEx.world |

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks. This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context. Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |

The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans.

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV. Finally, we discuss several future research directions for advancing EAI-enabled LAE.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</p></details> |  |

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |
| **[ON as ALC: Active Loop Closing Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11523v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In simultaneous localization and mapping, active loop closing (ALC) is an active vision problem that aims to visually guide a robot to maximize the chances of revisiting previously visited points, thereby resetting the drift errors accumulated in the incrementally built map during travel. However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |

The central case study is Jess+ an intelligent digital score system for shared creativity with a mixed ensemble of non-disabled and disabled musicians. The overarching aim is that the digital score enables disabled musicians to thrive in a live music conversation with other musicians regardless of the potential barriers of disability and music-making. After defining what we mean by embodied AI and how this approach supports the aims of the Jess+ project, we outline the main design features of the system. This includes several novel approaches such as its modular design, an AI Factory based on an embodied musicking dataset, and an embedded belief system. Our findings showed that the implemented design decisions and embodied-AI approach led to rich experiences for the musicians which in turn transformed their practice as an inclusive ensemble.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models in Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07904v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated a wide range of capabilities across many domains, including Embodied AI. In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This study finds that state-of-the-art embodied AI agents compete for higher navigation quality, but often compromise the computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce "Skip-SCAR," an optimization framework that builds computationally and memory-efficient embodied AI agents to accomplish high-quality visual navigation tasks. Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint. Tested on the HM3D ObjectNav datasets and real-world physical hardware systems, Skip-SCAR not only minimizes hardware resources but also sets new performance benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of optimizing both navigation quality and computational efficiency for robotics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Privacy Risks in Reinforcement Learning for Household Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09273v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prominence of embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI), which empowers robots to navigate, perceive, and engage within virtual environments, has attracted significant attention, owing to the remarkable advances in computer vision and large language models. Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

Despite recent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods often lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in scenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this paper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and scalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors and multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion (OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved surfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric fidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital twins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM-based planners are inefficient due to their large number of parameters and prone to inaccuracies because they operate in open-loop systems. We think the reason is that only applying LLMs as planners is insufficient. In this work, we propose DaDu-E, a robust closed-loop planning framework for embodied AI robots. Specifically, DaDu-E is equipped with a relatively lightweight LLM, a set of encapsulated robot skill instructions, a robust feedback system, and memory augmentation. Together, these components enable DaDu-E to (i) actively perceive and adapt to dynamic environments, (ii) optimize computational costs while maintaining high performance, and (iii) recover from execution failures using its memory and feedback mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world and simulated tasks show that DaDu-E achieves task success rates comparable to embodied AI robots with larger models as planners like COME-Robot, while reducing computational requirements by $6.6 \times$.

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters, connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and easy integration with downstream tasks.

| **[Learning Reward and Policy Jointly from Demonstration and Preference Improves Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06874v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for building contemporary foundation models and embodied AI. However, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning task. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant under-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward model and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment performance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated Human Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and demonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach admits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and leverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy Optimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment pipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with extensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially when the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[EARBench: Towards Evaluating Physical Risk Awareness for Task Planning of Foundation Model-based Embodied AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04449v5)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) integrates advanced AI models into physical entities for real-world interaction. The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EARBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EARDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

| **[AVID: Adapting Video Diffusion Models to World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12822v2)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale generative models have achieved remarkable success in a number of domains. However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downstream tasks. Image-to-video diffusion models are already capable of generating highly realistic synthetic videos. However, these models are not action-conditioned, and the most powerful models are closed-source which means they cannot be finetuned. In this work, we propose to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to action-conditioned world models, without access to the parameters of the pretrained model. Our approach, AVID, trains an adapter on a small domain-specific dataset of action-labelled videos. AVID uses a learned mask to modify the intermediate outputs of the pretrained model and generate accurate action-conditioned videos. We evaluate AVID on video game and real-world robotics data, and show that it outperforms existing baselines for diffusion model adaptation.1 Our results demonstrate that if utilized correctly, pretrained video models have the potential to be powerful tools for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/avid-world-model-adapters/home</p></details> |

This is followed by employing vision foundation models to acquire additional meta-information about the scene, such as bounding boxes. Building on this foundational data, we propose a specialized VLM, SceneVLM, which is capable of generating spatial hierarchical scene graphs and providing distance information for objects within indoor environments. This information enhances our understanding of the spatial arrangement of indoor scenes. To train our SceneVLM, we collect over 610,000 images from various public indoor datasets and implement a scene data generation pipeline with a semi-automated technique to establish relationships and estimate distances among indoor objects. By utilizing this enriched data, we conduct various training recipes and finish SceneVLM. Our experiments demonstrate that \rootname facilitates indoor scene understanding and proves effective in diverse downstream applications, such as 3D scene generation and embodied AI. The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/harrytea/ROOT}.</p></details> |  |

A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

| **[Software-Hardware Co-Design For Embodied AI Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04292v4)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI robots have the potential to fundamentally improve the way human beings live and manufacture. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame-basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes Corki, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI robot control. Our idea is to decouple LLM inference, robotic control and data communication in the embodied AI robots compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, Corki predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. Corki largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to 8.0x, resulting in up to 3.6x speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 17.3%. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/hyy0613/Corki</p></details> |  |

Generated models frequently fail to maintain balance when placed in physics-based simulations or 3D printed. This balance is crucial for satisfying user design intentions in interactive gaming, embodied AI, and robotics, where stable models are needed for reliable interaction. Additionally, stable models ensure that 3D-printed objects, such as figurines for home decoration, can stand on their own without requiring additional supports. To fill this gap, we introduce Atlas3D, an automatic and easy-to-implement method that enhances existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D tools. Atlas3D ensures the generation of self-supporting 3D models that adhere to physical laws of stability under gravity, contact, and friction. Our approach combines a novel differentiable simulation-based loss function with physically inspired regularization, serving as either a refinement or a post-processing module for existing frameworks. We verify Atlas3D's efficacy through extensive generation tasks and validate the resulting 3D models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunuoch.github.io/Atlas3D/</p></details> |
| **[Architect: Generating Vivid and Interactive 3D Scenes with Hierarchical 2D Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09823v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating large-scale interactive 3D environments is essential for the development of Robotics and Embodied AI research. Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing Architect, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene. This iterative structure brings the flexibility for our method to generate or refine scenes from various starting points, such as text, floor plans, or pre-arranged environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Models in Vision: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05902v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive modeling has been a huge success in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, \textit{i.e.}, pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the strategy of representation. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multi-faceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multi-modal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: \url{https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey}.</p></details> |  |
| **["Where am I?" Scene Retrieval with Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14565v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interfaces to embodied AI are becoming more ubiquitous in our daily lives. This opens up further opportunities for language-based interaction with embodied agents, such as a user verbally instructing an agent to execute some task in a specific location. For example, "put the bowls back in the cupboard next to the fridge" or "meet me at the intersection under the red sign." As such, we need methods that interface between natural language and map representations of the environment. To this end, we explore the question of whether we can use an open-set natural language query to identify a scene represented by a 3D scene graph. We define this task as "language-based scene-retrieval" and it is closely related to "coarse-localization," but we are instead searching for a match from a collection of disjoint scenes and not necessarily a large-scale continuous map. We present Text2SceneGraphMatcher, a "scene-retrieval" pipeline that learns joint embeddings between text descriptions and scene graphs to determine if they are a match. The code, trained models, and datasets will be made public.</p></details> |  |

However, existing on-policy algorithms used for post-training are inherently incompatible with the use of experience replay buffers, which can be populated scalably by distributed off-policy actors to enhance exploration as compute increases. We propose efficiently obtaining this benefit of replay buffers via Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony (TBA), a massively scalable LLM RL system. In contrast to existing approaches, TBA uses a larger fraction of compute on search, constantly generating off-policy data for a central replay buffer. A training node simultaneously samples data from this buffer based on reward or recency to update the policy using Trajectory Balance (TB), a diversity-seeking RL objective introduced for GFlowNets. TBA offers three key advantages: (1) decoupled training and search, speeding up training wall-clock time by 4x or more; (2) improved diversity through large-scale off-policy sampling; and (3) scalable search for sparse reward settings. On mathematical reasoning, preference-tuning, and automated red-teaming (diverse and representative post-training tasks), TBA produces speed and performance improvements over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimpleRL-Zoo: Investigating and Taming Zero Reinforcement Learning for Open Base Models in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18892v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DeepSeek-R1 has shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can naturally emerge through a simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework with rule-based rewards, where the training may directly start from the base models-a paradigm referred to as zero RL training. Most recent efforts to reproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series, which may not be representative as we find the base models already exhibit strong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities. In this work, we investigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. Leveraging several key design strategies-such as adjusting format reward and controlling query difficulty-we achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings. However, by carefully monitoring the training dynamics, we observe that different base models exhibit distinct patterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not always correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as verification (i.e., the "aha moment"). Notably, we observe the "aha moment" for the first time in small models not from the Qwen family. We share the key designs that enable successful zero RL training, along with our findings and practices. To facilitate further research, we open-source the code, models, and analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimistic Q-learning for average reward and episodic reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13743v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an optimistic Q-learning algorithm for regret minimization in average reward reinforcement learning under an additional assumption on the underlying MDP that for all policies, the time to visit some frequent state $s_0$ is finite and upper bounded by $H$, either in expectation or with constant probability. Our setting strictly generalizes the episodic setting and is significantly less restrictive than the assumption of bounded hitting time \textit{for all states} made by most previous literature on model-free algorithms in average reward settings. We demonstrate a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(H^5 S\sqrt{AT})$, where $S$ and $A$ are the numbers of states and actions, and $T$ is the horizon. A key technical novelty of our work is the introduction of an $\overline{L}$ operator defined as $\overline{L} v = \frac{1}{H} \sum_{h=1}^H L^h v$ where $L$ denotes the Bellman operator. Under the given assumption, we show that the $\overline{L}$ operator has a strict contraction (in span) even in the average-reward setting where the discount factor is $1$. Our algorithm design uses ideas from episodic Q-learning to estimate and apply this operator iteratively. Thus, we provide a unified view of regret minimization in episodic and non-episodic settings, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, simplified proofs</p></details> |

Existing state-of-the-art algorithms, such as FACMAC, rely on global reward information, which may not accurately reflect the quality of individual robots' actions in decentralized systems. We integrate the concept of locality into critic learning, where strongly related robots form partitions during training. Robots within the same partition have a greater impact on each other, leading to more precise policy evaluation. Additionally, we construct a dependency graph to capture the relationships between robots, facilitating the partitioning process. This approach mitigates the curse of dimensionality and prevents robots from using irrelevant information. Our method improves existing algorithms by focusing on local rewards and leveraging partition-based learning to enhance training efficiency and performance. We evaluate the performance of Loc-FACMAC in three environments: Hallway, Multi-cartpole, and Bounded-Cooperative-Navigation. We explore the impact of partition sizes on the performance and compare the result with baseline MARL algorithms such as LOMAQ, FACMAC, and QMIX. The experiments reveal that, if the locality structure is defined properly, Loc-FACMAC outperforms these baseline algorithms up to 108\%, indicating that exploiting the locality structure in the actor-critic framework improves the MARL performance.</p></details> |  |

However, the sample efficiency of RL is crucial, and to improve it, we combine a model-based RL algorithm with our published method that turns Koopman (e)NMPCs into automatically differentiable policies. We apply our approach to an eNMPC case study of a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) model from the literature. The approach outperforms benchmark methods, i.e., data-driven eNMPCs using models based on system identification without further RL tuning of the resulting policy, and neural network controllers trained with model-based RL, by achieving superior control performance and higher sample efficiency. Furthermore, utilizing partial prior knowledge about the system dynamics via physics-informed learning further increases sample efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Simulation-Driven Balancing of Competitive Game Levels with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18748v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The balancing process for game levels in competitive two-player contexts involves a lot of manual work and testing, particularly for non-symmetrical game levels. In this work, we frame game balancing as a procedural content generation task and propose an architecture for automatically balancing of tile-based levels within the PCGRL framework (procedural content generation via reinforcement learning). Our architecture is divided into three parts: (1) a level generator, (2) a balancing agent, and (3) a reward modeling simulation. Through repeated simulations, the balancing agent receives rewards for adjusting the level towards a given balancing objective, such as equal win rates for all players. To this end, we propose new swap-based representations to improve the robustness of playability, thereby enabling agents to balance game levels more effectively and quickly compared to traditional PCGRL. By analyzing the agent's swapping behavior, we can infer which tile types have the most impact on the balance. We validate our approach in the Neural MMO (NMMO) environment in a competitive two-player scenario. In this extended conference paper, we present improved results, explore the applicability of the method to various forms of balancing beyond equal balancing, compare the performance to another search-based approach, and discuss the application of existing fairness metrics to game balancing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the journal (IEEE Transactions on Games) paper of the same name</p></details> |
| **[Physics-Informed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Multi-Robot Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00212v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The networked nature of multi-robot systems presents challenges in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Centralized control policies do not scale with increasing numbers of robots, whereas independent control policies do not exploit the information provided by other robots, exhibiting poor performance in cooperative-competitive tasks. In this work we propose a physics-informed reinforcement learning approach able to learn distributed multi-robot control policies that are both scalable and make use of all the available information to each robot. Our approach has three key characteristics. First, it imposes a port-Hamiltonian structure on the policy representation, respecting energy conservation properties of physical robot systems and the networked nature of robot team interactions. Second, it uses self-attention to ensure a sparse policy representation able to handle time-varying information at each robot from the interaction graph. Third, we present a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm parameterized by our self-attention port-Hamiltonian control policy, which accounts for the correlation among robots during training while overcoming the need of value function factorization. Extensive simulations in different multi-robot scenarios demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, surpassing previous multi-robot reinforcement learning solutions in scalability, while achieving similar or superior performance (with averaged cumulative reward up to x2 greater than the state-of-the-art with robot teams x6 larger than the number of robots at training time). We also validate our approach on multiple real robots in the Georgia Tech Robotarium under imperfect communication, demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and scalability across number of robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review at IEEE T-RO</p></details> |
| **[Robust Optimal Safe and Stability Guaranteeing Reinforcement Learning Control for Quadcopter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14003v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have provided new data-driven ways of controller design to replace the traditional manual synthesis and certification approaches. Employing neural network (NN) as controllers however, presents its own challenge: that of certifying stability due to their inherent complex nonlinearity, and while NN controllers have demonstrated high performance in complex systems, they often lack formal stability guarantees. This issue is further accentuated for critical nonlinear applications such as of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), complicating their stability guarantees, whereas a lack of stability assurance raises the risk of critical damage or even complete failure under a loss of control. In this study, we improve a Robust, Optimal, Safe and Stability Guaranteed Training (ROSS-GT) method of [1] to design an NN controller for a quadcopter flight control. The approach ensures closed-loop system stability by finding a Lyapunov function, and providing a safe initial state domain that remains invariant under the control and guarantees stability to an equilibrium within it. Stability guaranteeing constraints are derived from the sector bound of the system nonlinearity and of its parameters and disturbance variations, in the form of a Lipschitz bound for a NN control. The control performance is further optimized by searching over the class of stability-guaranteeing controllers to minimize the reference tracking error and the control costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[CarPlanner: Consistent Auto-regressive Trajectory Planning for Large-scale Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19908v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous driving, ensuring safe and efficient navigation in complex environments. While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

However, training techniques such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) require a high number of task repetitions, which are generally unsafe and impractical to perform on real surgical systems. This stresses the need for simulated surgical environments, which are not only realistic, but also computationally efficient and scalable. We introduce FF-SRL (Fast and Flexible Surgical Reinforcement Learning), a high-performance learning environment for robotic surgery. In FF-SRL both physics simulation and RL policy training reside entirely on a single GPU. This avoids typical bottlenecks associated with data transfer between the CPU and GPU, leading to accelerated learning rates. Our results show that FF-SRL reduces the training time of a complex tissue manipulation task by an order of magnitude, down to a couple of minutes, compared to a common CPU/GPU simulator. Such speed-up may facilitate the experimentation with RL techniques and contribute to the development of new generation of surgical systems. To this end, we make our code publicly available to the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adventurer: Exploration with BiGAN for Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18612v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in deep reinforcement learning have been very successful in learning complex, previously intractable problems. Sample efficiency and local optimality, however, remain significant challenges. To address these challenges, novelty-driven exploration strategies have emerged and shown promising potential. Unfortunately, no single algorithm outperforms all others in all tasks and most of them struggle with tasks with high-dimensional and complex observations. In this work, we propose Adventurer, a novelty-driven exploration algorithm that is based on Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGAN), where BiGAN is trained to estimate state novelty. Intuitively, a generator that has been trained on the distribution of visited states should only be able to generate a state coming from the distribution of visited states. As a result, novel states using the generator to reconstruct input states from certain latent representations would lead to larger reconstruction errors. We show that BiGAN performs well in estimating state novelty for complex observations. This novelty estimation method can be combined with intrinsic-reward-based exploration. Our empirical results show that Adventurer produces competitive results on a range of popular benchmark tasks, including continuous robotic manipulation tasks (e.g. Mujoco robotics) and high-dimensional image-based tasks (e.g. Atari games).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Applied Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning in Switching Non-Stationary Markov Decision Processes: Algorithms and Convergence Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18607v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning in non-stationary environments is challenging due to abrupt and unpredictable changes in dynamics, often causing traditional algorithms to fail to converge. However, in many real-world cases, non-stationarity has some structure that can be exploited to develop algorithms and facilitate theoretical analysis. We introduce one such structure, Switching Non-Stationary Markov Decision Processes (SNS-MDP), where environments switch over time based on an underlying Markov chain. Under a fixed policy, the value function of an SNS-MDP admits a closed-form solution determined by the Markov chain's statistical properties, and despite the inherent non-stationarity, Temporal Difference (TD) learning methods still converge to the correct value function. Furthermore, policy improvement can be performed, and it is shown that policy iteration converges to the optimal policy. Moreover, since Q-learning converges to the optimal Q-function, it likewise yields the corresponding optimal policy. To illustrate the practical advantages of SNS-MDPs, we present an example in communication networks where channel noise follows a Markovian pattern, demonstrating how this framework can effectively guide decision-making in complex, time-varying contexts.</p></details> |  |

Insulin delivery systems have advanced significantly, with artificial intelligence (AI) playing a key role in improving their precision and adaptability. AI algorithms, particularly those based on reinforcement learning, allow for personalised insulin dosing by continuously adapting to an individual's responses. Despite these advancements, challenges such as data privacy, algorithm transparency, and accessibility still need to be addressed. Continued progress and validation in AI-driven insulin delivery systems promise to improve therapy outcomes further, offering people more effective and individualised management of their diabetes.

| **[RLCAD: Reinforcement Learning Training Gym for Revolution Involved CAD Command Sequence Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18549v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A CAD command sequence is a typical parametric design paradigm in 3D CAD systems where a model is constructed by overlaying 2D sketches with operations such as extrusion, revolution, and Boolean operations. Although there is growing academic interest in the automatic generation of command sequences, existing methods and datasets only support operations such as 2D sketching, extrusion,and Boolean operations. This limitation makes it challenging to represent more complex geometries. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) training environment (gym) built on a CAD geometric engine. Given an input boundary representation (B-Rep) geometry, the policy network in the RL algorithm generates an action. This action, along with previously generated actions, is processed within the gym to produce the corresponding CAD geometry, which is then fed back into the policy network. The rewards, determined by the difference between the generated and target geometries within the gym, are used to update the RL network. Our method supports operations beyond sketches, Boolean, and extrusion, including revolution operations. With this training gym, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality in generating command sequences from B-Rep geometries. In addition, our method can significantly improve the efficiency of command sequence generation by a factor of 39X compared with the previous training gym.</p></details> |  |

Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods often create agents that specialize in narrow tasks, limiting their adaptability and diversity. To overcome this, we propose a preliminary, evolution-inspired framework that includes a reproduction module, similar to natural species reproduction, balancing diversity and specialization. By integrating RL, imitation learning (IL), and a coevolutionary agent-terrain curriculum, our system evolves agents continuously through complex tasks. This approach promotes adaptability, inheritance of useful traits, and continual learning. Agents not only refine inherited skills but also surpass their predecessors. Our initial experiments show that this method improves exploration efficiency and supports open-ended learning, offering a scalable solution where sparse reward coupled with diverse terrain environments induces a multi-task setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, CoRL 2024 Workshop MAPoDeL</p></details> |

In recent years, deep reinforcement learning approaches have proven to outperform model-based algorithms. Nevertheless, even though the results provided are promising, the works are not able to take advantage of the capabilities that their models offer. They usually get trapped in local optima in the training process, that prevent them from learning the optimal policy. They are not able to visit and interact with every possible state appropriately, such as with the states near the goal or near the dynamic obstacles. In this work, we propose using intrinsic rewards to balance between exploration and exploitation and explore depending on the uncertainty of the states instead of on the time the agent has been trained, encouraging the agent to get more curious about unknown states. We explain the benefits of the approach and compare it with other exploration algorithms that may be used for crowd navigation. Many simulation experiments are performed modifying several algorithms of the state-of-the-art, showing that the use of intrinsic rewards makes the robot learn faster and reach higher rewards and success rates (fewer collisions) in shorter navigation times, outperforming the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

Pretraining on vast web-scale data has laid the foundation for these models, yet the research community is now increasingly shifting focus toward post-training techniques to achieve further breakthroughs. While pretraining provides a broad linguistic foundation, post-training methods enable LLMs to refine their knowledge, improve reasoning, enhance factual accuracy, and align more effectively with user intents and ethical considerations. Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time scaling have emerged as critical strategies for optimizing LLMs performance, ensuring robustness, and improving adaptability across various real-world tasks. This survey provides a systematic exploration of post-training methodologies, analyzing their role in refining LLMs beyond pretraining, addressing key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, reward hacking, and inference-time trade-offs. We highlight emerging directions in model alignment, scalable adaptation, and inference-time reasoning, and outline future research directions.

MetaSpatial addresses two core challenges: (i) the lack of internalized 3D spatial reasoning in VLMs, which limits their ability to generate realistic layouts, and (ii) the inefficiency of traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for layout generation tasks, as perfect ground truth annotations are unavailable. Our key innovation is a multi-turn RL-based optimization mechanism that integrates physics-aware constraints and rendered image evaluations, ensuring generated 3D layouts are coherent, physically plausible, and aesthetically consistent. Methodologically, MetaSpatial introduces an adaptive, iterative reasoning process, where the VLM refines spatial arrangements over multiple turns by analyzing rendered outputs, improving scene coherence progressively. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MetaSpatial significantly enhances the spatial consistency and formatting stability of various scale models. Post-training, object placements are more realistic, aligned, and functionally coherent, validating the effectiveness of RL for 3D spatial reasoning in metaverse, AR/VR, digital twins, and game development applications. Our code, data, and training pipeline are publicly available at https://github.com/PzySeere/MetaSpatial.</p></details> | Working Paper |

Most existing studies focus on judging the final answer at the problem level, while they ignore detailed feedback on each step in a math problem-solving process, which requires abilities of semantic understanding and reasoning. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to boost large language model (LLM) for step-level automatic math correction, named StepAMC. Particularly, we convert the step-level automatic math correction within the text classification task into an RL problem to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Then, we design a space-constrained policy network to improve the stability of RL. Then, we introduce a fine-grained reward network to convert the binary human feedback into a continuous value. We conduct extensive experiments over two benchmark datasets and the results show that our model outperforms the eleven strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible. Unsupervised cross-domain Reinforcement Learning (RL) pre-training shows great potential for challenging continuous visual control but poses a big challenge. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ross-domain \textbf{R}andom \textbf{P}re-\textbf{T}raining with \textbf{pro}totypes (CRPTpro), a novel, efficient, and effective self-supervised cross-domain RL pre-training framework. CRPTpro decouples data sampling from encoder pre-training, proposing decoupled random collection to easily and quickly generate a qualified cross-domain pre-training dataset. Moreover, a novel prototypical self-supervised algorithm is proposed to pre-train an effective visual encoder that is generic across different domains. Without finetuning, the cross-domain encoder can be implemented for challenging downstream tasks defined in different domains, either seen or unseen. Compared with recent advanced methods, CRPTpro achieves better performance on downstream policy learning without extra training on exploration agents for data collection, greatly reducing the burden of pre-training. We conduct extensive experiments across eight challenging continuous visual-control domains, including balance control, robot locomotion, and manipulation. CRPTpro significantly outperforms the next best Proto-RL(C) on 11/12 cross-domain downstream tasks with only 54.5\% wall-clock pre-training time, exhibiting state-of-the-art pre-training performance with greatly improved pre-training efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Prior finite time analysis of such algorithms has focused on fixed point iterations with mappings contractive under Euclidean norm. Motivated by applications in reinforcement learning, we give the first mean square bound on non linear two-time-scale SA where the iterations have arbitrary norm contractive mappings and Markovian noise. We show that the mean square error decays at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$ in the general case, and at a rate of $O(1/n)$ in a special case where the slower timescale is noiseless. Our analysis uses the generalized Moreau envelope to handle the arbitrary norm contractions and solutions of Poisson equation to deal with the Markovian noise. By analyzing the SSP Q-Learning algorithm, we give the first $O(1/n)$ bound for an algorithm for asynchronous control of MDPs under the average reward criterion. We also obtain a rate of $O(1/n)$ for Q-Learning with Polyak-averaging and provide an algorithm for learning Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) for strongly monotone games which converges at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) 2025</p></details> |

Non-profits and governmental organizations alert about the many challenges faced by people experiencing homelessness (PEH), which include not only the lack of shelter but also the lack of opportunities for personal development. In this context, the capability approach (CA), which underpins the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), provides a comprehensive framework to assess inequity in terms of real opportunities. This paper explores how the CA can be combined with agent-based modelling and reinforcement learning. The goals are: (1) implementing the CA as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), (2) building on such MDP to develop a rich decision-making model that accounts for more complex motivators of behaviour, such as values and needs, and (3) developing an agent-based simulation framework that allows to assess alternative policies aiming to expand or restore people's capabilities. The framework is developed in a real case study of health inequity and homelessness, working in collaboration with stakeholders, non-profits and domain experts. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a novel agent-based simulation framework, rooted in the CA, which can be replicated in a diversity of social contexts to assess policies in a non-invasive way.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaMOuR: Leveraging Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17125v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated strong performance in robotic control but remains susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) states, often resulting in unreliable actions and task failure. While previous methods have focused on minimizing or preventing OOD occurrences, they largely neglect recovery once an agent encounters such states. Although the latest research has attempted to address this by guiding agents back to in-distribution states, their reliance on uncertainty estimation hinders scalability in complex environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery (LaMOuR), which enables recovery learning without relying on uncertainty estimation. LaMOuR generates dense reward codes that guide the agent back to a state where it can successfully perform its original task, leveraging the capabilities of LVLMs in image description, logical reasoning, and code generation. Experimental results show that LaMOuR substantially enhances recovery efficiency across diverse locomotion tasks and even generalizes effectively to complex environments, including humanoid locomotion and mobile manipulation, where existing methods struggle.

While existing parameter tuning methods have demonstrated considerable success, further performance improvements require a more structured approach. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical architecture for reinforcement learning-based parameter tuning. The architecture introduces a hierarchical structure with low-frequency parameter tuning, mid-frequency planning, and high-frequency control, enabling concurrent enhancement of both upper-layer parameter tuning and lower-layer control through iterative training. Experimental evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments show that our method surpasses existing parameter tuning approaches. Furthermore, our approach achieves first place in the Benchmark for Autonomous Robot Navigation (BARN) Challenge.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often fall short of achieving physics realism and supporting diverse types of interactions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a unified Human-Object Interaction framework that provides unified control over interactions with static scenes and dynamic objects using language commands. The interactions between human and object parts can always be described as the continuous stable Relative Movement Dynamics (RMD) between human and object parts. By leveraging the world knowledge and scene perception capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we translate language commands into RMD diagrams, which are used to guide goal-conditioned reinforcement learning for sequential interaction with objects. Our framework supports long-horizon interactions among dynamic, articulated, and static objects. To support the training and evaluation of our framework, we present a new dataset named Interplay, which includes multi-round task plans generated by VLMs, covering both static and dynamic HOI tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively handle a wide range of HOI tasks, showcasing its ability to maintain long-term, multi-round transitions.

| **[EPO: Explicit Policy Optimization for Strategic Reasoning in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12486v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities in well-defined problems with clear solutions, such as mathematics and coding. However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning-an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty. Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior. To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) using process rewards and iterative self-play, without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks. Our findings reveal various collaborative reasoning mechanisms emergent in EPO and its effectiveness in generating novel strategies, underscoring its potential for strategic reasoning in real-world applications.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |

Our method leverages a pretrained conditional diffusion model with Preference Latent Embeddings (PLE), trained on a large, reward-free offline dataset. The PLE serves as a compact representation for capturing specific user preferences. By adapting the pretrained model using our proposed preference inversion method, which directly optimizes the learnable PLE, we achieve superior alignment with human preferences compared to existing solutions like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). To better reflect practical applications, we create a benchmark experiment using real human preferences on diverse, high-reward trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages |

We first build a connection between Iterated CVaR RL and $(s, a)$-rectangular distributional robust RL with a specific uncertainty set for CVaR. We establish nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of this problem. Specifically, we first prove that a value iteration-based algorithm, ICVaR-VI, achieves an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with at most $\tilde{O} \left(\frac{SA}{(1-\gamma)^4\tau^2\epsilon^2} \right)$ samples, where $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $S, A$ are the sizes of the state and action spaces. Furthermore, when $\tau \geq \gamma$, the sample complexity improves to $\tilde{O} \left( \frac{SA}{(1-\gamma)^3\epsilon^2} \right)$. We further show a minimax lower bound of $\tilde{O} \left(\frac{(1-\gamma \tau)SA}{(1-\gamma)^4\tau\epsilon^2} \right)$. For a fixed risk level $\tau \in (0,1]$, our upper and lower bounds match, demonstrating the tightness and optimality of our analysis. We also investigate a limiting case with a small risk level $\tau$, called Worst-Path RL, where the objective is to maximize the minimum possible cumulative reward. We develop matching upper and lower bounds of $\tilde{O} \left(\frac{SA}{p_{\min}} \right)$, where $p_{\min}$ denotes the minimum non-zero reaching probability of the transition kernel.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Multi-Fidelity Reinforcement Learning for Variance Reduction in Engineering Design Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18229v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-fidelity Reinforcement Learning (RL) frameworks efficiently utilize computational resources by integrating analysis models of varying accuracy and costs. The prevailing methodologies, characterized by transfer learning, human-inspired strategies, control variate techniques, and adaptive sampling, predominantly depend on a structured hierarchy of models. However, this reliance on a model hierarchy can exacerbate variance in policy learning when the underlying models exhibit heterogeneous error distributions across the design space. To address this challenge, this work proposes a novel adaptive multi-fidelity RL framework, in which multiple heterogeneous, non-hierarchical low-fidelity models are dynamically leveraged alongside a high-fidelity model to efficiently learn a high-fidelity policy. Specifically, low-fidelity policies and their experience data are adaptively used for efficient targeted learning, guided by their alignment with the high-fidelity policy. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated in an octocopter design optimization problem, utilizing two low-fidelity models alongside a high-fidelity simulator. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially reduces variance in policy learning, leading to improved convergence and consistent high-quality solutions relative to traditional hierarchical multi-fidelity RL methods. Moreover, the framework eliminates the need for manually tuning model usage schedules, which can otherwise introduce significant computational overhead. This positions the framework as an effective variance-reduction strategy for multi-fidelity RL, while also mitigating the computational and operational burden of manual fidelity scheduling.</p></details> |  |
| **[SFO: Piloting VLM Feedback for Offline RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01062v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While internet-scale image and textual data have enabled strong generalization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the absence of internet-scale control data has impeded the development of similar generalization in standard reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Although VLMs are fundamentally limited in their ability to solve control tasks due to their lack of action-conditioned training data, their capacity for image understanding allows them to provide valuable feedback in RL tasks by recognizing successful outcomes. A key challenge in Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is determining how best to integrate VLM-derived signals into the learning process. We explore this question in the context of offline RL and introduce a class of methods called sub-trajectory filtered optimization. We identify three key insights. First, trajectory length plays a crucial role in offline RL, as full-trajectory preference learning exacerbates the stitching problem, necessitating the use of sub-trajectories. Second, even in Markovian environments, a non-Markovian reward signal from a sequence of images is required to assess trajectory improvement, as VLMs do not interpret control actions and must rely on visual cues over time. Third, a simple yet effective approach--filtered and weighted behavior cloning--consistently outperforms more complex reinforcement learning from human feedback-based methods. We propose sub-trajectory filtered behavior cloning, a method that leverages VLM feedback on sub-trajectories while incorporating a retrospective filtering mechanism that removes sub-trajectories preceding failures to improve robustness and prevent turbulence. This study is preliminary; we provide initial evidence through evaluations on a toy control domain.

| **[Decentralized Navigation of a Cable-Towed Load using Quadrupedal Robot Team via MARL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18221v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the challenge of enabling a team of quadrupedal robots to collaboratively tow a cable-connected load through cluttered and unstructured environments while avoiding obstacles. Leveraging cables allows the multi-robot system to navigate narrow spaces by maintaining slack when necessary. However, this introduces hybrid physical interactions due to alternating taut and slack states, with computational complexity that scales exponentially as the number of agents increases. To tackle these challenges, we developed a scalable and decentralized system capable of dynamically coordinating a variable number of quadrupedal robots while managing the hybrid physical interactions inherent in the load-towing task. At the core of this system is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based planner, designed for decentralized coordination. The MARL-based planner is trained using a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework, enabling each robot to make decisions autonomously using only local (ego) observations. To accelerate learning and ensure effective collaboration across varying team sizes, we introduce a tailored training curriculum for MARL. Experimental results highlight the flexibility and scalability of the framework, demonstrating successful deployment with one to four robots in real-world scenarios and up to twelve robots in simulation. The decentralized planner maintains consistent inference times, regardless of the team size. Additionally, the proposed system demonstrates robustness to environment perturbations and adaptability to varying load weights. This work represents a step forward in achieving flexible and efficient multi-legged robotic collaboration in complex and real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViVa: Video-Trained Value Functions for Guiding Online RL from Diverse Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18210v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online reinforcement learning (RL) with sparse rewards poses a challenge partly because of the lack of feedback on states leading to the goal. Furthermore, expert offline data with reward signal is rarely available to provide this feedback and bootstrap online learning. How can we guide online agents to the right solution without this on-task data? Reward shaping offers a solution by providing fine-grained signal to nudge the policy towards the optimal solution. However, reward shaping often requires domain knowledge to hand-engineer heuristics for a specific goal. To enable more general and inexpensive guidance, we propose and analyze a data-driven methodology that automatically guides RL by learning from widely available video data such as Internet recordings, off-task demonstrations, task failures, and undirected environment interaction. By learning a model of optimal goal-conditioned value from diverse passive data, we open the floor to scaling up and using various data sources to model general goal-reaching behaviors relevant to guiding online RL. Specifically, we use intent-conditioned value functions to learn from diverse videos and incorporate these goal-conditioned values into the reward. Our experiments show that video-trained value functions work well with a variety of data sources, exhibit positive transfer from human video pre-training, can generalize to unseen goals, and scale with dataset size.</p></details> |  |

Heuristics are commonly used to address this complexity, yet they often face limitations in scope and scalability. Recent research has found deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to be a promising alternative to traditional heuristics, offering greater versatility by utilizing dynamic decision-making capabilities. However, since DRL is known to struggle with the curse of dimensionality, its relevance to complex real-life supply chain scenarios is still to be determined. This thesis investigates DRL's applicability to MEIO problems of increasing complexity. A state-of-the-art DRL model was replicated, enhanced, and tested across 13 supply chain scenarios, combining diverse network structures and parameters. To address DRL's challenges with dimensionality, additional models leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) were developed, culminating in the novel iterative multi-agent reinforcement learning (IMARL) approach. IMARL demonstrated superior scalability, effectiveness, and reliability in optimizing inventory policies, consistently outperforming benchmarks. These findings confirm the potential of DRL, particularly IMARL, to address real-world supply chain challenges and call for additional research to further expand its applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>A Cap...</summary><p>A Capstone Report in the Field of Data Science for the Degree of Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies - Harvard University</p></details> |

With the rise of service robots, socially aware navigation has gained prominence. However, existing approaches primarily predict pedestrian movements or issue alerts, lacking true human-robot interaction. We introduce Hybrid Soft Actor-Critic with Large Language Model (HSAC-LLM), a novel framework for socially aware navigation. By integrating deep reinforcement learning with large language models, HSAC-LLM enables bidirectional natural language interactions, predicting both continuous and discrete navigation actions. When potential collisions arise, the robot proactively communicates with pedestrians to determine avoidance strategies. Experiments in 2D simulation, Gazebo, and real-world environments demonstrate that HSAC-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DRL methods in interaction, navigation, and obstacle avoidance. This paradigm advances effective human-robot interactions in dynamic settings. Videos are available at https://hsacllm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

We validate the continuous AIF model against both a perfect optimization baseline and a reinforcement learning-based approach. We also test the community AIF framework under extreme pricing scenarios. The results highlight the model's robustness in handling abrupt changes.

Despite their strong instruction-following capabilities, these models frequently struggled to align with user intent in coding scenarios. In particular, they were hampered by datasets that lacked diversity and failed to address specialized tasks or edge cases. Furthermore, challenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise, human-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code generation performance for automated programming systems, we propose Feedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization (i.e., FALCON). FALCON is structured into two hierarchical levels. From the global level, long-term memory improves code quality by retaining and applying learned knowledge. At the local level, short-term memory allows for the incorporation of immediate feedback from compilers and AI systems. Additionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to solve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's adaptability across diverse code generation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art performance, leading other reinforcement learning methods by more than 4.5 percentage points on the MBPP benchmark and 6.1 percentage points on the Humaneval benchmark.

| **[Mitigating Reward Over-Optimization in RLHF via Behavior-Supported Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18130v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an effective method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, reward over-optimization remains an open challenge leading to discrepancies between the performance of LLMs under the reward model and the true human objectives. A primary contributor to reward over-optimization is the extrapolation error that arises when the reward model evaluates out-of-distribution (OOD) responses. However, current methods still fail to prevent the increasing frequency of OOD response generation during the reinforcement learning (RL) process and are not effective at handling extrapolation errors from OOD responses. In this work, we propose the Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO) method to mitigate the reward over-optimization issue. Specifically, we define behavior policy as the next token distribution of the reward training dataset to model the in-distribution (ID) region of the reward model. Building on this, we introduce the behavior-supported Bellman operator to regularize the value function, penalizing all OOD values without impacting the ID ones. Consequently, BSPO reduces the generation of OOD responses during the RL process, thereby avoiding overestimation caused by the reward model's extrapolation errors. Theoretically, we prove that BSPO guarantees a monotonic improvement of the supported policy until convergence to the optimal behavior-supported policy. Empirical results from extensive experiments show that BSPO outperforms baselines in preventing reward over-optimization due to OOD evaluation and finding the optimal ID policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Surrogate Learning in Meta-Black-Box Optimization: A Preliminary Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18060v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) approaches have shown possibility of enhancing the optimization performance through learning meta-level policies to dynamically configure low-level optimizers. However, existing MetaBBO approaches potentially consume massive function evaluations to train their meta-level policies. Inspired by the recent trend of using surrogate models for cost-friendly evaluation of expensive optimization problems, in this paper, we propose a novel MetaBBO framework which combines surrogate learning process and reinforcement learning-aided Differential Evolution algorithm, namely Surr-RLDE, to address the intensive function evaluation in MetaBBO. Surr-RLDE comprises two learning stages: surrogate learning and policy learning. In surrogate learning, we train a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with a novel relative-order-aware loss to accurately approximate the objective functions of the problem instances used for subsequent policy learning. In policy learning, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically configure the mutation operator in DE. The learned surrogate model is integrated into the training of the RL-based policy to substitute for the original objective function, which effectively reduces consumed evaluations during policy learning.

Though promising, existing MetaBBO methods heavily rely on human-crafted feature extraction approach to secure learning effectiveness. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel MetaBBO method that supports automated feature learning during the meta-learning process, termed as RLDE-AFL, which integrates a learnable feature extraction module into a reinforcement learning-based DE method to learn both the feature encoding and meta-level policy. Specifically, we design an attention-based neural network with mantissa-exponent based embedding to transform the solution populations and corresponding objective values during the low-level optimization into expressive landscape features. We further incorporate a comprehensive algorithm configuration space including diverse DE operators into a reinforcement learning-aided DAC paradigm to unleash the behavior diversity and performance of the proposed RLDE-AFL. Extensive benchmark results show that co-training the proposed feature learning module and DAC policy contributes to the superior optimization performance of RLDE-AFL to several advanced DE methods and recent MetaBBO baselines over both synthetic and realistic BBO scenarios.

Recently, preference optimization, derived from the language domain, has emerged as an effective post-training reinforcement strategy to enhance capabilities of LVLMs. However, constructing high-quality human-annotated preference data and developing robust reward models to mimic these preferences are both costly and challenging. Motivated by this observation, we propose Vision-R1, a novel vision-guided R1-like reinforcement learning algorithm for LVLMs that rewards models with definitive vision feedback. It only leverages curated instruction data, eliminating the need for specialized reward models and handcrafted preference datasets. We incorporate a criterion-driven reward function that further integrates multi-dimensional feedback to evaluate model completions comprehensively based on the vision task logic. Furthermore, we introduce a progressive rule refinement strategy that dynamically adjusts the reward criteria during training, enabling continuous model improvement and mitigating reward hacking. Extensive experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning the 7B LVLMs with Vision-R1 achieves consistent performance gains, with even up to 50% improvement and surpassing the state-of-the-art 10x size model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project in development.

Though reinforcement learning from human feedback offers promise for preference alignment, existing reward models for visual generation face limitations, including black-box scoring without interpretability and potentially resultant unexpected biases. We present VisionReward, a general framework for learning human visual preferences in both image and video generation. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical visual assessment framework to capture fine-grained human preferences, and leverages linear weighting to enable interpretable preference learning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-dimensional consistent strategy when using VisionReward as a reward model during preference optimization for visual generation. Experiments show that VisionReward can significantly outperform existing image and video reward models on both machine metrics and human evaluation. Notably, VisionReward surpasses VideoScore by 17.2% in preference prediction accuracy, and text-to-video models with VisionReward achieve a 31.6% higher pairwise win rate compared to the same models using VideoScore.

In such tasks, how do target values and their prevalence influence foraging and eye movement behaviors (e.g., should you prioritize rare quarters or common nickels)? To explore this, we conducted human psychophysics experiments, revealing that humans are proficient reward foragers. Their eye fixations are drawn to regions with higher average rewards, fixation durations are longer on more valuable targets, and their cumulative rewards exceed chance, approaching the upper bound of optimal foragers. To probe these decision-making processes of humans, we developed a transformer-based Visual Forager (VF) model trained via reinforcement learning. Our VF model takes a series of targets, their corresponding values, and the search image as inputs, processes the images using foveated vision, and produces a sequence of eye movements along with decisions on whether to collect each fixated item. Our model outperforms all baselines, achieves cumulative rewards comparable to those of humans, and approximates human foraging behavior in eye movements and foraging biases within time-limited environments. Furthermore, stress tests on out-of-distribution tasks with novel targets, unseen values, and varying set sizes demonstrate the VF model's effective generalization. Our work offers valuable insights into the relationship between eye movements and decision-making, with our model serving as a powerful tool for further exploration of this connection. All data, code, and models are available at https://github.com/ZhangLab-DeepNeuroCogLab/visual-forager.</p></details> |  |

The framework employs a hierarchical decision-making structure with conditional action masking, where high-level actions direct the robot's exploration, while low-level actions optimize its navigation and efficient chemical spraying in affected areas. The key objectives of optimization include improving the coverage of infected areas with limited battery power and reducing chemical usage, thus preventing unnecessary spraying of healthy areas of the field. Our numerical experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, Hierarchical Action Masking Proximal Policy Optimization (HAM-PPO), significantly outperforms baseline practices, such as LawnMower navigation + indiscriminate spraying (Carpet Spray), in terms of yield recovery and resource efficiency. HAM-PPO consistently achieves higher yield recovery percentages and lower chemical costs across a range of infection scenarios. The framework also exhibits robustness to observation noise and generalizability under diverse environmental conditions, adapting to varying infection ranges and spatial distribution patterns.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

However, the ease of achieving this similarity raises concerns from potential malicious uses at scale by bad actors, as LLM-generated text becomes increasingly difficult to discern from human text. Although detection methods have been developed to address this issue, bad actors can further manipulate LLM-generated texts to make them less detectable. In this work, we study how further editing texts with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which aligns model outputs with human preferences, affects (a) the quality of generated texts for two tasks, and (b) the performance of LLM-generated text detectors, looking at both training-based and zero-shot detection methods. Although RLHF improves the quality of LLM-generated texts, we find that it also tends to produce more detectable, lengthy, and repetitive outputs. Additionally, we observe that training-based detectors are vulnerable to short texts and to texts that incorporate code, whereas zero-shot detectors exhibit greater robustness.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

This paper studies assembly sequence planning (ASP) for physical combinatorial assembly. Given the shape of the desired object, the goal is to find a sequence of actions for placing unit primitives to build the target object. In particular, we aim to ensure the planned assembly sequence is physically executable. However, ASP for combinatorial assembly is particularly challenging due to its combinatorial nature. To address the challenge, we employ deep reinforcement learning to learn a construction policy for placing unit primitives sequentially to build the desired object. Specifically, we design an online physics-aware action mask that filters out invalid actions, which effectively guides policy learning and ensures violation-free deployment. In the end, we apply the proposed method to Lego assembly with more than 250 3D structures. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method plans physically valid assembly sequences to build all structures, achieving a $100\%$ success rate, whereas the best comparable baseline fails more than $40$ structures.

Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2 reasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences improve performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due to verbose and redundant outputs, known as the "overthinking phenomenon". In this paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically investigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient reasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we categorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based efficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models into more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning models; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to dynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input prompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency based on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control. Additionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning models, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and discuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://github.com/Eclipsess/Awesome-Efficient-Reasoning-LLMs</p></details> |

In this paper, we study building blocks for self-supervised RL that unlock substantial improvements in scalability, with network depth serving as a critical factor. Whereas most RL papers in recent years have relied on shallow architectures (around 2 - 5 layers), we demonstrate that increasing the depth up to 1024 layers can significantly boost performance. Our experiments are conducted in an unsupervised goal-conditioned setting, where no demonstrations or rewards are provided, so an agent must explore (from scratch) and learn how to maximize the likelihood of reaching commanded goals. Evaluated on simulated locomotion and manipulation tasks, our approach increases performance by $2\times$ - $50\times$. Increasing the model depth not only increases success rates but also qualitatively changes the behaviors learned.</p></details> | <details><summary>Link ...</summary><p>Link to project website: https://wang-kevin3290.github.io/scaling-crl/</p></details> |

While most IRL algorithms' theoretical guarantees rely on a linear reward structure, we aim to extend the theoretical understanding of IRL to scenarios where the reward function is parameterized by neural networks. Meanwhile, conventional IRL algorithms usually adopt a nested structure, leading to computational inefficiency, especially in high-dimensional settings. To address this problem, we propose the first two-timescale single-loop IRL algorithm under neural network parameterized reward and provide a non-asymptotic convergence analysis under overparameterization. Although prior optimality results for linear rewards do not apply, we show that our algorithm can identify the globally optimal reward and policy under certain neural network structures. This is the first IRL algorithm with a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee that provably achieves global optimality in neural network settings.</p></details> |  |

Battery-powered WSNs offer various advantages over wired systems, however limited battery life has always been one of the biggest obstacles in practical use of the WSNs, regardless of energy harvesting methods. While various methods have been studied for battery health management, existing methods exclusively aim to extend lifetime of individual batteries, lacking a system level view. A consequence of applying such methods is that batteries in a WSN tend to fail at different times, posing significant difficulty on planning and scheduling of battery replacement trip. This study investigate a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for active battery degradation management by optimizing duty cycle of WSNs at the system level. This active management strategy effectively reduces earlier failure of battery individuals which enable group replacement without sacrificing WSN performances. A simulated environment based on a real-world WSN setup was developed to train a DRL agent and learn optimal duty cycle strategies. The performance of the strategy was validated in a long-term setup with various network sizes, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability.</p></details> |  |

In response, we propose CP-AgentNet, the first framework designed to use generative agents for developing communication network protocols. This approach addresses these challenges by creating an autonomous system for protocol design, significantly reducing human effort. We developed LLMA (LLM-agents-based multiple access) and CPTCP (CP-Agent-based TCP) for heterogeneous environments. Our comprehensive simulations have demonstrated the efficient coexistence of LLMA and CPTCP with nodes using different types of protocols, as well as enhanced explainability.</p></details> |  |

While Policy Gradient (PG) methods have been developed for risk-sensitive RL, it remains unclear if these methods enjoy the same global convergence guarantees as in the risk-neutral case \citep{mei2020global,agarwal2021theory,cen2022fast,bhandari2024global}. In this paper, we consider a class of dynamic time-consistent risk measures, named Expected Conditional Risk Measures (ECRMs), and derive PG and Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) updates for ECRMs-based RL problems. We provide global optimality {and iteration complexities} of the proposed algorithms under the following four settings: (i) PG with constrained direct parameterization, (ii) PG with softmax parameterization and log barrier regularization, (iii) NPG with softmax parameterization and entropy regularization, and (iv) approximate NPG with inexact policy evaluation. Furthermore, we test a risk-averse REINFORCE algorithm \citep{williams1992simple} and a risk-averse NPG algorithm \citep{kakade2001natural} on a stochastic Cliffwalk environment to demonstrate the efficacy of our methods and the importance of risk control.</p></details> |  |

However, applications of causal reasoning to Multi-Agent RL (MARL) are still mostly unexplored. In this paper, we take the first step in investigating the opportunities and challenges of applying causal reasoning in MARL. We measure the impact of a simple form of causal augmentation in state-of-the-art MARL scenarios increasingly requiring cooperation, and with state-of-the-art MARL algorithms exploiting various degrees of collaboration between agents. Then, we discuss the positive as well as negative results achieved, giving us the chance to outline the areas where further research may help to successfully transfer causal RL to the multi-agent setting.</p></details> |  |

Requesting bandwidth in advance can mitigate the impact of these fluctuations and ensure timely access to critical resources. In a multi-Mobile Network Operator (MNO) environment, vehicles need to select cost-effective and reliable resources for their safety-critical applications. This research aims to minimize resource costs by finding the best price among multiple MNOs. It formulates multi-operator scenarios as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), utilizing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, specifically Dueling Deep Q-Learning. For efficient and stable learning, we propose a novel area-wise approach and an adaptive MDP synthetic close to the real environment. The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) is used to handle time-dependent data and model training. Furthermore, the research leverages Amazon spot price data and adopts a multi-phase training approach, involving initial training on synthetic data, followed by real-world data. These phases enable the DRL agent to make informed decisions using insights from historical data and real-time observations. The results show that our model leads to significant cost reductions, up to 40%, compared to scenarios without a policy model in such a complex environment.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

However, the increasing integration of renewable energy introduces uncertainties for real-time scheduling. Existing solutions face limitations both in modeling and algorithmic design. At the modeling level, they fail to incorporate widely adopted virtual power plants (VPPs) as flexibility resources, missing the opportunity to proactively mitigate potential real-time imbalances or ramping constraints through foresight-seeing decision-making. At the algorithmic level, existing probabilistic optimization, multi-stage approaches, and machine learning, face challenges in computational complexity and adaptability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel two-stage UC framework that incorporates foresight-seeing sequential decision-making in both day-ahead and real-time scheduling, leveraging VPPs as flexibility resources to proactively reserve capacity and ramping flexibility for upcoming renewable energy uncertainties over several hours. In particular, we develop quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) algorithms that integrate the foresight-seeing sequential decision-making and scalable computation advantages of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the parallel and high-efficiency search capabilities of quantum computing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QRL-based approach outperforms in computational efficiency, real-time responsiveness, and solution quality.</p></details> |  |

Albeit its demonstrated agility, traditional Model-Free RL (MFRL) solutions struggle to tackle the huge action space, which generally explodes exponentially along with the number of resource allocation units, enduring low sampling efficiency and high interaction cost. In contrast to MFRL, Model-Based RL (MBRL) offers an alternative solution to boost sample efficiency and stabilize the training by explicitly leveraging a learned environment model. However, establishing an accurate dynamic model for complex and noisy environments necessitates a careful balance between model accuracy and computational complexity $\&$ stability. To address these issues, we propose a Conditional Diffusion Model Planner (CDMP) for high-dimensional offline resource allocation in clustered ad hoc networks. By leveraging the astonishing generative capability of Diffusion Models (DMs), our approach enables the accurate modeling of high-quality environmental dynamics while leveraging an inverse dynamics model to plan a superior policy. Beyond simply adopting DMs in offline RL, we further incorporate the CDMP algorithm with a theoretically guaranteed, uncertainty-aware penalty metric, which theoretically and empirically manifests itself in mitigating the Out-of-Distribution (OOD)-induced distribution shift issue underlying scarce training data. Extensive experiments also show that our model outperforms MFRL in average reward and Quality of Service (QoS) while demonstrating comparable performance to other MBRL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

How can we ensure that MLLMs are safely aligned to prevent undesired behaviors such as discrimination, misinformation, or violations of ethical standards? In a further step, we need to explore how to fine-tune MLLMs to enhance reasoning performance while ensuring they satisfy safety constraints. Fundamentally, this can be formulated as a min-max optimization problem. In this study, we propose Safe RLHF-V, the first multimodal safety alignment framework that jointly optimizes helpfulness and safety using separate multimodal reward and cost models within a Lagrangian-based constrained optimization framework. Given that there is a lack of preference datasets that separate helpfulness and safety in multimodal scenarios, we introduce BeaverTails-V, the first open-source dataset with dual preference annotations for helpfulness and safety, along with multi-level safety labels (minor, moderate, severe). Additionally, we design a Multi-level Guardrail System to proactively defend against unsafe queries and adversarial attacks. By applying the Beaver-Guard-V moderation for 5 rounds of filtering and re-generation on the precursor model, the overall safety of the upstream model is significantly improved by an average of 40.9%. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning different MLLMs with Safe RLHF can effectively enhance model helpfulness while ensuring improved safety. Specifically, Safe RLHF-V improves model safety by 34.2% and helpfulness by 34.3%. All of datasets, models, and code can be found at https://github.com/SafeRLHF-V to support the safety development of MLLMs and reduce potential societal risks.</p></details> |  |

An important challenge is accurately quantifying the uncertainty of unknown models to generate provably safe control policies that facilitate the gathering of informative data, thereby achieving both safe and optimal policies. Additionally, the selection of the data-driven model can significantly impact both the real-time implementation and the uncertainty quantification process. In this paper, we propose a provably sample efficient episodic safe learning framework that remains robust across various model choices with quantified uncertainty for online control tasks. Specifically, we first employ Quadrature Fourier Features (QFF) for kernel function approximation of Gaussian Processes (GPs) to enable efficient approximation of unknown dynamics. Then the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) is used to quantify the uncertainty from online observations and combined with the Control Barrier Functions (CBF) to characterize the uncertainty-aware safe control constraints under learned dynamics. Finally, an optimism-based exploration strategy is integrated with ACP-based CBFs for safe exploration and near-optimal safe nonlinear control. Theoretical proofs and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, the intricate connections between nodes and diverse modules often present a steep learning curve for users. In this paper, we introduce ComfyGPT, the first self-optimizing multi-agent system designed to generate ComfyUI workflows based on task descriptions automatically. ComfyGPT comprises four specialized agents: ReformatAgent, FlowAgent, RefineAgent, and ExecuteAgent. The core innovation of ComfyGPT lies in two key aspects. First, it focuses on generating individual node links rather than entire workflows, significantly improving generation precision. Second, we proposed FlowAgent, a LLM-based workflow generation agent that uses both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to improve workflow generation accuracy. Moreover, we introduce FlowDataset, a large-scale dataset containing 13,571 workflow-description pairs, and FlowBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating workflow generation systems. We also propose four novel evaluation metrics: Format Validation (FV), Pass Accuracy (PA), Pass Instruct Alignment (PIA), and Pass Node Diversity (PND). Experimental results demonstrate that ComfyGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based methods in workflow generation.</p></details> |  |

However, their lack of emotion and fine-grained role awareness limits the model's ability to provide personalized and diverse interactions further. Current methods face high costs in collecting high-quality annotated data for scenarios such as role-playing, and traditional human alignment methods are difficult to deploy due to the inherent diversity of model behavior in role-playing scenarios. Inspired by the alignment of models for safety behaviors through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), in this paper, we revisit model role-playing behavior from the perspective of persona alignment and propose a novel annotation-free framework named \textbf{\underline{P}}ersona-Aware \textbf{\underline{C}}ontrastive \textbf{\underline{L}}earning (PCL) to align LLMs' behavior during role-playing, enhancing the model's role consistency. Specifically, we first design a role chain method to encourage the model to self-question based on the role characteristics and dialogue context to adjust personality consistency. Then, we further enhance the model's role-playing strategy through iterative contrastive learning between the use of role characteristics and not. Experiments on both black-box and white-box LLMs show that LLMs equipped with PCL significantly outperform vanilla LLMs under automatic evaluation methods (CharEval \& GPT-4) and human expert evaluation.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

This challenge stems from behavioral intent requiring simultaneous achievement of multiple competing objectives, typically addressed through labor-intensive linear reward composition that yields brittle results. Consider the ubiquitous robotics scenario where performance maximization directly conflicts with energy conservation. Such competitive dynamics are resistant to simple linear reward combinations. In this paper, we present the concept of objective fulfillment upon which we build Fulfillment Priority Logic (FPL). FPL allows practitioners to define logical formula representing their intentions and priorities within multi-objective reinforcement learning. Our novel Balanced Policy Gradient algorithm leverages FPL specifications to achieve up to 500\% better sample efficiency compared to Soft Actor Critic. Notably, this work constitutes the first implementation of non-linear utility scalarization design, specifically for continuous control problems.</p></details> |  |

While several principled algorithmic frameworks have been proposed, key theoretical foundations, particularly those related to sample complexity, remain underexplored. Understanding and deriving tight sample complexity bounds are crucial for bridging the gap between theory and practice, guiding the development of more efficient algorithms. In this work, we present the first sample complexity result for BRL, achieving a bound of $\epsilon^{-4}$. This result extends to standard bilevel optimization problems, providing an interesting theoretical contribution with practical implications. To address the computational challenges associated with hypergradient estimation in bilevel optimization, we develop a first-order Hessian-free algorithm that does not rely on costly hypergradient computations. By leveraging matrix-free techniques and constrained optimization methods, our approach ensures scalability and practicality. Our findings pave the way for improved methods in AI alignment and other fields reliant on bilevel optimization.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of interpretability limits their practical use, particularly in critical decision-making scenarios. Post-hoc interpretability, which provides explanations for pre-trained models, is often at risk of robustness and fidelity. This has inspired a rising interest in self-interpretable neural networks, which inherently reveal the prediction rationale through the model structures. Although there exist surveys on post-hoc interpretability, a comprehensive and systematic survey of self-interpretable neural networks is still missing. To address this gap, we first collect and review existing works on self-interpretable neural networks and provide a structured summary of their methodologies from five key perspectives: attribution-based, function-based, concept-based, prototype-based, and rule-based self-interpretation. We also present concrete, visualized examples of model explanations and discuss their applicability across diverse scenarios, including image, text, graph data, and deep reinforcement learning. Additionally, we summarize existing evaluation metrics for self-interpretability and identify open challenges in this field, offering insights for future research. To support ongoing developments, we present a publicly accessible resource to track advancements in this domain: https://github.com/yangji721/Awesome-Self-Interpretable-Neural-Network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable Latent-to-Latent Locomotion Policy for Efficient and Versatile Motion Control of Diverse Legged Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17626v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable capability in acquiring robot skills, but learning each new skill still requires substantial data collection for training. The pretrain-and-finetune paradigm offers a promising approach for efficiently adapting to new robot entities and tasks. Inspired by the idea that acquired knowledge can accelerate learning new tasks with the same robot and help a new robot master a trained task, we propose a latent training framework where a transferable latent-to-latent locomotion policy is pretrained alongside diverse task-specific observation encoders and action decoders. This policy in latent space processes encoded latent observations to generate latent actions to be decoded, with the potential to learn general abstract motion skills. To retain essential information for decision-making and control, we introduce a diffusion recovery module that minimizes information reconstruction loss during pretrain stage. During fine-tune stage, the pretrained latent-to-latent locomotion policy remains fixed, while only the lightweight task-specific encoder and decoder are optimized for efficient adaptation. Our method allows a robot to leverage its own prior experience across different tasks as well as the experience of other morphologically diverse robots to accelerate adaptation. We validate our approach through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating that the pretrained latent-to-latent locomotion policy effectively generalizes to new robot entities and tasks with improved efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Dynamic Trend Filtering through Trend Point Detection with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03665v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trend filtering simplifies complex time series data by applying smoothness to filter out noise while emphasizing proximity to the original data. However, existing trend filtering methods fail to reflect abrupt changes in the trend due to `approximateness,' resulting in constant smoothness. This approximateness uniformly filters out the tail distribution of time series data, characterized by extreme values, including both abrupt changes and noise. In this paper, we propose Trend Point Detection formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), a novel approach to identifying essential points that should be reflected in the trend, departing from approximations. We term these essential points as Dynamic Trend Points (DTPs) and extract trends by interpolating them. To identify DTPs, we utilize Reinforcement Learning (RL) within a discrete action space and a forecasting sum-of-squares loss function as a reward, referred to as the Dynamic Trend Filtering network (DTF-net). DTF-net integrates flexible noise filtering, preserving critical original subsequences while removing noise as required for other subsequences. We demonstrate that DTF-net excels at capturing abrupt changes compared to other trend filtering algorithms and enhances forecasting performance, as abrupt changes are predicted rather than smoothed out.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

This study presents a dynamic feature selection method based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning, combined with typical machine learning models, aimed at improving the classification accuracy of hazardous states under complex operating conditions. Firstly, this work innovatively employs a fiber rod-based MEMS attitude sensor to collect vibration data from the robot and extract high-dimensional feature vectors in both time and frequency domains. Then, a reinforcement learning model is used to dynamically select the optimal feature subset, reducing feature redundancy and enhancing classification accuracy. Finally, a CNN-LSTM deep learning model is employed for classification and recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the robot's ability to assess hazardous states across various operational scenarios, providing reliable technical support for robotic safety monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures, manuscript for Journal of Autonomous Robots</p></details> |
| **[BAMDP Shaping: a Unified Framework for Intrinsic Motivation and Reward Shaping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05358v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrinsic motivation and reward shaping guide reinforcement learning (RL) agents by adding pseudo-rewards, which can lead to useful emergent behaviors. However, they can also encourage counterproductive exploits, e.g., fixation with noisy TV screens. Here we provide a theoretical model which anticipates these behaviors, and provides broad criteria under which adverse effects can be bounded. We characterize all pseudo-rewards as reward shaping in Bayes-Adaptive Markov Decision Processes (BAMDPs), which formulates the problem of learning in MDPs as an MDP over the agent's knowledge. Optimal exploration maximizes BAMDP state value, which we decompose into the value of the information gathered and the prior value of the physical state. Psuedo-rewards guide RL agents by rewarding behavior that increases these value components, while they hinder exploration when they align poorly with the actual value. We extend potential-based shaping theory to prove BAMDP Potential-based shaping Functions (BAMPFs) are immune to reward-hacking (convergence to behaviors maximizing composite rewards to the detriment of real rewards) in meta-RL, and show empirically how a BAMPF helps a meta-RL agent learn optimal RL algorithms for a Bernoulli Bandit domain. We finally prove that BAMPFs with bounded monotone increasing potentials also resist reward-hacking in the regular RL setting. We show that it is straightforward to retrofit or design new pseudo-reward terms in this form, and provide an empirical demonstration in the Mountain Car environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This problem is an extension of the traditional 2D packing problem, incorporating an additional constraint on the height dimension. Therefore, a simulator using the OpenAI Gym framework has been developed to efficiently simulate the packing of rectangular pieces onto two boards with height constraints. Furthermore, the simulator supports multidiscrete actions, enabling the selection of a position on either board and the type of piece to place. Finally, two DRL-based methods (Proximal Policy Optimization -- PPO and the Advantage Actor-Critic -- A2C) have been employed to learn a packing strategy and demonstrate its performance compared to a well-known heuristic baseline (MaxRect-BL). In the experiments carried out, the PPO-based approach proved to be a good solution for solving complex packaging problems and highlighted its potential to optimize resource utilization in various industrial applications, such as the manufacturing of aerospace composites.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 figures, Accepted for presentation at ICEIS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Autonomous Radiotherapy Treatment Planning Using DOLA: A Privacy-Preserving, LLM-Based Optimization Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17553v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiotherapy treatment planning is a complex and time-intensive process, often impacted by inter-planner variability and subjective decision-making. To address these challenges, we introduce Dose Optimization Language Agent (DOLA), an autonomous large language model (LLM)-based agent designed for optimizing radiotherapy treatment plans while rigorously protecting patient privacy. DOLA integrates the LLaMa3.1 LLM directly with a commercial treatment planning system, utilizing chain-of-thought prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and reinforcement learning (RL). Operating entirely within secure local infrastructure, this agent eliminates external data sharing. We evaluated DOLA using a retrospective cohort of 18 prostate cancer patients prescribed 60 Gy in 20 fractions, comparing model sizes (8 billion vs. 70 billion parameters) and optimization strategies (No-RAG, RAG, and RAG+RL) over 10 planning iterations. The 70B model demonstrated significantly improved performance, achieving approximately 16.4% higher final scores than the 8B model. The RAG approach outperformed the No-RAG baseline by 19.8%, and incorporating RL accelerated convergence, highlighting the synergy of retrieval-based memory and reinforcement learning. Optimal temperature hyperparameter analysis identified 0.4 as providing the best balance between exploration and exploitation. This proof of concept study represents the first successful deployment of locally hosted LLM agents for autonomous optimization of treatment plans within a commercial radiotherapy planning system. By extending human-machine interaction through interpretable natural language reasoning, DOLA offers a scalable and privacy-conscious framework, with significant potential for clinical implementation and workflow improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, preprint</p></details> |
| **[What's Producible May Not Be Reachable: Measuring the Steerability of Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17482v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How should we evaluate the quality of generative models? Many existing metrics focus on a model's producibility, i.e. the quality and breadth of outputs it can generate. However, the actual value from using a generative model stems not just from what it can produce but whether a user with a specific goal can produce an output that satisfies that goal. We refer to this property as steerability. In this paper, we first introduce a mathematical framework for evaluating steerability independently from producibility. Steerability is more challenging to evaluate than producibility because it requires knowing a user's goals. We address this issue by creating a benchmark task that relies on one key idea: sample an output from a generative model and ask users to reproduce it. We implement this benchmark in a large-scale user study of text-to-image models and large language models. Despite the ability of these models to produce high-quality outputs, they all perform poorly on steerabilty. This suggests that we need to focus on improving the steerability of generative models. We show such improvements are indeed possible: through reinforcement learning techniques, we create an alternative steering mechanism for image models that achieves more than 2x improvement on this benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Value Function Estimation Under Model Mismatch: A Federated Temporal Difference Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17454v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) enables collaborative learning while preserving data privacy by preventing direct data exchange between agents. However, many existing FedRL algorithms assume that all agents operate in identical environments, which is often unrealistic. In real-world applications -- such as multi-robot teams, crowdsourced systems, and large-scale sensor networks -- each agent may experience slightly different transition dynamics, leading to inherent model mismatches. In this paper, we first establish linear convergence guarantees for single-agent temporal difference learning (TD(0)) in policy evaluation and demonstrate that under a perturbed environment, the agent suffers a systematic bias that prevents accurate estimation of the true value function. This result holds under both i.i.d. and Markovian sampling regimes. We then extend our analysis to the federated TD(0) (FedTD(0)) setting, where multiple agents -- each interacting with its own perturbed environment -- periodically share value estimates to collaboratively approximate the true value function of a common underlying model. Our theoretical results indicate the impact of model mismatch, network connectivity, and mixing behavior on the convergence of FedTD(0). Empirical experiments corroborate our theoretical gains, highlighting that even moderate levels of information sharing can significantly mitigate environment-specific errors.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by these findings, our study investigates whether similar reasoning capabilities can be successfully integrated into large vision-language models (LVLMs) and assesses their impact on challenging multimodal reasoning tasks. We consider an approach that iteratively leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on lightweight training data and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to further improve model generalization. Initially, reasoning capabilities were distilled from pure-text R1 models by generating reasoning steps using high-quality captions of the images sourced from diverse visual datasets. Subsequently, iterative RL training further enhance reasoning skills, with each iteration's RL-improved model generating refined SFT datasets for the next round. This iterative process yielded OpenVLThinker, a LVLM exhibiting consistently improved reasoning performance on challenging benchmarks such as MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision, demonstrating the potential of our strategy for robust vision-language reasoning.

We argue that this is unlikely to be a good design choice in contexts with high potential for disagreement, like in the training of large language models. We propose a method to specialise a reward model to a person or group of people. Our approach builds on the observation that individual preferences can be captured as a linear combination of a set of general reward features. We show how to learn such features and subsequently use them to quickly adapt the reward model to a specific individual, even if their preferences are not reflected in the training data. We present experiments with large language models comparing the proposed architecture with a non-adaptive reward model and also adaptive counterparts, including models that do in-context personalisation. Depending on how much disagreement there is in the training data, our model either significantly outperforms the baselines or matches their performance with a simpler architecture and more stable training.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the former first splits the original training data into three different levels by the input prompt length, and then the latter leverages segmented training datasets with a progressively increasing context window length to train the reasoning model. Experimental results demonstrate that \textbf{\textsc{FastCuRL}}-1.5B-Preview surpasses DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview across all five datasets (including MATH 500, AIME 2024, AMC 2023, Minerva Math, and OlympiadBench) while only utilizing 50\% of training steps.

Beyond NLP, LLMs are increasingly used in software development tasks, such as code completion, modification, bug fixing, and code translation. Software engineers widely use tools like GitHub Copilot and Amazon Q, streamlining workflows and automating tasks with high accuracy. While the resource and energy intensity of LLM training is often highlighted, inference can be even more resource-intensive over time, as it's a continuous process with a high number of invocations. Therefore, developing resource-efficient alternatives for LLM inference is crucial for sustainability. This work proposes GREEN-CODE, a framework for energy-aware code generation in LLMs. GREEN-CODE performs dynamic early exit during LLM inference. We train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that learns to balance the trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and energy consumption. Our approach is evaluated on two open-source LLMs, Llama 3.2 3B and OPT 2.7B, using the JavaCorpus and PY150 datasets. Results show that our method reduces the energy consumption between 23-50 % on average for code generation tasks without significantly affecting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission in ACM/IEEE conference, 11 pages</p></details> |

Each container has two optimal emptying volumes that trade off higher throughput against overflow risk. Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches struggle under delayed rewards, sparse critical events, and high-dimensional uncertainty -- failing to consistently balance higher-volume empties with the risk of safety-limit violations. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid method comprising: (1) a curriculum-learning pipeline that incrementally trains a PPO agent to handle delayed rewards and class imbalance, and (2) an offline pairwise collision model used at inference time to proactively avert collisions with minimal online cost. Experimental results show that our targeted inference-time collision checks significantly improve collision avoidance, reduce safety-limit violations, maintain high throughput, and scale effectively across varying container-to-PU ratios. These findings offer actionable guidelines for designing safe and efficient container-management systems in real-world facilities.</p></details> |  |

The difficulty lies in finding a good representation for the current task so that the agent understands how it relates to previously seen tasks. To achieve zero-shot transfer, we introduce the function encoder, a representation learning algorithm which represents a function as a weighted combination of learned, non-linear basis functions. By using a function encoder to represent the reward function or the transition function, the agent has information on how the current task relates to previously seen tasks via a coherent vector representation. Thus, the agent is able to achieve transfer between related tasks at run time with no additional training. We demonstrate state-of-the-art data efficiency, asymptotic performance, and training stability in three RL fields by augmenting basic RL algorithms with a function encoder task representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>A cri...</summary><p>A critical issue was found in the multi-agent experiments published in version 2.

The key aspect of RM-driven RL is the exploitation of a finite-state machine that decomposes the agent's task into different subtasks. PROB-IRM uses a state-of-the-art inductive logic programming framework robust to noisy examples to learn RMs from noisy traces using the Bayesian posterior degree of beliefs, thus ensuring robustness against inconsistencies. Pivotal for the results is the interleaving between RM learning and policy learning: a new RM is learned whenever the RL agent generates a trace that is believed not to be accepted by the current RM. To speed up the training of the RL agent, PROB-IRM employs a probabilistic formulation of reward shaping that uses the posterior Bayesian beliefs derived from the traces. Our experimental analysis shows that PROB-IRM can learn (potentially imperfect) RMs from noisy traces and exploit them to train an RL agent to solve its tasks successfully. Despite the complexity of learning the RM from noisy traces, agents trained with PROB-IRM perform comparably to agents provided with handcrafted RMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 21st International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR 2024)</p></details> |

Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CLaMP-DPO in symbolic music generation models with different architectures and encoding schemes. Furthermore, subjective A/B tests show that NotaGen outperforms baseline models against human compositions, greatly advancing musical aesthetics in symbolic music generation.</p></details> |  |

We propose DITTO, an offline imitation learning algorithm which addresses all three of these problems. DITTO optimizes a novel distance metric in the latent space of a learned world model: First, we train a world model on all available trajectory data, then, the imitation agent is unrolled from expert start states in the learned model, and penalized for its latent divergence from the expert dataset over multiple time steps. We optimize this multi-step latent divergence using standard reinforcement learning algorithms, which provably induces imitation learning, and empirically achieves state-of-the art performance and sample efficiency on a range of Atari environments from pixels, without any online environment access. We also adapt other standard imitation learning algorithms to the world model setting, and show that this considerably improves their performance. Our results show how creative use of world models can lead to a simple, robust, and highly-performant policy-learning framework.</p></details> |  |

To improve deep reinforcement learning, the Least Squares Deep Q Network (LS-DQN) method was proposed by Levine et al., which combines Deep Q Network (DQN) with LR method. However, the LS-DQN method assumes that the actions are discrete. In this study, we propose the Double Least Squares Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DLS-DDPG) method to address this limitation. This method combines the LR method with the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) technique, one of the representative deep reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous action cases. Numerical experiments conducted in MuJoCo environments showed that the LR update improved performance at least in some tasks, although there are difficulties such as the inability to make the regularization terms small.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |

The system uses neural-guided Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and supports both supervised and reinforcement learning, with a search space defined by a context-free grammar. We summarize seven desirable properties of equation discovery systems, emphasizing the importance of embedding tabular data sets for such learning approaches. Using the modular structure of MGMT, we compare seven architectures (among them, RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers) for embedding tabular datasets on the auxiliary task of contrastive learning for tabular data sets on an equation discovery task. For almost all combinations of modules, supervised learning outperforms reinforcement learning. Moreover, our experiments indicate an advantage of using grammar rules as action space instead of tokens. Two adaptations of MCTS -- risk-seeking MCTS and AmEx-MCTS -- can improve equation discovery with that kind of search.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages + 4 pages appendix, 9 figures, book chapter</p></details> |

They require re-segmentation of the path when the routing changes. Furthermore, they do not consider the flow table issuance time, which cannot maximize the speed of issuance flow table. To address these issues, this paper establishes an optimization model that can simultaneously form routing strategies and path segmentation strategies for selecting the appropriate swap nodes to reduce flow table issuance time. It also designs an intelligent segment routing algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL-SR) to solve the proposed model. First, a traffic matrix is designed as the state space for the deep reinforcement learning agent; this matrix includes multiple QoS performance indicators, flow table issuance time overhead and SR label stack depth. Second, the action selection strategy and corresponding reward function are designed, where the agent selects the next node considering the routing; in addition, the action selection strategy whether the newly added node is selected as the swap node and the corresponding reward function are designed considering the time cost factor for the controller to issue the flow table to the swap node. Finally, a series of experiments and their results show that, compared with the existing methods, the designed segmented route optimization model and the intelligent solution algorithm (DRL-SR) can reduce the time overhead required to complete the segmented route establishment task while optimizing performance metrics such as throughput, delays and packet losses.</p></details> |  |

In this framework, the DT model to be built at the cloud is regarded as a global one being split into and integrating from multiple functional components, i.e., partial-DTs, created at various edge servers (ESs) using feature data collected by associated sensors. Considering time-varying DT evolutions and heterogeneities among partial-DTs, we formulate an online problem that jointly and dynamically optimizes partial-DT assignments from the cloud to ESs, ES-sensor associations for partial-DT creation, and as well as computation and communication resource allocations for global-DT integration. The problem aims to maximize the constructed DT's model quality while minimizing all induced costs, including energy consumption and configuration costs, in long runs. To this end, we first transform the original problem into an equivalent hierarchical game with an upper-layer two-sided matching game and a lower-layer overlapping coalition formation game. After analyzing these games in detail, we apply the Gale-Shapley algorithm and particularly develop a switch rules-based overlapping coalition formation algorithm to obtain short-term equilibria of upper-layer and lower-layer subgames, respectively. Then, we design a deep reinforcement learning-based solution, called DMO, to extend the result into a long-term equilibrium of the hierarchical game, thereby producing the solution to the original problem. Simulations show the effectiveness of the introduced framework, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution over counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[STP: Self-play LLM Theorem Provers with Iterative Conjecturing and Proving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00212v4)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in formal theorem proving by LLMs is the lack of high-quality training data. Although reinforcement learning or expert iteration partially mitigates this issue by alternating between LLM generating proofs and finetuning them on correctly generated ones, performance quickly plateaus due to the scarcity of correct proofs (sparse rewards). To keep improving the models with limited data, we draw inspiration from mathematicians, who continuously develop new results, partly by proposing novel conjectures or exercises (which are often variants of known results) and attempting to solve them. We design the Self-play Theorem Prover (STP) that simultaneously takes on two roles, conjecturer and prover, each providing training signals to the other. The conjecturer is trained iteratively on previously generated conjectures that are barely provable by the current prover, which incentivizes it to generate increasingly challenging conjectures over time. The prover attempts to prove the conjectures with standard expert iteration. We evaluate STP with both Lean and Isabelle formal versifiers. With 51.3 billion tokens generated during the training in Lean, STP proves 28.5% of the statements in the LeanWorkbook dataset, doubling the previous best result of 13.2% achieved through expert iteration.

| **[Prioritized Trajectory Replay: A Replay Memory for Data-driven Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15503v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, data-driven reinforcement learning (RL), also known as offline RL, have gained significant attention. However, the role of data sampling techniques in offline RL has been overlooked despite its potential to enhance online RL performance. Recent research suggests applying sampling techniques directly to state-transitions does not consistently improve performance in offline RL. Therefore, in this study, we propose a memory technique, (Prioritized) Trajectory Replay (TR/PTR), which extends the sampling perspective to trajectories for more comprehensive information extraction from limited data. TR enhances learning efficiency by backward sampling of trajectories that optimizes the use of subsequent state information. Building on TR, we build the weighted critic target to avoid sampling unseen actions in offline training, and Prioritized Trajectory Replay (PTR) that enables more efficient trajectory sampling, prioritized by various trajectory priority metrics. We demonstrate the benefits of integrating TR and PTR with existing offline RL algorithms on D4RL. In summary, our research emphasizes the significance of trajectory-based data sampling techniques in enhancing the efficiency and performance of offline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAMAS 2024, see https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3635637.3662980</p></details> |
| **[Causally Aligned Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16799v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A pervasive challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the "curse of dimensionality" which is the exponential growth in the state-action space when optimizing a high-dimensional target task. The framework of curriculum learning trains the agent in a curriculum composed of a sequence of related and more manageable source tasks. The expectation is that when some optimal decision rules are shared across source tasks and the target task, the agent could more quickly pick up the necessary skills to behave optimally in the environment, thus accelerating the learning process. However, this critical assumption of invariant optimal decision rules does not necessarily hold in many practical applications, specifically when the underlying environment contains unobserved confounders. This paper studies the problem of curriculum RL through causal lenses. We derive a sufficient graphical condition characterizing causally aligned source tasks, i.e., the invariance of optimal decision rules holds. We further develop an efficient algorithm to generate a causally aligned curriculum, provided with qualitative causal knowledge of the target task. Finally, we validate our proposed methodology through experiments in discrete and continuous confounded tasks with pixel observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Posters in ICLR 2024</p></details> |

However, their capabilities in handling complex financial tasks still require in-depth exploration. In this paper, we introduce Fin-R1, a reasoning large language model specifically designed for the financial sector. Fin-R1 is built using a two-stage architecture, leveraging a financial reasoning dataset distilled and processed based on DeepSeek-R1. Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) training, it demonstrates performance close to DeepSeek-R1 with a parameter size of 7 billion across a range of financial reasoning tasks. It achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in the FinQA and ConvFinQA tasks between those LLMs in our evaluation, surpassing larger models in other tasks as well. Fin-R1 showcases strong reasoning and decision-making capabilities, providing solutions to various problems encountered in the financial domain.

| **[Towards Automated Semantic Interpretability in Reinforcement Learning via Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16724v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic Interpretability in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables transparency, accountability, and safer deployment by making the agent's decisions understandable and verifiable. Achieving this, however, requires a feature space composed of human-understandable concepts, which traditionally rely on human specification and fail to generalize to unseen environments. In this work, we introduce Semantically Interpretable Reinforcement Learning with Vision-Language Models Empowered Automation (SILVA), an automated framework that leverages pre-trained vision-language models (VLM) for semantic feature extraction and interpretable tree-based models for policy optimization. SILVA first queries a VLM to identify relevant semantic features for an unseen environment, then extracts these features from the environment. Finally, it trains an Interpretable Control Tree via RL, mapping the extracted features to actions in a transparent and interpretable manner. To address the computational inefficiency of extracting features directly with VLMs, we develop a feature extraction pipeline that generates a dataset for training a lightweight convolutional network, which is subsequently used during RL. By leveraging VLMs to automate tree-based RL, SILVA removes the reliance on human annotation previously required by interpretable models while also overcoming the inability of VLMs alone to generate valid robot policies, enabling semantically interpretable reinforcement learning without human-in-the-loop.</p></details> |  |
| **[Likelihood Reward Redistribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17409v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many practical reinforcement learning scenarios, feedback is provided only at the end of a long horizon, leading to sparse and delayed rewards. Existing reward redistribution methods typically assume that per-step rewards are independent, thus overlooking interdependencies among state--action pairs. In this paper, we propose a \emph{Likelihood Reward Redistribution} (LRR) framework that addresses this issue by modeling each per-step reward with a parametric probability distribution whose parameters depend on the state--action pair. By maximizing the likelihood of the observed episodic return via a leave-one-out (LOO) strategy that leverages the entire trajectory, our framework inherently introduces an uncertainty regularization term into the surrogate objective. Moreover, we show that the conventional mean squared error (MSE) loss for reward redistribution emerges as a special case of our likelihood framework when the uncertainty is fixed under the Gaussian distribution. When integrated with an off-policy algorithm such as Soft Actor-Critic, LRR yields dense and informative reward signals, resulting in superior sample efficiency and policy performance on Box-2d and MuJoCo benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Q-Learning with Gradient Target Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16700v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Q-learning with gradient target tracking, a novel reinforcement learning framework that provides a learned continuous target update mechanism as an alternative to the conventional hard update paradigm. In the standard deep Q-network (DQN), the target network is a copy of the online network's weights, held fixed for a number of iterations before being periodically replaced via a hard update. While this stabilizes training by providing consistent targets, it introduces a new challenge: the hard update period must be carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose two gradient-based target update methods: DQN with asymmetric gradient target tracking (AGT2-DQN) and DQN with symmetric gradient target tracking (SGT2-DQN). These methods replace the conventional hard target updates with continuous and structured updates using gradient descent, which effectively eliminates the need for manual tuning. We provide a theoretical analysis proving the convergence of these methods in tabular settings. Additionally, empirical evaluations demonstrate their advantages over standard DQN baselines, which suggest that gradient-based target updates can serve as an effective alternative to conventional target update mechanisms in Q-learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATOM: A Framework of Detecting Query-Based Model Extraction Attacks for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16693v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained traction in Graph-based Machine Learning as a Service (GMLaaS) platforms, yet they remain vulnerable to graph-based model extraction attacks (MEAs), where adversaries reconstruct surrogate models by querying the victim model. Existing defense mechanisms, such as watermarking and fingerprinting, suffer from poor real-time performance, susceptibility to evasion, or reliance on post-attack verification, making them inadequate for handling the dynamic characteristics of graph-based MEA variants. To address these limitations, we propose ATOM, a novel real-time MEA detection framework tailored for GNNs. ATOM integrates sequential modeling and reinforcement learning to dynamically detect evolving attack patterns, while leveraging $k$-core embedding to capture the structural properties, enhancing detection precision. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to characterize query behaviors and optimize detection strategies. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ATOM outperforms existing approaches in detection performance, maintaining stable across different time steps, thereby offering a more effective defense mechanism for GMLaaS environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Whenever, Wherever: Towards Orchestrating Crowd Simulations with Spatio-Temporal Spawn Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16639v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic crowd simulations are essential for immersive virtual environments, relying on both individual behaviors (microscopic dynamics) and overall crowd patterns (macroscopic characteristics). While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Utilizing Reinforcement Learning for Bottom-Up part-wise Reconstruction of 2D Wire-Frame Projections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16629v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work concerns itself with the task of reconstructing all edges of an arbitrary 3D wire-frame model projected to an image plane. We explore a bottom-up part-wise procedure undertaken by an RL agent to segment and reconstruct these 2D multipart objects. The environment's state is represented as a four-colour image, where different colours correspond to background, a target edge, a reconstruction line, and the overlap of both. At each step, the agent can transform the reconstruction line within a four-dimensional action space or terminate the episode using a specific termination action. To investigate the impact of reward function formulations, we tested episodic and incremental rewards, as well as combined approaches. Empirical results demonstrated that the latter yielded the most effective training performance. To further enhance efficiency and stability, we introduce curriculum learning strategies. First, an action-based curriculum was implemented, where the agent was initially restricted to a reduced action space, being able to only perform three of the five possible actions, before progressing to the full action space. Second, we test a task-based curriculum, where the agent first solves a simplified version of the problem before being presented with the full, more complex task. This second approach produced promising results, as the agent not only successfully transitioned from learning the simplified task to mastering the full task, but in doing so gained significant performance. This study demonstrates the potential of an iterative RL wire-frame reconstruction in two dimensions. By combining optimized reward function formulations with curriculum learning strategies, we achieved significant improvements in training success. The proposed methodology provides an effective framework for solving similar tasks and represents a promising direction for future research in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RLDM 2025</p></details> |

In its current implementation, DIDP guides the search using user-defined dual bounds. Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly being applied to combinatorial optimization problems and shares several key structures with DP, being represented by the Bellman equation and state-based transition systems. We propose using reinforcement learning to obtain a heuristic function to guide the search in DIDP. We develop two RL-based guidance approaches: value-based guidance using Deep Q-Networks and policy-based guidance using Proximal Policy Optimization. Our experiments indicate that RL-based guidance significantly outperforms standard DIDP and problem-specific greedy heuristics with the same number of node expansions. Further, despite longer node evaluation times, RL guidance achieves better run-time performance than standard DIDP on three of four benchmark domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, to be published in CPAIOR 2025 (https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2025)</p></details> |
| **[Navigating Demand Uncertainty in Container Shipping: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Enabling Adaptive and Feasible Master Stowage Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12756v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in solving various combinatorial optimization problems. However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we focus on using RL in container shipping, often considered the cornerstone of global trade, by dealing with the critical challenge of master stowage planning. The main objective is to maximize cargo revenue and minimize operational costs while navigating demand uncertainty and various complex operational constraints, namely vessel capacity and stability, which must be dynamically updated along the vessel's voyage. To address this problem, we implement a deep reinforcement learning framework with feasibility projection to solve the master stowage planning problem (MPP) under demand uncertainty. The experimental results show that our architecture efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions for this multi-stage stochastic optimization problem, outperforming traditional mixed-integer programming and RL with feasibility regularization. Our AI-driven decision-support policy enables adaptive and feasible planning under uncertainty, optimizing operational efficiency and capacity utilization while contributing to sustainable and resilient global supply chains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review for IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

Our study investigates the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning in small LLMs, focusing on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, under strict constraints: training on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs (48 GB VRAM each) within 24 hours. Adapting the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curating a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, we conducted three experiments to explore model behavior and performance. Our results demonstrate rapid reasoning gains - e.g., AMC23 accuracy rising from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing o1-preview - using only 7,000 samples and a $42 training cost, compared to thousands of dollars for baseline models. However, challenges such as optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. These findings highlight the efficacy of RL-based fine-tuning for small LLMs, offering a cost-effective alternative to large-scale approaches. We release our code and datasets as open-source resources, providing insights into trade-offs and laying a foundation for scalable, reasoning-capable LLMs in resource-limited environments.

| **[Autonomous Generation of Sub-goals for Lifelong Learning in Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18914v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the challenges of open-ended learning in robots is the need to autonomously discover goals and learn skills to achieve them. However, when in lifelong learning settings, it is always desirable to generate sub-goals with their associated skills, without relying on explicit reward, as steppingstones to a goal. This allows sub-goals and skills to be reused to facilitate achieving other goals. This work proposes a two-pronged approach for sub-goal generation to address this challenge: a top-down approach, where sub-goals are hierarchically derived from general goals using intrinsic motivations to discover them, and a bottom-up approach, where sub-goal chains emerge from making latent relationships between goals and perceptual classes that were previously learned in different domains explicit. These methods help the robot to autonomously generate and chain sub-goals as a way to achieve more general goals. Additionally, they create more abstract representations of goals, helping to reduce sub-goal duplication and make the learning of skills more efficient. Implemented within an existing cognitive architecture for lifelong open-ended learning and tested with a real robot, our approach enhances the robot's ability to discover and achieve goals, generate sub-goals in an efficient manner, generalize learned skills, and operate in dynamic and unknown environments without explicit intermediate rewards.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Existing state-of-the-art algorithms, such as FACMAC, rely on global reward information, which may not accurately reflect the quality of individual robots' actions in decentralized systems. We integrate the concept of locality into critic learning, where strongly related robots form partitions during training. Robots within the same partition have a greater impact on each other, leading to more precise policy evaluation. Additionally, we construct a dependency graph to capture the relationships between robots, facilitating the partitioning process. This approach mitigates the curse of dimensionality and prevents robots from using irrelevant information. Our method improves existing algorithms by focusing on local rewards and leveraging partition-based learning to enhance training efficiency and performance. We evaluate the performance of Loc-FACMAC in three environments: Hallway, Multi-cartpole, and Bounded-Cooperative-Navigation. We explore the impact of partition sizes on the performance and compare the result with baseline MARL algorithms such as LOMAQ, FACMAC, and QMIX. The experiments reveal that, if the locality structure is defined properly, Loc-FACMAC outperforms these baseline algorithms up to 108\%, indicating that exploiting the locality structure in the actor-critic framework improves the MARL performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Double Oracle Algorithm for Game-Theoretic Robot Allocation on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11791v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of game-theoretic robot allocation where two players strategically allocate robots to compete for multiple sites of interest. Robots possess offensive or defensive capabilities to interfere and weaken their opponents to take over a competing site. This problem belongs to the conventional Colonel Blotto Game. Considering the robots' heterogeneous capabilities and environmental factors, we generalize the conventional Blotto game by incorporating heterogeneous robot types and graph constraints that capture the robot transitions between sites. Then we employ the Double Oracle Algorithm (DOA) to solve for the Nash equilibrium of the generalized Blotto game. Particularly, for cyclic-dominance-heterogeneous (CDH) robots that inhibit each other, we define a new transformation rule between any two robot types. Building on the transformation, we design a novel utility function to measure the game's outcome quantitatively. Moreover, we rigorously prove the correctness of the designed utility function. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of DOA on computing Nash equilibrium for homogeneous, linear heterogeneous, and CDH robot allocation on graphs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are often limited by prerequisites such as camera calibration or the need for controlled environments (e.g., green screen setups). In this work, we introduce RoboEngine, the first plug-and-play visual robot data augmentation toolkit. For the first time, users can effortlessly generate physics- and task-aware robot scenes with just a few lines of code. To achieve this, we present a novel robot scene segmentation dataset, a generalizable high-quality robot segmentation model, and a fine-tuned background generation model, which together form the core components of the out-of-the-box toolkit. Using RoboEngine, we demonstrate the ability to generalize robot manipulation tasks across six entirely new scenes, based solely on demonstrations collected from a single scene, achieving a more than 200% performance improvement compared to the no-augmentation baseline. All datasets, model weights, and the toolkit will be publicly released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://roboengine.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Physics-Informed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Multi-Robot Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00212v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The networked nature of multi-robot systems presents challenges in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Centralized control policies do not scale with increasing numbers of robots, whereas independent control policies do not exploit the information provided by other robots, exhibiting poor performance in cooperative-competitive tasks. In this work we propose a physics-informed reinforcement learning approach able to learn distributed multi-robot control policies that are both scalable and make use of all the available information to each robot. Our approach has three key characteristics. First, it imposes a port-Hamiltonian structure on the policy representation, respecting energy conservation properties of physical robot systems and the networked nature of robot team interactions. Second, it uses self-attention to ensure a sparse policy representation able to handle time-varying information at each robot from the interaction graph. Third, we present a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm parameterized by our self-attention port-Hamiltonian control policy, which accounts for the correlation among robots during training while overcoming the need of value function factorization. Extensive simulations in different multi-robot scenarios demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, surpassing previous multi-robot reinforcement learning solutions in scalability, while achieving similar or superior performance (with averaged cumulative reward up to x2 greater than the state-of-the-art with robot teams x6 larger than the number of robots at training time). We also validate our approach on multiple real robots in the Georgia Tech Robotarium under imperfect communication, demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and scalability across number of robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review at IEEE T-RO</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Continual Adaptation of Pretrained Robotic Policy with Online Meta-Learned Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18684v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual adaptation is essential for general autonomous agents. For example, a household robot pretrained with a repertoire of skills must still adapt to unseen tasks specific to each household. Motivated by this, building upon parameter-efficient fine-tuning in language models, prior works have explored lightweight adapters to adapt pretrained policies, which can preserve learned features from the pretraining phase and demonstrate good adaptation performances. However, these approaches treat task learning separately, limiting knowledge transfer between tasks. In this paper, we propose Online Meta-Learned adapters (OMLA). Instead of applying adapters directly, OMLA can facilitate knowledge transfer from previously learned tasks to current learning tasks through a novel meta-learning objective. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that OMLA can lead to better adaptation performances compared to the baseline methods.

However, training techniques such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) require a high number of task repetitions, which are generally unsafe and impractical to perform on real surgical systems. This stresses the need for simulated surgical environments, which are not only realistic, but also computationally efficient and scalable. We introduce FF-SRL (Fast and Flexible Surgical Reinforcement Learning), a high-performance learning environment for robotic surgery. In FF-SRL both physics simulation and RL policy training reside entirely on a single GPU. This avoids typical bottlenecks associated with data transfer between the CPU and GPU, leading to accelerated learning rates. Our results show that FF-SRL reduces the training time of a complex tissue manipulation task by an order of magnitude, down to a couple of minutes, compared to a common CPU/GPU simulator. Such speed-up may facilitate the experimentation with RL techniques and contribute to the development of new generation of surgical systems. To this end, we make our code publicly available to the community.</p></details> |  |

Thus, a planning for a deployment is required, before sending the robots. The obstacles, the limited communication range, and the need of communicating to a base station, constrain the connectivity of the team and the deployment planning. We propose a method consisting of three algorithms: a distributed path planner to obtain communication-aware trajectories; a deployment planner providing dual-use of the robots, visiting primary goals and performing connectivity tasks; and a clustering algorithm to allocate the tasks to robots, and obtain the best goal visit order for the mission.</p></details> |  |

When a robot lacks the necessary tools to accomplish a task requested by a human, it autonomously designs the required instruments and learns how to use them to achieve the goal. Evolution 6.0 is an autonomous robotic system powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Vision-Language Action (VLA) models, and Text-to-3D generative models for tool design and task execution. The system comprises two key modules: the Tool Generation Module, which fabricates task-specific tools from visual and textual data, and the Action Generation Module, which converts natural language instructions into robotic actions. It integrates QwenVLM for environmental understanding, OpenVLA for task execution, and Llama-Mesh for 3D tool generation. Evaluation results demonstrate a 90% success rate for tool generation with a 10-second inference time, and action generation achieving 83.5% in physical and visual generalization, 70% in motion generalization, and 37% in semantic generalization. Future improvements will focus on bimanual manipulation, expanded task capabilities, and enhanced environmental interpretation to improve real-world adaptability.</p></details> | Submitted to IROS |
| **[Improving robot navigation in crowded environments using intrinsic rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06554v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous navigation in crowded environments is an open problem with many applications, essential for the coexistence of robots and humans in the smart cities of the future. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning approaches have proven to outperform model-based algorithms. Nevertheless, even though the results provided are promising, the works are not able to take advantage of the capabilities that their models offer. They usually get trapped in local optima in the training process, that prevent them from learning the optimal policy. They are not able to visit and interact with every possible state appropriately, such as with the states near the goal or near the dynamic obstacles. In this work, we propose using intrinsic rewards to balance between exploration and exploitation and explore depending on the uncertainty of the states instead of on the time the agent has been trained, encouraging the agent to get more curious about unknown states. We explain the benefits of the approach and compare it with other exploration algorithms that may be used for crowd navigation. Many simulation experiments are performed modifying several algorithms of the state-of-the-art, showing that the use of intrinsic rewards makes the robot learn faster and reach higher rewards and success rates (fewer collisions) in shorter navigation times, outperforming the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

However, it has fundamental limitations in out-of-distribution failures that persist due to compounding errors and its limited capability to extrapolate. One way to address these limitations is robot-gated DAgger, an interactive imitation learning with a robot query system to actively seek expert help during policy rollout. While robot-gated DAgger has high potential for learning at scale, existing methods like Ensemble-DAgger struggle with highly expressive policies: They often misinterpret policy disagreements as uncertainty at multi-modal decision points. To address this problem, we introduce Diff-DAgger, an efficient robot-gated DAgger algorithm that leverages the training objective of diffusion policy. We evaluate Diff-DAgger across different robot tasks including stacking, pushing, and plugging, and show that Diff-DAgger improves the task failure prediction by 39.0%, the task completion rate by 20.6%, and reduces the wall-clock time by a factor of 7.8.

We introduce an innovative multimodal odometry approach using inputs from GPR, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a wheel encoder. To efficiently address GPR signal noise, we introduce an advanced feature representation called the subsurface feature matrix (SFM). The SFM leverages frequency domain data and identifies peaks within radar scans. Additionally, we propose a novel feature matching method that estimates GPR displacement by aligning SFMs. The integrations from these three input sources are consolidated using a factor graph approach to achieve multimodal robot odometry. Our method has been developed and evaluated with the CMU-GPR public dataset, demonstrating improvements in accuracy and robustness with real-time performance in robotic odometry tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional fixed-view camera systems face challenges adapting to change viewpoints and scale variations, limiting perception and manipulation precision. To tackle these issues, we propose the Active Vision-driven Robotic (AVR) framework, a teleoperation hardware solution that supports dynamic viewpoint and dynamic focal length adjustments to continuously center targets and maintain optimal scale, accompanied by a corresponding algorithm that effectively enhances the success rates of various operational tasks. Using the RoboTwin platform with a real-time image processing plugin, AVR framework improves task success rates by 5%-16% on five manipulation tasks. Physical deployment on a dual-arm system demonstrates in collaborative tasks and 36% precision in screwdriver insertion, outperforming baselines by over 25%. Experimental results confirm that AVR framework enhances environmental perception, manipulation repeatability (40% $\le $1 cm error), and robustness in complex scenarios, paving the way for future robotic precision manipulation methods in the pursuit of human-level robot dexterity and precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Previ...</summary><p>Previously, there were some problems with our experimental data, and the conclusions need to be further verified.

However, these approaches pretrain only on 2D images, while many robotics applications require 3D scene understanding. In this work, we propose 3D-MVP, a novel approach for 3D Multi-View Pretraining using masked autoencoders. We leverage Robotic View Transformer (RVT), which uses a multi-view transformer to understand the 3D scene and predict gripper pose actions. We split RVT's multi-view transformer into visual encoder and action decoder, and pretrain its visual encoder using masked autoencoding on large-scale 3D datasets such as Objaverse. We evaluate 3D-MVP on a suite of virtual robot manipulation tasks and demonstrate improved performance over baselines. Our results suggest that 3D-aware pretraining is a promising approach to improve generalization of vision-based robotic manipulation policies.

In this study, we explore how regular interactions with a social robot, conducted in a structured yet familiar environment within university halls and departments, can provide effective support for emotion regulation through cognitive reappraisal. Twenty-one students participated in a five-session study at a university hall or department, where the robot facilitated structured conversations, encouraging the students to reinterpret emotionally charged situations that they shared with the robot. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate significant improvements in emotion self-regulation, with participants reporting better understanding and control of their emotions. The intervention led to significant changes in constructive emotion regulation tendencies and positive effects on mood and sentiment after each session. The findings also demonstrate that repeated interactions with the robot encouraged greater emotional expressiveness, including longer speech disclosures, increased use of affective language, and heightened facial arousal. Notably, expressiveness followed structured patterns aligned with the reappraisal process, with expression peaking during key reappraisal moments, particularly when participants were prompted to reinterpret negative experiences. The qualitative feedback further highlighted how the robot fostered introspection and provided a supportive space for discussing emotions, enabling participants to confront long-avoided emotional challenges. These findings demonstrate the potential of robots to effectively assist in emotion regulation in familiar environments, offering both emotional support and cognitive guidance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decentralized Navigation of a Cable-Towed Load using Quadrupedal Robot Team via MARL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18221v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the challenge of enabling a team of quadrupedal robots to collaboratively tow a cable-connected load through cluttered and unstructured environments while avoiding obstacles. Leveraging cables allows the multi-robot system to navigate narrow spaces by maintaining slack when necessary. However, this introduces hybrid physical interactions due to alternating taut and slack states, with computational complexity that scales exponentially as the number of agents increases. To tackle these challenges, we developed a scalable and decentralized system capable of dynamically coordinating a variable number of quadrupedal robots while managing the hybrid physical interactions inherent in the load-towing task. At the core of this system is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based planner, designed for decentralized coordination. The MARL-based planner is trained using a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework, enabling each robot to make decisions autonomously using only local (ego) observations. To accelerate learning and ensure effective collaboration across varying team sizes, we introduce a tailored training curriculum for MARL. Experimental results highlight the flexibility and scalability of the framework, demonstrating successful deployment with one to four robots in real-world scenarios and up to twelve robots in simulation. The decentralized planner maintains consistent inference times, regardless of the team size. Additionally, the proposed system demonstrates robustness to environment perturbations and adaptability to varying load weights. This work represents a step forward in achieving flexible and efficient multi-legged robotic collaboration in complex and real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Socially-Aware Robot Navigation Enhanced by Bidirectional Natural Language Conversations Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04965v2)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot navigation is crucial across various domains, yet traditional methods focus on efficiency and obstacle avoidance, often overlooking human behavior in shared spaces. With the rise of service robots, socially aware navigation has gained prominence. However, existing approaches primarily predict pedestrian movements or issue alerts, lacking true human-robot interaction. We introduce Hybrid Soft Actor-Critic with Large Language Model (HSAC-LLM), a novel framework for socially aware navigation. By integrating deep reinforcement learning with large language models, HSAC-LLM enables bidirectional natural language interactions, predicting both continuous and discrete navigation actions. When potential collisions arise, the robot proactively communicates with pedestrians to determine avoidance strategies. Experiments in 2D simulation, Gazebo, and real-world environments demonstrate that HSAC-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DRL methods in interaction, navigation, and obstacle avoidance. This paradigm advances effective human-robot interactions in dynamic settings. Videos are available at https://hsacllm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Data-Centric Revisit of Pre-Trained Vision Models for Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06960v2)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision models (PVMs) are fundamental to modern robotics, yet their optimal configuration remains unclear. Through systematic evaluation, we find that while DINO and iBOT outperform MAE across visuomotor control and perception tasks, they struggle when trained on non-(single-)object-centric (NOC) data--a limitation strongly correlated with their diminished ability to learn object-centric representations. This investigation indicates that the ability to form object-centric representations from the non-object-centric robotics dataset is the key to success for PVMs. Motivated by this discovery, we designed SlotMIM, a method that induces object-centric representations by introducing a semantic bottleneck to reduce the number of prototypes to encourage the emergence of objectness as well as cross-view consistency regularization for encouraging multiview invariance. Our experiments encompass pre-training on object-centric, scene-centric, web-crawled, and ego-centric data. Across all settings, our approach learns transferrable representations and achieves significant improvements over prior work in image recognition, scene understanding, and robot learning evaluations. When scaled up with million-scale datasets, our method also demonstrates superior data efficiency and scalability. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/SlotMIM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

This motivates our present work where we developed a data-driven model predictive controller (MPC) based on the Koopman operator framework, allowing the embedding of nonlinear dynamics in a higher dimensional, but linear function space. The controller, termed adaptive Koopman model predictive control (KMPC), uses online closed-loop feedback to learn and incrementally update a linear representation of nonlinear system dynamics, without the prior knowledge of a model. Adaptive KMPC differs from most other Koopman-based control frameworks that aim to identify high-validity-range models in advance and then enter closed-loop control without further model adaptations. To validate the controller, trajectory tracking experiments are conducted with 1R and 2R robots under force disturbances and changing model parameters. We compare the controller to classical linearization MPC and Koopman-based MPC without model updates, denoted static KMPC. The results show that adaptive KMPC can, opposed to static KMPC, generalize over unforeseen force disturbances and can, opposed to linearization MPC, handle varying dynamic parameters, while using a small set of basis functions to approximate the Koopman operator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to IROS 2025; See supplementary material at https://github.com/adrianodelr/adaptive-koopman-mpc</p></details> |

However, 3DGS-based methods in robotics primarily focus on static scenes, with limited attention to the dynamic scene changes essential for long-term service robots. These robots demand sustained task execution and efficient scene updates-challenges current approaches fail to meet. To address these limitations, we propose GS-LTS (Gaussian Splatting for Long-Term Service), a 3DGS-based system enabling indoor robots to manage diverse tasks in dynamic environments over time. GS-LTS detects scene changes (e.g., object addition or removal) via single-image change detection, employs a rule-based policy to autonomously collect multi-view observations, and efficiently updates the scene representation through Gaussian editing. Additionally, we propose a simulation-based benchmark that automatically generates scene change data as compact configuration scripts, providing a standardized, user-friendly evaluation benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate GS-LTS's advantages in reconstruction, navigation, and superior scene updates-faster and higher quality than the image training baseline-advancing 3DGS for long-term robotic operations.

| **[Adaptive Perching and Grasping by Aerial Robot with Light-weight and High Grip-force Tendon-driven Three-fingered Hand using Single Actuator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17711v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In previous research, various types of aerial robots equipped with perching mechanisms have been developed to extend operational time. However, most existing perching methods adopt either an upward or downward approach, making it difficult to perch near walls with surrounding obstacles. Additionally, perching hands are typically designed solely for attachment to objects and lack additional functionality, imposing a payload burden during flight. To address these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight robotic hand, the "Tri-force hand", capable of both perching and object grasping, as well as a new perching method called "Pendulum-perching". The Tri-force hand is a tendon-driven, three-fingered hand utilizing a spherical joint and a two-dimensional differential plate, enabling passive actuation with a single actuator. Each finger module, designed with controllable semi-tendon drive, can conform to arbitrary shapes within its operating range, allowing both perching and adaptive object grasping. By integrating this hand into a fully actuated aerial robot, the system can perform multi-directional approaches from the side and landing using gravity. This approach is similar to Crush-perching seen in researches with fixed-wing aerial robots, but it differs in its superior control over approach speed and direction, as well as its ability to achieve stable detachment and re-launch. In experiments, the fabricated Tri-force hand demonstrated the ability to withstand a total weight of up to 27.5 kg, grasp various objects ranging from simple to complex-shaped tools, and achieve a high success rate in both perching and takeoff.</p></details> |  |

Traditional model-based and data-driven techniques lack adaptability, while more flexible generative AI methods struggle with grounding extracted information to real-world constraints. We introduce RAIDER, a novel agent that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with grounded tools for adaptable and efficient issue detection and explanation. Using a unique "Ground, Ask& Answer, Issue" procedure, RAIDER dynamically generates context-aware precondition questions and selects appropriate tools for resolution, achieving targeted information gathering. Our results within a simulated household environment surpass methods relying on predefined models, full scene descriptions, or standalone trained models. Additionally, RAIDER's explanations enhance recovery success, including cases requiring human interaction. Its modular architecture, featuring self-correction mechanisms, enables straightforward adaptation to diverse scenarios, as demonstrated in a real-world human-assistive task. This showcases RAIDER's potential as a versatile agentic AI solution for robotic issue detection and explanation, while addressing the problem of grounding generative AI for its effective application in embodied agents.

| **[Transferable Latent-to-Latent Locomotion Policy for Efficient and Versatile Motion Control of Diverse Legged Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17626v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable capability in acquiring robot skills, but learning each new skill still requires substantial data collection for training. The pretrain-and-finetune paradigm offers a promising approach for efficiently adapting to new robot entities and tasks. Inspired by the idea that acquired knowledge can accelerate learning new tasks with the same robot and help a new robot master a trained task, we propose a latent training framework where a transferable latent-to-latent locomotion policy is pretrained alongside diverse task-specific observation encoders and action decoders. This policy in latent space processes encoded latent observations to generate latent actions to be decoded, with the potential to learn general abstract motion skills. To retain essential information for decision-making and control, we introduce a diffusion recovery module that minimizes information reconstruction loss during pretrain stage. During fine-tune stage, the pretrained latent-to-latent locomotion policy remains fixed, while only the lightweight task-specific encoder and decoder are optimized for efficient adaptation. Our method allows a robot to leverage its own prior experience across different tasks as well as the experience of other morphologically diverse robots to accelerate adaptation. We validate our approach through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating that the pretrained latent-to-latent locomotion policy effectively generalizes to new robot entities and tasks with improved efficiency.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a dynamic feature selection method based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning, combined with typical machine learning models, aimed at improving the classification accuracy of hazardous states under complex operating conditions. Firstly, this work innovatively employs a fiber rod-based MEMS attitude sensor to collect vibration data from the robot and extract high-dimensional feature vectors in both time and frequency domains. Then, a reinforcement learning model is used to dynamically select the optimal feature subset, reducing feature redundancy and enhancing classification accuracy. Finally, a CNN-LSTM deep learning model is employed for classification and recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the robot's ability to assess hazardous states across various operational scenarios, providing reliable technical support for robotic safety monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures, manuscript for Journal of Autonomous Robots</p></details> |
| **[Robot Character Generation and Adaptive Human-Robot Interaction with Personality Shaping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15518v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel framework for designing emotionally agile robots with dynamic personalities and memory-based learning, with the aim of performing adaptive and non-deterministic interactions with humans while conforming to shared social understanding. While existing work has largely focused on emotion recognition and static response systems, many approaches rely on sentiment analysis and action mapping frameworks that are pre-defined with limited dimensionality and fixed configurations, lacking the flexibility of dynamic personality traits and memory-enabled adaptation. Other systems are often restricted to limited modes of expression and fail to develop a causal relationship between human behavior and the robot's proactive physical actions, resulting in constrained adaptability and reduced responsiveness in complex, dynamic interactions. Our methodology integrates the Big Five Personality Traits, Appraisal Theory, and abstracted memory layers through Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates a parameterized robot personality based on the Big Five, processes human language and sentiments, evaluates human behavior using Appraisal Theory, and generates emotions and selects appropriate actions adapted by historical context over time. We validated the framework by testing three robots with distinct personalities in identical background contexts and found that personality, appraisal, and memory influence the adaptability of human-robot interactions. The impact of the individual components was further validated through ablation tests. We conclude that this system enables robots to engage in meaningful and personalized interactions with users, and holds significant potential for applications in domains such as pet robots, assistive robots, educational robots, and collaborative functional robots, where cultivating tailored relationships and enriching user experiences are essential.</p></details> |  |

These `microTac' tactile sensors are miniature versions of the TacTip vision-based tactile sensor, and can extract precise contact geometry and force information at each fingertip for use as feedback into a controller to modulate the grasp while a held object is manipulated. Using a parallel processing pipeline, we asynchronously capture tactile images and predict contact pose and force from multiple tactile sensors. Consistent pose and force models across all sensors are developed using supervised deep learning with transfer learning techniques. We then develop a grasp control framework that uses contact force feedback from all fingertip sensors simultaneously, allowing the hand to safely handle delicate objects even under external disturbances. This control framework is applied to several grasp-manipulation experiments: first, retaining a flexible cup in a grasp without crushing it under changes in object weight; second, a pouring task where the center of mass of the cup changes dynamically; and third, a tactile-driven leader-follower task where a human guides a held object. These manipulation tasks demonstrate more human-like dexterity with underactuated robotic hands by using fast reflexive control from tactile sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages. 10 figures.

In this work, we consider agents with a limited field of view, viewing range, and ability to miss objects within the viewing range (e.g., transparency). By considering the observation model independently from the motion policy, we can better predict the agent's behavior by considering these limitations and approximating them. We perform a user study where human operators navigate a cluttered scene while scanning the region for obstacles with a limited field of view and range. Using imitation learning, we show that a robot can adopt a human's strategy for observing an environment with limitations on observation and navigate with minimal collision with dynamic and static obstacles. We also show that this learned model helps it successfully navigate a physical hardware vehicle in real-time.</p></details> |  |

Existing works predominantly focus on attaining human-level manipulation skills for robotic hands, yet little attention has been paid to task planning on long-horizon timescales. With their outstanding in-context learning and zero-shot generation abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied and grounded in diverse robotic embodiments to facilitate task planning. However, LLMs still suffer from errors in long-horizon reasoning and from hallucinations in complex robotic tasks, lacking a guarantee of logical correctness when generating the plan. Previous works, such as LLM+P, extended LLMs with symbolic planners. However, none have been successfully applied to bimanual robots. New challenges inevitably arise in bimanual manipulation, necessitating not only effective task decomposition but also efficient task allocation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LLM+MAP, a bimanual planning framework that integrates LLM reasoning and multi-agent planning, automating effective and efficient bimanual task planning. We conduct simulated experiments on various long-horizon manipulation tasks of differing complexity. Our method is built using GPT-4o as the backend, and we compare its performance against plans generated directly by LLMs, including GPT-4o, V3 and also recent strong reasoning models o1 and R1. By analyzing metrics such as planning time, success rate, group debits, and planning-step reduction rate, we demonstrate the superior performance of LLM+MAP, while also providing insights into robotic reasoning.

| **[Discrete Policy: Learning Disentangled Action Space for Multi-Task Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18707v4)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning visuomotor policy for multi-task robotic manipulation has been a long-standing challenge for the robotics community. The difficulty lies in the diversity of action space: typically, a goal can be accomplished in multiple ways, resulting in a multimodal action distribution for a single task. The complexity of action distribution escalates as the number of tasks increases. In this work, we propose \textbf{Discrete Policy}, a robot learning method for training universal agents capable of multi-task manipulation skills. Discrete Policy employs vector quantization to map action sequences into a discrete latent space, facilitating the learning of task-specific codes. These codes are then reconstructed into the action space conditioned on observations and language instruction. We evaluate our method on both simulation and multiple real-world embodiments, including both single-arm and bimanual robot settings. We demonstrate that our proposed Discrete Policy outperforms a well-established Diffusion Policy baseline and many state-of-the-art approaches, including ACT, Octo, and OpenVLA. For example, in a real-world multi-task training setting with five tasks, Discrete Policy achieves an average success rate that is 26\% higher than Diffusion Policy and 15\% higher than OpenVLA. As the number of tasks increases to 12, the performance gap between Discrete Policy and Diffusion Policy widens to 32.5\%, further showcasing the advantages of our approach. Our work empirically demonstrates that learning multi-task policies within the latent space is a vital step toward achieving general-purpose agents.</p></details> | Accept to ICRA 2025 |

Teleoperation, leveraging a human in the loop, is a key step towards achieving more complex control strategies. Whilst teleoperation is widely used for rigid robots, for soft robots we require teleoperation methods where the configuration of the whole body is considered. We propose a method of using an identical 'physical twin', or demonstrator of the robot. This tendon robot can be back-driven, with the tendon lengths providing configuration perception, and enabling a direct mapping of tendon lengths for the execture. We demonstrate how this teleoperation across the entire configuration of the robot enables complex interactions with exploit the envrionment, such as squeezing into gaps. We also show how this method can generalize to robots which are a larger scale that the physical twin, and how, tuneability of the stiffness properties of the physical twin simplify its use.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies often struggle to simultaneously identify unexpected failures reactively after they occur and prevent foreseeable ones proactively. To this end, we propose Code-as-Monitor (CaM), a novel paradigm leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for both open-set reactive and proactive failure detection. The core of our method is to formulate both tasks as a unified set of spatio-temporal constraint satisfaction problems and use VLM-generated code to evaluate them for real-time monitoring. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring, we further introduce constraint elements that abstract constraint-related entities or their parts into compact geometric elements. This approach offers greater generality, simplifies tracking, and facilitates constraint-aware visual programming by leveraging these elements as visual prompts. Experiments show that CaM achieves a 28.7% higher success rate and reduces execution time by 31.8% under severe disturbances compared to baselines across three simulators and a real-world setting. Moreover, CaM can be integrated with open-loop control policies to form closed-loop systems, enabling long-horizon tasks in cluttered scenes with dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

Despite their potential, there is still limited understanding of how to effectively integrate psychophysiological methods to improve human-robot collaboration (HRC) in construction. This paper addresses this gap by critically reviewing the use of psychophysiological methods for HRC within construction environments, employing a concept-methodology-value philosophical framework. The analysis reveals that measuring brain activity using electroencephalography is the most widely used method, while most of the works are still at the proof of concept stage and lack empirical evidence. Three potential research directions were proposed: the integration of multi-modal psychophysiological signals, enriching the existing experimental settings for better generalizability, and leveraging advanced biocompatible or contactless technologies for effective signal detection. The findings should benefit subsequent exploration and practical applications of psychophysiological methods to enable better implementation of robots and support HRC in construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAPI: A Model for Learning Robot Facial Expressions from Human Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17046v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic robotic facial expression generation is crucial for human-robot interaction, as handcrafted methods based on fixed joint configurations often yield rigid and unnatural behaviors. Although recent automated techniques reduce the need for manual tuning, they tend to fall short by not adequately bridging the gap between human preferences and model predictions-resulting in a deficiency of nuanced and realistic expressions due to limited degrees of freedom and insufficient perceptual integration. In this work, we propose a novel learning-to-rank framework that leverages human feedback to address this discrepancy and enhanced the expressiveness of robotic faces. Specifically, we conduct pairwise comparison annotations to collect human preference data and develop the Human Affective Pairwise Impressions (HAPI) model, a Siamese RankNet-based approach that refines expression evaluation. Results obtained via Bayesian Optimization and online expression survey on a 35-DOF android platform demonstrate that our approach produces significantly more realistic and socially resonant expressions of Anger, Happiness, and Surprise than those generated by baseline and expert-designed methods. This confirms that our framework effectively bridges the gap between human preferences and model predictions while robustly aligning robotic expression generation with human affective responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavioral Conflict Avoidance Between Humans and Quadruped Robots in Shared Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17014v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, robots are increasingly operated in environments shared with humans, where conflicts between human and robot behaviors may compromise safety. This paper presents a proactive behavioral conflict avoidance framework based on the principle of adaptation to trends for quadruped robots that not only ensures the robot's safety but also minimizes interference with human activities. It can proactively avoid potential conflicts with approaching humans or other dynamic objects, whether the robot is stationary or in motion, then swiftly resume its tasks once the conflict subsides. An enhanced approach is proposed to achieve precise human detection and tracking on vibratory robot platform equipped with low-cost hybrid solid-state LiDAR. When potential conflict detected, the robot selects an avoidance point and executes an evasion maneuver before resuming its task. This approach contrasts with conventional methods that remain goal-driven, often resulting in aggressive behaviors, such as forcibly bypassing obstacles and causing conflicts or becoming stuck in deadlock scenarios. The selection of avoidance points is achieved by integrating static and dynamic obstacle to generate a potential field map. The robot then searches for feasible regions within this map and determines the optimal avoidance point using an evaluation function. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework significantly reduces interference with human activities, enhances the safety of both robots and persons.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Autonomous Exploration-Based Precise Mapping for Mobile Robots through Stepwise and Consistent Motions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17005v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an autonomous exploration framework. It is designed for indoor ground mobile robots that utilize laser Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), ensuring process completeness and precise mapping results. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on multiple Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. Traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. Adaptive sampling density adjustments, informed by obstacle distribution, enhance exploration coverage potential. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is adopted, wherein the robot strictly drives straight on approximately equidistant line segments in the polyline path and rotates in place at segment junctions. This simplified, decoupled motion pattern improves scan-matching stability and mitigates map drift. For process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillation caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is introduced to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency and precision. Experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness of the framework. It achieves improved mapping coverage and precision in more challenging environments compared to baseline 2D exploration algorithms. It also shows robustness in supporting resource-constrained robot platforms and maintaining mapping consistency across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures.

| **[Extending Behavior Trees for Robotic Missions with Quality Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16969v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context and motivation: In recent years, behavior trees have gained growing interest within the robotics community as a specification and control switching mechanism for the different tasks that form a robotics mission. Problem: Given the rising complexity and prevalence of robotic systems, it is increasingly challenging and important for practitioners to design high-quality missions that meet certain qualities, for instance, to consider potential failures or mitigate safety risks. In software requirements engineering, quality or non-functional requirements have long been recognized as a key factor in system success. Currently, qualities are not represented in behavior tree models, which capture a robotic mission, making it difficult to assess the extent to which different mission components comply with those qualities. Principal ideas: In this paper, we propose an extension for behavior trees to have qualities and quality requirements explicitly represented in robotics missions. We provide a meta-model for the extension, develop a domain-specific language (DSL), and describe how we integrated our DSL in one of the most used languages in robotics for developing behavior trees, BehaviorTree.CPP. A preliminary evaluation of the implemented DSL shows promising results for the feasibility of our approach and the need for similar DSLs. Contribution: Our approach paves the way for incorporating qualities into the behavior model of robotics missions. This promotes early expression of qualities in robotics missions, and a better overview of missions components and their contribution to the satisfaction of quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ) 2025</p></details> |

We report on an artistic-exploration of how dancers, working as part of a multidisciplinary team, engaged in contact improvisation exercises to explore the opportunities and challenges of dancing with cobots. We reveal how they employed their honed bodily senses and physical skills to engage with the robots aesthetically and yet safely, interleaving improvised physical manipulations with reflections to grow their knowledge of how the robots behaved and felt. We introduce somatic safety, a holistic mind-body approach in which safety is learned, felt and enacted through bodily contact with robots in addition to being reasoned about. We conclude that robots need to be better designed for people to hold them and might recognise tacit safety cues among people.We propose that safety should be learned through iterative bodily experience interleaved with reflection.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM/I...</summary><p>ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI'25)</p></details> |

In workplace settings, humans and robots may work together as colleagues, potentially leading to social expectations, or violation thereof. Extant research has primarily sought to understand social interactions and expectations in personal rather than professional settings, and none of these studies have examined negative outcomes arising from violations of social expectations. This paper reports the results of a 2x3 online experiment that used a unique first-person perspective video to immerse participants in a collaborative workplace setting. The results are nuanced and reveal that while robots are expected to act in accordance with social expectations despite human behavior, there are benefits for robots perceived as being the bigger person in the face of human rudeness. Theoretical and practical implications are provided which discuss the import of these findings for the design of social robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author version of the manuscript submitted to ACM Transactions on Human-Robot Interaction.

| **[A Unified Framework for Real-Time Failure Handling in Robotics Using Vision-Language Models, Reactive Planner and Behavior Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15202v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic systems often face execution failures due to unexpected obstacles, sensor errors, or environmental changes. Traditional failure recovery methods rely on predefined strategies or human intervention, making them less adaptable. This paper presents a unified failure recovery framework that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs), a reactive planner, and Behavior Trees (BTs) to enable real-time failure handling. Our approach includes pre-execution verification, which checks for potential failures before execution, and reactive failure handling, which detects and corrects failures during execution by verifying existing BT conditions, adding missing preconditions and, when necessary, generating new skills. The framework uses a scene graph for structured environmental perception and an execution history for continuous monitoring, enabling context-aware and adaptive failure handling. We evaluate our framework through real-world experiments with an ABB YuMi robot on tasks like peg insertion, object sorting, and drawer placement, as well as in AI2-THOR simulator. Compared to using pre-execution and reactive methods separately, our approach achieves higher task success rates and greater adaptability. Ablation studies highlight the importance of VLM-based reasoning, structured scene representation, and execution history tracking for effective failure recovery in robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incremental Learning for Robot Shared Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06315v3)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shared autonomy holds promise for improving the usability and accessibility of assistive robotic arms, but current methods often rely on costly expert demonstrations and remain static after pretraining, limiting their ability to handle real-world variations. Even with extensive training data, unforeseen challenges--especially those that fundamentally alter task dynamics, such as unexpected obstacles or spatial constraints--can cause assistive policies to break down, leading to ineffective or unreliable assistance. To address this, we propose ILSA, an Incrementally Learned Shared Autonomy framework that continuously refines its assistive policy through user interactions, adapting to real-world challenges beyond the scope of pre-collected data. At the core of ILSA is a structured fine-tuning mechanism that enables continual improvement with each interaction by effectively integrating limited new interaction data while preserving prior knowledge, ensuring a balance between adaptation and generalization. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates ILSA's effectiveness, showing faster task completion and improved user experience compared to static alternatives.

Doing so, bystanders maintained the robot's (sometimes incongruous) behaviour as relevant to the activity at hand and preserved the robot itself as a competent participant. Relying on these data, we argue that ex ante definitions of a robot as "social" (i.e. before any interaction occurred) run the risk of naturalizing as self-evident the observable result from micro-sociological processes: namely, the interactional work of co-present humans through which the robot's conduct is reconfigured as contextually relevant.</p></details> |  |

In domestic settings, aligning task planning with user reminders poses significant challenges due to the limited quantity, diversity, and multimodal nature of the reminders. To address these challenges, AlignBot employs a fine-tuned LLaVA-7B model, functioning as an adapter for GPT-4o. This adapter model internalizes diverse forms of user reminders-such as personalized preferences, corrective guidance, and contextual assistance-into structured instruction-formatted cues that prompt GPT-4o in generating customized task plans. Additionally, AlignBot integrates a dynamic retrieval mechanism that selects task-relevant historical successes as prompts for GPT-4o, further enhancing task planning accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of AlignBot, experiments are conducted in real-world household environments, which are constructed within the laboratory to replicate typical household settings. A multimodal dataset with over 1,500 entries derived from volunteer reminders is used for training and evaluation. The results demonstrate that AlignBot significantly improves customized task planning, outperforming existing LLM- and VLM-powered planners by interpreting and aligning with user reminders, achieving 86.8% success rate compared to the vanilla GPT-4o baseline at 21.6%, reflecting a 65% improvement and over four times greater effectiveness.

| **[An Integrated Approach to Robotic Object Grasping and Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13205v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In response to the growing challenges of manual labor and efficiency in warehouse operations, Amazon has embarked on a significant transformation by incorporating robotics to assist with various tasks. While a substantial number of robots have been successfully deployed for tasks such as item transportation within warehouses, the complex process of object picking from shelves remains a significant challenge. This project addresses the issue by developing an innovative robotic system capable of autonomously fulfilling a simulated order by efficiently selecting specific items from shelves. A distinguishing feature of the proposed robotic system is its capacity to navigate the challenge of uncertain object positions within each bin of the shelf. The system is engineered to autonomously adapt its approach, employing strategies that enable it to efficiently locate and retrieve the desired items, even in the absence of pre-established knowledge about their placements.</p></details> | <details><summary>I am ...</summary><p>I am making big changes in the paper and continuing its further development with other instituition</p></details> |

This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project released at: https://chenyi99.github.io/moto/ Code released at: https://github.com/TencentARC/Moto Update: Added content related to real-world robot experiments and learning from human videos; Modified author information</p></details> |

This letter focuses on in-grasp object movement, which refers to manipulating an object to a desired pose through only finger motions within a stable grasp. The key challenge lies in simultaneously achieving high precision and large-range movements while maintaining a constant stable grasp. To address this problem, we propose a simple and practical approach based on kinematic trajectory optimization with no need for pretraining or object geometries, which can be easily applied to novel objects in real-world scenarios. Adopting this approach, we won the championship for the in-hand manipulation track at the 9th Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition (RGMC) held at ICRA 2024. Implementation details, discussion, and further quantitative experimental results are presented in this letter, which aims to comprehensively evaluate our approach and share our key takeaways from the competition.

Traditional keypoint-based sparse tracking is limited by featured points, while flow-based dense two-view matching suffers from long-term drifts. Recently, the Tracking Any Point (TAP) algorithm was proposed to overcome these limitations and achieve dense accurate long-term tracking. However, its efficacy in surgical scenarios remains untested, largely due to the lack of a comprehensive surgical tracking dataset for evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce a new annotated surgical tracking dataset for benchmarking tracking methods for surgical scenarios, comprising real-world surgical videos with complex tissue and instrument motions. We extensively evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) TAP-based algorithms on this dataset and reveal their limitations in challenging surgical scenarios, including fast instrument motion, severe occlusions, and motion blur, etc. Furthermore, we propose a new tracking method, namely SurgMotion, to solve the challenges and further improve the tracking performance. Our proposed method outperforms most TAP-based algorithms in surgical instruments tracking, and especially demonstrates significant improvements over baselines in challenging medical videos. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zhanbh1019/SurgicalMotion.</p></details> | 7 pages |

This gap arises from factors like model inaccuracies, environmental variations, and unexpected disturbances. Similarly, model discrepancies caused by system degradation over time or minor changes in the system's configuration also hinder the effectiveness of the developed methodologies. Effectively closing these gaps is critical and remains an open challenge. This work proposes a lightweight conformal mapping framework to transfer control and planning policies from an expert teacher to a degraded less capable learner. The method leverages Schwarz-Christoffel Mapping (SCM) to geometrically map teacher control inputs into the learner's command space, ensuring maneuver consistency. To demonstrate its generality, the framework is applied to two representative types of control and planning methods in a path-tracking task: 1) a discretized motion primitives command transfer and 2) a continuous Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based command transfer. The proposed framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the sim-to-real gap by closely transferring teacher commands to the learner robot.</p></details> |  |

The study systematically assesses three state-of-the-art approaches, namely two differential pipelines and a data-driven approach. We also devise a novel physics-informed neural network approach for physics parameter estimation. These approaches are interfaced with two simulations across multiple Real-to-Sim scenarios (lifting, wind blowing, and stretching) for five different fabric types and evaluated on three unseen scenarios (folding, fling, and shaking). We found that the simulation engines and the choice of Real-to-Sim approaches significantly impact fabric manipulation performance in our evaluation scenarios. Moreover, PINN observes superior performance in quasi-static tasks but shows limitations in dynamic scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, the interplay between morphological and control complexities and their collective impact on task performance remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigate these trade-offs across tasks of differing difficulty levels using four well-used morphological complexity metrics and control complexity measured by FLOPs. We investigate how these factors jointly influence task performance by utilizing the evolutionary robot experiments. Results show that optimal performance depends on the alignment between morphology and control: simpler morphologies and lightweight controllers suffice for easier tasks, while harder tasks demand higher complexities in both dimensions. In addition, a clear trade-off between morphological and control complexities that achieve the same task performance can be observed. Moreover, we also propose a sensitivity analysis to expose the task-specific contributions of individual morphological metrics. Our study establishes a framework for investigating the relationships between morphology, control, and task performance, advancing the development of task-specific robotic designs that balance computational efficiency with adaptability. This study contributes to the practical application of soft robotics in real-world scenarios by providing actionable insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is planed to be submitted to a journal</p></details> |

Humans, on the other hand, can often rely on their knowledge and experience to fill in the gaps. For example, the simple task of organizing newly bought produce into the fridge involves deciding where to put each thing individually, how to arrange them together meaningfully, e.g. putting related things together, all while there is no clear right and wrong way to accomplish this task. We could encode all this information on how to do such things explicitly into the robots' knowledge base, but this can quickly become overwhelming, considering the number of potential tasks and circumstances the robot could encounter. However, images of the real world often implicitly encode answers to such questions and can show which configurations of objects are meaningful or are usually used by humans. An image of a full fridge can give a lot of information about how things are usually arranged in relation to each other and the full fridge at large. Modern generative systems are capable of generating plausible images of the real world and can be conditioned on the environment in which the robot operates. Here we investigate the idea of using the implicit knowledge about the world of modern generative AI systems given by their ability to generate convincing images of the real world to solve under-specified tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Wearable Haptics for a Marionette-inspired Teleoperation of Highly Redundant Robotic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15998v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The teleoperation of complex, kinematically redundant robots with loco-manipulation capabilities represents a challenge for human operators, who have to learn how to operate the many degrees of freedom of the robot to accomplish a desired task. In this context, developing an easy-to-learn and easy-to-use human-robot interface is paramount. Recent works introduced a novel teleoperation concept, which relies on a virtual physical interaction interface between the human operator and the remote robot equivalent to a "Marionette" control, but whose feedback was limited to only visual feedback on the human side. In this paper, we propose extending the "Marionette" interface by adding a wearable haptic interface to cope with the limitations given by the previous works. Leveraging the additional haptic feedback modality, the human operator gains full sensorimotor control over the robot, and the awareness about the robot's response and interactions with the environment is greatly improved. We evaluated the proposed interface and the related teleoperation framework with naive users, assessing the teleoperation performance and the user experience with and without haptic feedback. The conducted experiments consisted in a loco-manipulation mission with the CENTAURO robot, a hybrid leg-wheel quadruped with a humanoid dual-arm upper body.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A Laser-guided Interaction Interface for Providing Effective Robot Assistance to People with Upper Limbs Impairments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15987v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotics has shown significant potential in assisting people with disabilities to enhance their independence and involvement in daily activities. Indeed, a societal long-term impact is expected in home-care assistance with the deployment of intelligent robotic interfaces. This work presents a human-robot interface developed to help people with upper limbs impairments, such as those affected by stroke injuries, in activities of everyday life. The proposed interface leverages on a visual servoing guidance component, which utilizes an inexpensive but effective laser emitter device. By projecting the laser on a surface within the workspace of the robot, the user is able to guide the robotic manipulator to desired locations, to reach, grasp and manipulate objects. Considering the targeted users, the laser emitter is worn on the head, enabling to intuitively control the robot motions with head movements that point the laser in the environment, which projection is detected with a neural network based perception module. The interface implements two control modalities: the first allows the user to select specific locations directly, commanding the robot to reach those points; the second employs a paper keyboard with buttons that can be virtually pressed by pointing the laser at them. These buttons enable a more direct control of the Cartesian velocity of the end-effector and provides additional functionalities such as commanding the action of the gripper. The proposed interface is evaluated in a series of manipulation tasks involving a 6DOF assistive robot manipulator equipped with 1DOF beak-like gripper. The two interface modalities are combined to successfully accomplish tasks requiring bimanual capacity that is usually affected in people with upper limbs impairments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 12 figures |

We present a human-in-the-loop vision-based RL system that demonstrates impressive performance on a diverse set of dexterous manipulation tasks, including dynamic manipulation, precision assembly, and dual-arm coordination. Our approach integrates demonstrations and human corrections, efficient RL algorithms, and other system-level design choices to learn policies that achieve near-perfect success rates and fast cycle times within just 1 to 2.5 hours of training. We show that our method significantly outperforms imitation learning baselines and prior RL approaches, with an average 2x improvement in success rate and 1.8x faster execution. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating how it learns robust, adaptive policies for both reactive and predictive control strategies. Our results suggest that RL can indeed learn a wide range of complex vision-based manipulation policies directly in the real world within practical training times. We hope this work will inspire a new generation of learned robotic manipulation techniques, benefiting both industrial applications and research advancements.

However, despite these advances, robotic RL remains hard to use. It is acknowledged among practitioners that the particular implementation details of these algorithms are often just as important (if not more so) for performance as the choice of algorithm. We posit that a significant challenge to widespread adoption of robotic RL, as well as further development of robotic RL methods, is the comparative inaccessibility of such methods. To address this challenge, we developed a carefully implemented library containing a sample efficient off-policy deep RL method, together with methods for computing rewards and resetting the environment, a high-quality controller for a widely-adopted robot, and a number of challenging example tasks. We provide this library as a resource for the community, describe its design choices, and present experimental results. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that our implementation can achieve very efficient learning, acquiring policies for PCB board assembly, cable routing, and object relocation between 25 to 50 minutes of training per policy on average, improving over state-of-the-art results reported for similar tasks in the literature. These policies achieve perfect or near-perfect success rates, extreme robustness even under perturbations, and exhibit emergent recovery and correction behaviors. We hope that these promising results and our high-quality open-source implementation will provide a tool for the robotics community to facilitate further developments in robotic RL.

The algorithm uses a modified replay buffer inspired by the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) approach to artificially populate experience with successful trajectories, effectively addressing the problem of sparse reward scenarios and eliminating the need to manually collect expert demonstrations. The developed algorithm proposes a Transformer-based architecture to incorporate the context of previous states, allowing the agent to perform a deeper analysis and make decisions in a manner more akin to human learning. The effectiveness of the built-in replay buffer, which acts as an "internal demonstrator", is twofold: it accelerates learning and allows the algorithm to adapt to different tasks. Empirical data confirm the superiority of the algorithm by an average of 38.46% over other considered methods, and the most successful baseline by 28.21%, showing higher success rates and faster convergence in the point-reaching task. Since the control is performed through the robot's joints, the algorithm facilitates potential adaptation to a real robot system and construction of an obstacle avoidance task. Therefore, the algorithm has also been tested on tasks requiring following a complex dynamic trajectory and obstacle avoidance. The design of the algorithm ensures its applicability to a wide range of goal-oriented tasks, making it an easily integrated solution for real-world robotics applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

However, coordinating the tasks and motions of multiple robots is challenging due to issues, e.g. system uncertainty, task efficiency, algorithm scalability, and safety concerns. To address these challenges, this paper studies multi-robot coordination and proposes APEX-MR, an asynchronous planning and execution framework designed to safely and efficiently coordinate multiple robots to achieve cooperative assembly, e.g. LEGO assembly. In particular, APEX-MR provides a systematic approach to post-process multi-robot tasks and motion plans to enable robust asynchronous execution under uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that APEX-MR can significantly speed up the execution time of many long-horizon LEGO assembly tasks by 48% compared to sequential planning and 36% compared to synchronous planning on average. To further demonstrate the performance, we deploy APEX-MR to a dual-arm system to perform physical LEGO assembly. To our knowledge, this is the first robotic system capable of performing customized LEGO assembly using commercial LEGO bricks.

The cycloidal gear mechanism, with its inherent high torque density and mechanical robustness, offers significant advantages over conventional designs. By integrating cycloidal gears into the Quasi-Direct Drive framework, we aim to enhance the performance of legged robots, particularly in tasks demanding high torque and dynamic loads, while still keeping them lightweight. Additionally, we develop a torque estimation framework for the actuator using an Actuator Network, which effectively reduces the sim-to-real gap introduced by the cycloidal drive's complex dynamics. This integration is crucial for capturing the complex dynamics of a cycloidal drive, which contributes to improved learning efficiency, agility, and adaptability for reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceeding to 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA25)</p></details> |

Foundational models offer a transformative potential for child-robot interactions, enabling the design of personalized, engaging, and scalable interactions. However, their integration into educational contexts presents challenges in terms of ensuring age-appropriate and safe content and alignment with pedagogical goals. We introduce a hybrid approach to designing personalized educational dialogues in child-robot interactions.

We illustrate this approach through a project aimed at enhancing reading motivation, in which a robot facilitated book-related dialogues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Training Wheels: Adaptive Auxiliary Rewards for Robotics Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15724v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotics Reinforcement Learning (RL) often relies on carefully engineered auxiliary rewards to supplement sparse primary learning objectives to compensate for the lack of large-scale, real-world, trial-and-error data. While these auxiliary rewards accelerate learning, they require significant engineering effort, may introduce human biases, and cannot adapt to the robot's evolving capabilities during training. In this paper, we introduce Reward Training Wheels (RTW), a teacher-student framework that automates auxiliary reward adaptation for robotics RL. To be specific, the RTW teacher dynamically adjusts auxiliary reward weights based on the student's evolving capabilities to determine which auxiliary reward aspects require more or less emphasis to improve the primary objective. We demonstrate RTW on two challenging robot tasks: navigation in highly constrained spaces and off-road vehicle mobility on vertically challenging terrain. In simulation, RTW outperforms expert-designed rewards by 2.35% in navigation success rate and improves off-road mobility performance by 122.62%, while achieving 35% and 3X faster training efficiency, respectively. Physical robot experiments further validate RTW's effectiveness, achieving a perfect success rate (5/5 trials vs. 2/5 for expert-designed rewards) and improving vehicle stability with up to 47.4% reduction in orientation angles.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Safety Aware Task Planning via Large Language Models in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15707v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic task planning has unlocked better reasoning capabilities for complex, long-horizon workflows. However, ensuring safety in LLM-driven plans remains a critical challenge, as these models often prioritize task completion over risk mitigation. This paper introduces SAFER (Safety-Aware Framework for Execution in Robotics), a multi-LLM framework designed to embed safety awareness into robotic task planning. SAFER employs a Safety Agent that operates alongside the primary task planner, providing safety feedback. Additionally, we introduce LLM-as-a-Judge, a novel metric leveraging LLMs as evaluators to quantify safety violations within generated task plans. Our framework integrates safety feedback at multiple stages of execution, enabling real-time risk assessment, proactive error correction, and transparent safety evaluation. We also integrate a control framework using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to ensure safety guarantees within SAFER's task planning. We evaluated SAFER against state-of-the-art LLM planners on complex long-horizon tasks involving heterogeneous robotic agents, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing safety violations while maintaining task efficiency. We also verify the task planner and safety planner through actual hardware experiments involving multiple robots and a human.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capturing a Moving Target by Two Robots in the F2F Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15688v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a search problem on capturing a moving target on an infinite real line. Two autonomous mobile robots (which can move with a maximum speed of 1) are initially placed at the origin, while an oblivious moving target is initially placed at a distance $d$ away from the origin. The robots can move along the line in any direction, but the target is oblivious, cannot change direction, and moves either away from or toward the origin at a constant speed $v$. Our aim is to design efficient algorithms for the two robots to capture the target. The target is captured only when both robots are co-located with it. The robots communicate with each other only face-to-face (F2F), meaning they can exchange information only when co-located, while the target remains oblivious and has no communication capabilities. We design algorithms under various knowledge scenarios, which take into account the prior knowledge the robots have about the starting distance $d$, the direction of movement (either toward or away from the origin), and the speed $v$ of the target. As a measure of the efficiency of the algorithms, we use the competitive ratio, which is the ratio of the capture time of an algorithm with limited knowledge to the capture time in the full-knowledge model. In our analysis, we are mindful of the cost of changing direction of movement, and show how to accomplish the capture of the target with at most three direction changes (turns).</p></details> |  |
| **[Robotic Paper Wrapping by Learning Force Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15685v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic packaging using wrapping paper poses significant challenges due to the material's complex deformation properties. The packaging process itself involves multiple steps, primarily categorized as folding the paper or creating creases. Small deviations in the robot's arm trajectory or force vector can lead to tearing or wrinkling of the paper, exacerbated by the variability in material properties. This study introduces a novel framework that combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning to enable a robot to perform each step of the packaging process efficiently. The framework allows the robot to follow approximate trajectories of the tool-center point (TCP) based on human demonstrations while optimizing force control parameters to prevent tearing or wrinkling, even with variable wrapping paper materials. The proposed method was validated through ablation studies, which demonstrated successful task completion with a significant reduction in tear and wrinkle rates. Furthermore, the force control strategy proved to be adaptable across different wrapping paper materials and robust against variations in the size of the target object.</p></details> |  |
| **[Friction-Scaled Vibrotactile Feedback for Real-Time Slip Detection in Manipulation using Robotic Sixth Finger](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15447v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of extra-robotic limbs/fingers to enhance and expand motor skills, particularly for grasping and manipulation, possesses significant challenges. The grasping performance of existing limbs/fingers is far inferior to that of human hands. Human hands can detect onset of slip through tactile feedback originating from tactile receptors during the grasping process, enabling precise and automatic regulation of grip force. The frictional information is perceived by humans depending upon slip happening between finger and object. Enhancing this capability in extra-robotic limbs or fingers used by humans is challenging. To address this challenge, this paper introduces novel approach to communicate frictional information to users through encoded vibrotactile cues. These cues are conveyed on onset of incipient slip thus allowing users to perceive friction and ultimately use this information to increase force to avoid dropping of object. In a 2-alternative forced-choice protocol, participants gripped and lifted a glass under three different frictional conditions, applying a normal force of 3.5 N. After reaching this force, glass was gradually released to induce slip. During this slipping phase, vibrations scaled according to static coefficient of friction were presented to users, reflecting frictional conditions. The results suggested an accuracy of 94.53 p/m 3.05 (mean p/mSD) in perceiving frictional information upon lifting objects with varying friction. The results indicate effectiveness of using vibrotactile feedback for sensory feedback, allowing users of extra-robotic limbs or fingers to perceive frictional information. This enables them to assess surface properties and adjust grip force according to frictional conditions, enhancing their ability to grasp, manipulate objects more effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparative Study of Human Motion Models in Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Social Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15127v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social robot navigation is an evolving research field that aims to find efficient strategies to safely navigate dynamic environments populated by humans. A critical challenge in this domain is the accurate modeling of human motion, which directly impacts the design and evaluation of navigation algorithms. This paper presents a comparative study of two popular categories of human motion models used in social robot navigation, namely velocity-based models and force-based models. A system-theoretic representation of both model types is presented, which highlights their common feedback structure, although with different state variables. Several navigation policies based on reinforcement learning are trained and tested in various simulated environments involving pedestrian crowds modeled with these approaches. A comparative study is conducted to assess performance across multiple factors, including human motion model, navigation policy, scenario complexity and crowd density. The results highlight advantages and challenges of different approaches to modeling human behavior, as well as their role during training and testing of learning-based navigation policies. The findings offer valuable insights and guidelines for selecting appropriate human motion models when designing socially-aware robot navigation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-horizon Locomotion and Manipulation on a Quadrupedal Robot with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05291v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a large language model (LLM) based system to empower quadrupedal robots with problem-solving abilities for long-horizon tasks beyond short-term motions. Long-horizon tasks for quadrupeds are challenging since they require both a high-level understanding of the semantics of the problem for task planning and a broad range of locomotion and manipulation skills to interact with the environment. Our system builds a high-level reasoning layer with large language models, which generates hybrid discrete-continuous plans as robot code from task descriptions. It comprises multiple LLM agents: a semantic planner that sketches a plan, a parameter calculator that predicts arguments in the plan, a code generator that converts the plan into executable robot code, and a replanner that handles execution failures or human interventions. At the low level, we adopt reinforcement learning to train a set of motion planning and control skills to unleash the flexibility of quadrupeds for rich environment interactions. Our system is tested on long-horizon tasks that are infeasible to complete with one single skill. Simulation and real-world experiments show that it successfully figures out multi-step strategies and demonstrates non-trivial behaviors, including building tools or notifying a human for help. Demos are available on our project page: https://sites.google.com/view/long-horizon-robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[StyleLoco: Generative Adversarial Distillation for Natural Humanoid Robot Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15082v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots are anticipated to acquire a wide range of locomotion capabilities while ensuring natural movement across varying speeds and terrains. Existing methods encounter a fundamental dilemma in learning humanoid locomotion: reinforcement learning with handcrafted rewards can achieve agile locomotion but produces unnatural gaits, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) with motion capture data yields natural movements but suffers from unstable training processes and restricted agility. Integrating these approaches proves challenging due to the inherent heterogeneity between expert policies and human motion datasets. To address this, we introduce StyleLoco, a novel two-stage framework that bridges this gap through a Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD) process. Our framework begins by training a teacher policy using reinforcement learning to achieve agile and dynamic locomotion. It then employs a multi-discriminator architecture, where distinct discriminators concurrently extract skills from both the teacher policy and motion capture data. This approach effectively combines the agility of reinforcement learning with the natural fluidity of human-like movements while mitigating the instability issues commonly associated with adversarial training. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that StyleLoco enables humanoid robots to perform diverse locomotion tasks with the precision of expertly trained policies and the natural aesthetics of human motion, successfully transferring styles across different movement types while maintaining stable locomotion across a broad spectrum of command inputs.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Nevertheless, for an intuitive and fluent human-robot interaction, robots should be able to ground the conversation by relating ambiguous or underspecified spoken utterances to the current physical situation and to the intents expressed non verbally by the user, for example by using referential gaze. Here we propose a representation integrating speech and gaze to enable LLMs to obtain higher situated awareness and correctly resolve ambiguous requests. Our approach relies on a text-based semantic translation of the scanpath produced by the user along with the verbal requests and demonstrates LLM's capabilities to reason about gaze behavior, robustly ignoring spurious glances or irrelevant objects. We validate the system across multiple tasks and two scenarios, showing its generality and accuracy, and demonstrate its implementation on a robotic platform, closing the loop from request interpretation to execution.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis reveals that even state-of-the-art policy models frequently exhibit unstable grasping behaviors, leading to failure cases that create bottlenecks in real-world robotic applications. To address these challenges, we introduce GraspCorrect, a plug-and-play module designed to enhance grasp performance through vision-language model-guided feedback. GraspCorrect employs an iterative visual question-answering framework with two key components: grasp-guided prompting, which incorporates task-specific constraints, and object-aware sampling, which ensures the selection of physically feasible grasp candidates. By iteratively generating intermediate visual goals and translating them into joint-level actions, GraspCorrect significantly improves grasp stability and consistently enhances task success rates across existing policy models in the RLBench and CALVIN datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, a learning-based approach based on condensation of the FEM model is detailed. The proposed method handles several kinds of actuators and contacts with the environment. We demonstrate that this compact model can be learned as a unified model across several designs and remains very efficient in terms of modeling since we can deduce the direct and inverse kinematics of the robot. Building upon the intuition introduced in [11], the learned model is presented as a general framework for modeling, controlling, and designing soft manipulators. First, the method's adaptability and versatility are illustrated through optimization based control problems involving positioning and manipulation tasks with mechanical contact-based coupling. Secondly, the low memory consumption and the high prediction speed of the learned condensed model are leveraged for real-time embedding control without relying on costly online FEM simulation. Finally, the ability of the learned condensed FEM model to capture soft robot design variations and its differentiability are leveraged in calibration and design optimization applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Robotics, In press</p></details> |

This article focuses on proxemics, proposing a new taxonomy and suggesting future directions through an analysis of state-of-the-art studies and the identification of research gaps. The various factors that affect the dynamic properties of proxemics patterns in human-robot interaction are thoroughly explored. To establish a coherent proxemics framework, we identified and organized the key parameters and attributes that shape proxemics behavior. Building on this framework, we introduce a novel approach to define proxemics in robot navigation, emphasizing the significant attributes that influence its structure and size. This leads to the development of a new taxonomy that serves as a foundation for guiding future research and development. Our findings underscore the complexity of defining personal distance, revealing it as a complex, multi-dimensional challenge. Furthermore, we highlight the flexible and dynamic nature of personal zone boundaries, which should be adaptable to different contexts and circumstances. Additionally, we propose a new layer for implementing proxemics in the navigation of social robots.</p></details> |  |

Visual sensors like depth cameras enhance stability and robustness but face limitations, such as low operating frequencies relative to joint control and sensitivity to lighting, which hinder outdoor deployment. Additionally, deep neural networks in sensor and control systems increase computational demands. To address these issues, we introduce spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event cameras to perform a challenging quadruped parkour task. Event cameras capture dynamic visual data, while SNNs efficiently process spike sequences, mimicking biological perception. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms traditional models, achieving excellent parkour performance with just 11.7% of the energy consumption of an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model, yielding an 88.3% energy reduction. By integrating event cameras with SNNs, our work advances robotic reinforcement learning and opens new possibilities for applications in demanding environments.</p></details> |  |

However, developing low-cost solutions for their motion and planning problems remains a significant challenge in this field. This paper investigates the application of geometric iterative strategy methods to continuum robots, and proposes the algorithm based on an improved two-layer geometric iterative strategy for motion planning. First, we thoroughly study the kinematics and effective workspace of a multi-segment tendon-driven continuum robot with a floating base. Then, generalized iterative algorithms for solving arbitrary-segment continuum robots are proposed based on a series of problems such as initial arm shape dependence exhibited by similar methods when applied to continuum robots. Further, the task scenario is extended to a follow-the-leader task considering environmental factors, and further extended algorithm are proposed. Simulation comparison results with similar methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in eliminating the initial arm shape dependence and improving the solution efficiency and accuracy. The experimental results further demonstrate that the method based on improved two-layer geometric iteration can be used for motion planning task of a continuum robot with a floating base, under an average deviation of about 4 mm in the end position, an average orientation deviation of no more than 1 degree, and the reduction of average number of iterations and time cost is 127.4 iterations and 72.6 ms compared with similar methods, respectively.</p></details> | 32 pages, 16 figures |

This problem arises under obstructed visibility, where a robot cannot see another robot if there is a third robot on the straight line segment between the two robots. We assume that a robot's movement cannot be interrupted by an adversary and that robots have a small $O(1)$-sized memory that they can use to store information, but that cannot be communicated to the other robots. To solve this problem, we present an algorithm that works in three steps. First it establishes mutual visibility, then it elects one robot to be the leader, and finally it forms the required pattern. The whole algorithm runs in $O(n) + O(q \log n)$ rounds with probability at least $1 - n^{-q}$. The algorithms are collision-free and do not require the knowledge of the number of robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.14440</p></details> |

These robots take inspiration from biology: salps are gelatinous, jellyfish-like marine animals that utilize jet propulsion for maneuvering and can physically connect to form dynamic chains of arbitrary shape and size. The primary contributions of this research are twofold: first, we adapt a planar nonlinear multi-link snake robot model to model a planar multi-link salp-inspired system by removing joint actuators, introducing link thrusters, and allowing for non-uniform link lengths, masses, and moments of inertia. Second, we conduct a nonlinear observability analysis of the multi-link system with link thrusters, showing that the link angles, angular velocities, masses, and moments of inertia are locally observable when equipped with inertial measurement units and operating under specific thruster conditions. This research provides a theoretical foundation for modeling and estimating both the state and intrinsic parameters of a multi-link system with link thrusters, which are essential for effective controller design and performance.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 table |

Robotic assistance offers a promising solution by improving needle trajectory accuracy, reducing radiation exposure, and enabling real-time adjustments. In our previous work, we introduced a redundant robotic platform designed for dexterous needle insertion within the confined CT bore. However, its limited base mobility restricts flexible deployment in clinical settings. In this study, we present an improved 11-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic system that integrates a 6-DOF robotic base with a 5-DOF cable-driven end-effector, significantly enhancing workspace flexibility and precision. With the hyper-redundant degrees of freedom, we introduce a weighted inverse kinematics controller with a two-stage priority scheme for large-scale movement and fine in-bore adjustments, along with a null-space control strategy to optimize dexterity. We validate our system through both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating superior tracking accuracy and enhanced manipulability in CT-guided procedures.

Recent advancements in humanoid robots have shown great promise as a hardware platform for building generalist autonomy in the human world. A robot foundation model, trained on massive and diverse data sources, is essential for enabling the robots to reason about novel situations, robustly handle real-world variability, and rapidly learn new tasks. To this end, we introduce GR00T N1, an open foundation model for humanoid robots. GR00T N1 is a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a dual-system architecture.

Expert integrators must consider factors such as placement, payload, and robot reach requirements to determine the feasibility of automation. Ideally, such considerations are based on a detailed digital simulation developed before any hardware is deployed. However, this process is often time-consuming and challenging. To simplify these processes, we introduce a much simpler method for the feasibility analysis of robotic arms' reachability, designed for non-experts. We implement this method through a mobile, sensing-based prototype tool. The two-step experimental evaluation included the expert user study results, which helped us identify the difficulty levels of various deployment scenarios and refine the initial prototype. The results of the subsequent quantitative study with 22 non-expert participants utilizing both scenarios indicate that users could complete both simple and complex feasibility analyses in under ten minutes, exhibiting similar cognitive loads and high engagement. Overall, the results suggest that the tool was well-received and rated as highly usable, thereby showing a new path for changing the ease of feasibility analysis for automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE RA-L</p></details> |

Traditional marker-based methods often require human intervention for system setup. Furthermore, existing autonomous markerless calibration methods typically rely on pre-trained robot tracking models that impede their application on edge devices and require fine-tuning for novel robot embodiments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a model-based markerless camera-to-robot calibration framework, ARC-Calib, that is fully autonomous and generalizable across diverse robots and scenarios without requiring extensive data collection or learning. First, exploratory robot motions are introduced to generate easily trackable trajectory-based visual patterns in the camera's image frames. Then, a geometric optimization framework is proposed to exploit the coplanarity and collinearity constraints from the observed motions to iteratively refine the estimated calibration result. Our approach eliminates the need for extra effort in either environmental marker setup or data collection and model training, rendering it highly adaptable across a wide range of real-world autonomous systems. Extensive experiments are conducted in both simulation and the real world to validate its robustness and generalizability.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

This challenge is more significant for snake robots in ophthalmic surgery applications, such as the Improved Integrated Robotic Intraocular Snake (I$^2$RIS), given its small size and lack of embedded sensory feedback. Data-driven models take advantage of global function approximations, reducing complicated analytical models' challenge and computational costs. However, their performance might deteriorate in case of new data unseen in the training phase. Therefore, adding an adaptation mechanism might improve these models' performance during snake robots' interactions with unknown environments. In this work, we applied a model predictive path integral (MPPI) controller on a data-driven model of the I$^2$RIS based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and Gaussian mixture regression (GMR). To analyze the performance of the MPPI in unseen robot-tissue interaction situations, unknown external disturbances and environmental loads are simulated and added to the GMM-GMR model. These uncertainties of the robot model are then identified online using a radial basis function (RBF) whose weights are updated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Simulation results demonstrated the robustness of the optimal control solutions of the MPPI algorithm and its computational superiority over a conventional model predictive control (MPC) algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning-Based Neuroadaptive Control of Robotic Manipulators under Deferred Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14669v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based neuroadaptive control framework for robotic manipulators operating under deferred constraints. The proposed approach improves traditional barrier Lyapunov functions by introducing a smooth constraint enforcement mechanism that offers two key advantages: (i) it minimizes control effort in unconstrained regions and progressively increases it near constraints, improving energy efficiency, and (ii) it enables gradual constraint activation through a prescribed-time shifting function, allowing safe operation even when initial conditions violate constraints. To address system uncertainties and improve adaptability, an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework is employed. The critic network estimates the value function, while the actor network learns an optimal control policy in real time, enabling adaptive constraint handling without requiring explicit system modeling. Lyapunov-based stability analysis guarantees the boundedness of all closed-loop signals. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Safety-Critical and Distributed Nonlinear Predictive Controllers for Teams of Quadrupedal Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14656v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel hierarchical, safety-critical control framework that integrates distributed nonlinear model predictive controllers (DNMPCs) with control barrier functions (CBFs) to enable cooperative locomotion of multi-agent quadrupedal robots in complex environments. While NMPC-based methods are widely adopted for enforcing safety constraints and navigating multi-robot systems (MRSs) through intricate environments, ensuring the safety of MRSs requires a formal definition grounded in the concept of invariant sets. CBFs, typically implemented via quadratic programs (QPs) at the planning layer, provide formal safety guarantees. However, their zero-control horizon limits their effectiveness for extended trajectory planning in inherently unstable, underactuated, and nonlinear legged robot models. Furthermore, the integration of CBFs into real-time NMPC for sophisticated MRSs, such as quadrupedal robot teams, remains underexplored. This paper develops computationally efficient, distributed NMPC algorithms that incorporate CBF-based collision safety guarantees within a consensus protocol, enabling longer planning horizons for safe cooperative locomotion under disturbances and rough terrain conditions. The optimal trajectories generated by the DNMPCs are tracked using full-order, nonlinear whole-body controllers at the low level. The proposed approach is validated through extensive numerical simulations with up to four Unitree A1 robots and hardware experiments involving two A1 robots subjected to external pushes, rough terrain, and uncertain obstacle information. Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed CBF-based DNMPCs achieve a 27.89% higher success rate than conventional NMPCs without CBF constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Framework for Robots that Influence Humans over Long-Term Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14633v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot actions influence the decisions of nearby humans. Here influence refers to intentional change: robots influence humans when they shift the human's behavior in a way that helps the robot complete its task. Imagine an autonomous car trying to merge; by proactively nudging into the human's lane, the robot causes human drivers to yield and provide space. Influence is often necessary for seamless interaction. However, if influence is left unregulated and uncontrolled, robots will negatively impact the humans around them. Prior works have begun to address this problem by creating a variety of control algorithms that seek to influence humans. Although these methods are effective in the short-term, they fail to maintain influence over time as the human adapts to the robot's behaviors. In this paper we therefore present an optimization framework that enables robots to purposely regulate their influence over humans across both short-term and long-term interactions. Here the robot maintains its influence by reasoning over a dynamic human model which captures how the robot's current choices will impact the human's future behavior. Our resulting framework serves to unify current approaches: we demonstrate that state-of-the-art methods are simplifications of our underlying formalism. Our framework also provides a principled way to generate influential policies: in the best case the robot exactly solves our framework to find optimal, influential behavior. But when solving this optimization problem becomes impractical, designers can introduce their own simplifications to reach tractable approximations. We experimentally compare our unified framework to state-of-the-art baselines and ablations, and demonstrate across simulations and user studies that this framework is able to successfully influence humans over repeated interactions.

| **[Physically-Consistent Parameter Identification of Robots in Contact](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09850v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate inertial parameter identification is crucial for the simulation and control of robots encountering intermittent contact with the environment. Classically, robots' inertial parameters are obtained from CAD models that are not precise (and sometimes not available, e.g., Spot from Boston Dynamics), hence requiring identification. To do that, existing methods require access to contact force measurement, a modality not present in modern quadruped and humanoid robots. This paper presents an alternative technique that utilizes joint current/torque measurements -- a standard sensing modality in modern robots -- to identify inertial parameters without requiring direct contact force measurements. By projecting the whole-body dynamics into the null space of contact constraints, we eliminate the dependency on contact forces and reformulate the identification problem as a linear matrix inequality that can handle physical and geometrical constraints. We compare our proposed method against a common black-box identification method using a deep neural network and show that incorporating physical consistency significantly improves the sample efficiency and generalizability of the model. Finally, we validate our method on the Spot quadruped robot across various locomotion tasks, showcasing its accuracy and generalizability in real-world scenarios over different gaits.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Our approach reduces reliance on large-scale data and incorporates a robot-agnostic pipeline that embodies an LLM. Our framework, InteLiPlan, ensures that the LLM's decision-making capabilities are effectively aligned with robotic functions, enhancing operational robustness and adaptability, while our human-in-the-loop mechanism allows for real-time human intervention when user instruction is required. We evaluate our method in both simulation and on the real Toyota Human Support Robot (HSR). Our method achieves a 93% success rate in the 'fetch me' task completion with failure recovery, highlighting its capability in both failure reasoning and task planning. InteLiPlan achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art large-scale LLM-based robotics planners, while using only real-time onboard computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Chain-Driven, Sandwich-Legged Quadruped Robot: Design and Experimental Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14255v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a chain-driven, sandwich-legged, mid-size quadruped robot designed as an accessible research platform. The design prioritizes enhanced locomotion capabilities, improved reliability and safety of the actuation system, and simplified, cost-effective manufacturing processes. Locomotion performance is optimized through a sandwiched leg design and a dual-motor configuration, reducing leg inertia for agile movements. Reliability and safety are achieved by integrating robust cable strain reliefs, efficient heat sinks for motor thermal management, and mechanical limits to restrict leg motion. Simplified design considerations include a quasi-direct drive (QDD) actuator and the adoption of low-cost fabrication techniques, such as laser cutting and 3D printing, to minimize cost and ensure rapid prototyping. The robot weighs approximately 25 kg and is developed at a cost under \$8000, making it a scalable and affordable solution for robotics research. Experimental validations demonstrate the platform's capability to execute trot and crawl gaits on flat terrain and slopes, highlighting its potential as a versatile and reliable quadruped research platform.</p></details> | 6 pages, 9 figures |
| **[CTSAC: Curriculum-Based Transformer Soft Actor-Critic for Goal-Oriented Robot Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14254v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing demand for efficient and flexible robotic exploration solutions, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is becoming a promising approach in the field of autonomous robotic exploration. However, current RL-based exploration algorithms often face limited environmental reasoning capabilities, slow convergence rates, and substantial challenges in Sim-To-Real (S2R) transfer. To address these issues, we propose a Curriculum Learning-based Transformer Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (CTSAC) aimed at improving both exploration efficiency and transfer performance. To enhance the robot's reasoning ability, a Transformer is integrated into the perception network of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, leveraging historical information to improve the farsightedness of the strategy. A periodic review-based curriculum learning is proposed, which enhances training efficiency while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during curriculum transitions. Training is conducted on the ROS-Gazebo continuous robotic simulation platform, with LiDAR clustering optimization to further reduce the S2R gap. Experimental results demonstrate the CTSAC algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art non-learning and learning-based algorithms in terms of success rate and success rate-weighted exploration time. Moreover, real-world experiments validate the strong S2R transfer capabilities of CTSAC.</p></details> | <details><summary>7page...</summary><p>7pages,7 figures,Thesis received by 2025 ICRA</p></details> |

Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry, inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments. The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on collected legged robots and open-source datasets. To further promote research and development, the open-source datasets and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/NSN-Hello/GeoFlow-SLAM</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[CANVAS: Commonsense-Aware Navigation System for Intuitive Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01273v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-life robot navigation involves more than just reaching a destination; it requires optimizing movements while addressing scenario-specific goals. An intuitive way for humans to express these goals is through abstract cues like verbal commands or rough sketches. Such human guidance may lack details or be noisy. Nonetheless, we expect robots to navigate as intended. For robots to interpret and execute these abstract instructions in line with human expectations, they must share a common understanding of basic navigation concepts with humans. To this end, we introduce CANVAS, a novel framework that combines visual and linguistic instructions for commonsense-aware navigation. Its success is driven by imitation learning, enabling the robot to learn from human navigation behavior. We present COMMAND, a comprehensive dataset with human-annotated navigation results, spanning over 48 hours and 219 km, designed to train commonsense-aware navigation systems in simulated environments. Our experiments show that CANVAS outperforms the strong rule-based system ROS NavStack across all environments, demonstrating superior performance with noisy instructions. Notably, in the orchard environment, where ROS NavStack records a 0% total success rate, CANVAS achieves a total success rate of 67%. CANVAS also closely aligns with human demonstrations and commonsense constraints, even in unseen environments. Furthermore, real-world deployment of CANVAS showcases impressive Sim2Real transfer with a total success rate of 69%, highlighting the potential of learning from human demonstrations in simulated environments for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025, project page https://worv-ai.github.io/canvas</p></details> |
| **[db-CBS: Discontinuity-Bounded Conflict-Based Search for Multi-Robot Kinodynamic Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16445v4)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a multi-robot kinodynamic motion planner that enables a team of robots with different dynamics, actuation limits, and shapes to reach their goals in challenging environments. We solve this problem by combining Conflict-Based Search (CBS), a multi-agent path finding method, and discontinuity-bounded A*, a single-robot kinodynamic motion planner. Our method, db-CBS, operates in three levels. Initially, we compute trajectories for individual robots using a graph search that allows bounded discontinuities between precomputed motion primitives. The second level identifies inter-robot collisions and resolves them by imposing constraints on the first level. The third and final level uses the resulting solution with discontinuities as an initial guess for a joint space trajectory optimization. The procedure is repeated with a reduced discontinuity bound. Our approach is anytime, probabilistically complete, asymptotically optimal, and finds near-optimal solutions quickly. Experimental results with robot dynamics such as unicycle, double integrator, and car with trailer in different settings show that our method is capable of solving challenging tasks with a higher success rate and lower cost than the existing state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICRA 2024</p></details> |
| **[An Real-Sim-Real (RSR) Loop Framework for Generalizable Robotic Policy Transfer with Differentiable Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10118v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sim-to-real gap remains a critical challenge in robotics, hindering the deployment of algorithms trained in simulation to real-world systems. This paper introduces a novel Real-Sim-Real (RSR) loop framework leveraging differentiable simulation to address this gap by iteratively refining simulation parameters, aligning them with real-world conditions, and enabling robust and efficient policy transfer. A key contribution of our work is the design of an informative cost function that encourages the collection of diverse and representative real-world data, minimizing bias and maximizing the utility of each data point for simulation refinement. This cost function integrates seamlessly into existing reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC) and ensures a balanced exploration of critical regions in the real domain. Furthermore, our approach is implemented on the versatile Mujoco MJX platform, and our framework is compatible with a wide range of robotic systems. Experimental results on several robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the sim-to-real gap, achieving high task performance and generalizability across diverse scenarios of both explicit and implicit environmental uncertainties.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE(3)-Equivariant Robot Learning and Control: A Tutorial Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09829v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning and Transformers have driven major breakthroughs in robotics by employing techniques such as imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and LLM-based multimodal perception and decision-making. However, conventional deep learning and Transformer models often struggle to process data with inherent symmetries and invariances, typically relying on large datasets or extensive data augmentation. Equivariant neural networks overcome these limitations by explicitly integrating symmetry and invariance into their architectures, leading to improved efficiency and generalization. This tutorial survey reviews a wide range of equivariant deep learning and control methods for robotics, from classic to state-of-the-art, with a focus on SE(3)-equivariant models that leverage the natural 3D rotational and translational symmetries in visual robotic manipulation and control design. Using unified mathematical notation, we begin by reviewing key concepts from group theory, along with matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. We then introduce foundational group-equivariant neural network design and show how the group-equivariance can be obtained through their structure. Next, we discuss the applications of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks in robotics in terms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The SE(3)-equivariant control design is also reviewed from the perspective of geometric control. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of equivariant methods in developing more robust, sample-efficient, and multi-modal real-world robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Journcal of Control, Automation and Systems (IJCAS), Under Review</p></details> |

Inspired by the Mount Lyell salamander's ability to curl its body into a loop and effectively roll down {\Revision hill slopes}, in this study we develop a sand-rolling robot and investigate how its locomotion performance is governed by the shape of its body. We experimentally tested three different body shapes: Hexagon, Quadrilateral, and Triangle. We found that Hexagon and Triangle can achieve a faster rolling speed on sand, but exhibited more frequent failures of getting stuck. Analysis of the interaction between robot and sand revealed the failure mechanism: the deformation of the sand produced a local ``sand incline'' underneath robot contact segments, increasing the effective region of supporting polygon (ERSP) and preventing the robot from shifting its center of mass (CoM) outside the ERSP to produce sustainable rolling. Based on this mechanism, a highly-simplified model successfully captured the critical body pitch for each rolling shape to produce sustained rolling on sand, and informed design adaptations that mitigated the locomotion failures and improved robot speed by more than 200$\%$. Our results provide insights into how locomotors can utilize different morphological features to achieve robust rolling motion across deformable substrates.</p></details> |  |

| **[Robotic Compliant Object Prying Using Diffusion Policy Guided by Vision and Force Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03998v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of batteries in the electric vehicle industry and various consumer products has created an urgent need for effective recycling solutions. These products often contain a mix of compliant and rigid components, making robotic disassembly a critical step toward achieving scalable recycling processes. Diffusion policy has emerged as a promising approach for learning low-level skills in robotics. To effectively apply diffusion policy to contact-rich tasks, incorporating force as feedback is essential. In this paper, we apply diffusion policy with vision and force in a compliant object prying task. However, when combining low-dimensional contact force with high-dimensional image, the force information may be diluted. To address this issue, we propose a method that effectively integrates force with image data for diffusion policy observations. We validate our approach on a battery prying task that demands high precision and multi-step execution. Our model achieves a 96\% success rate in diverse scenarios, marking a 57\% improvement over the vision-only baseline. Our method also demonstrates zero-shot transfer capability to handle unseen objects and battery types.
