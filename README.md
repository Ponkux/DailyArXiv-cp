| **[ManipTrans: Efficient Dexterous Bimanual Manipulation Transfer via Residual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21860v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human hands play a central role in interacting, motivating increasing research in dexterous robotic manipulation. Data-driven embodied AI algorithms demand precise, large-scale, human-like manipulation sequences, which are challenging to obtain with conventional reinforcement learning or real-world teleoperation. To address this, we introduce ManipTrans, a novel two-stage method for efficiently transferring human bimanual skills to dexterous robotic hands in simulation. ManipTrans first pre-trains a generalist trajectory imitator to mimic hand motion, then fine-tunes a specific residual module under interaction constraints, enabling efficient learning and accurate execution of complex bimanual tasks. Experiments show that ManipTrans surpasses state-of-the-art methods in success rate, fidelity, and efficiency. Leveraging ManipTrans, we transfer multiple hand-object datasets to robotic hands, creating DexManipNet, a large-scale dataset featuring previously unexplored tasks like pen capping and bottle unscrewing. DexManipNet comprises 3.3K episodes of robotic manipulation and is easily extensible, facilitating further policy training for dexterous hands and enabling real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Graphs as World Models for Semantic Material-Aware Obstacle Handling in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21232v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to infer the material properties of obstacles limits their decision-making capacity. While AVs rely on sensor systems such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar to detect obstacles, this study suggests combining sensors with a knowledge graph (KG)-based world model to improve AVs' comprehension of physical material qualities. Beyond sensor data, AVs can infer qualities such as malleability, density, and elasticity using a semantic KG that depicts the relationships between obstacles and their attributes. Using the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, we evaluated AV performance with and without KG integration. The findings demonstrate that the KG-based method improves obstacle management, which allows AVs to use material qualities to make better decisions about when to change lanes or apply emergency braking. For example, the KG-integrated AV changed lanes for hard impediments like traffic cones and successfully avoided collisions with flexible items such as plastic bags by passing over them. Compared to the control system, the KG framework demonstrated improved responsiveness to obstacles by resolving conflicting sensor data, causing emergency stops for 13.3% more cases. In addition, our method exhibits a 6.6% higher success rate in lane-changing maneuvers in experimental scenarios, particularly for larger, high-impact obstacles. While we focus particularly on autonomous driving, our work demonstrates the potential of KG-based world models to improve decision-making in embodied AI systems and scale to other domains, including robotics, healthcare, and environmental simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Reasoning Video Segmentation with Just-in-Time Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21056v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning segmentation (RS) aims to identify and segment objects of interest based on implicit text queries. As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI agents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring explicit step-by-step guidance. However, current RS approaches rely heavily on the visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs), leading to several major limitations. First, they struggle with queries that require multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex spatial/temporal relationships. Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which may require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs and may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Finally, being primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they scale poorly to online video data. To address these limitations, we propose an agent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS without LLM fine-tuning. Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time digital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- a LLM plans the construction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using specialist vision models. We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin as "just-in-time" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific information and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating every specialist model. The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin representation to identify target objects. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new comprehensive video reasoning segmentation benchmark comprising 200 videos with 895 implicit text queries. The benchmark spans three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal) with three different reasoning chain complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[DINeMo: Learning Neural Mesh Models with no 3D Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20220v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-level 3D/6D pose estimation is a crucial step towards comprehensive 3D scene understanding, which would enable a broad range of applications in robotics and embodied AI. Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

| **[TokenHSI: Unified Synthesis of Physical Human-Scene Interactions through Task Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19901v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing diverse and physically plausible Human-Scene Interactions (HSI) is pivotal for both computer animation and embodied AI. Despite encouraging progress, current methods mainly focus on developing separate controllers, each specialized for a specific interaction task. This significantly hinders the ability to tackle a wide variety of challenging HSI tasks that require the integration of multiple skills, e.g., sitting down while carrying an object. To address this issue, we present TokenHSI, a single, unified transformer-based policy capable of multi-skill unification and flexible adaptation. The key insight is to model the humanoid proprioception as a separate shared token and combine it with distinct task tokens via a masking mechanism. Such a unified policy enables effective knowledge sharing across skills, thereby facilitating the multi-task training. Moreover, our policy architecture supports variable length inputs, enabling flexible adaptation of learned skills to new scenarios. By training additional task tokenizers, we can not only modify the geometries of interaction targets but also coordinate multiple skills to address complex tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve versatility, adaptability, and extensibility in various HSI tasks.

| **[DataPlatter: Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the DataPlatter method, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Body Discovery of Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19941v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the pursuit of realizing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the importance of embodied artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly apparent. Following this trend, research integrating robots with AGI has become prominent. As various kinds of embodiments have been designed, adaptability to diverse embodiments will become important to AGI. We introduce a new challenge, termed "Body Discovery of Embodied AI", focusing on tasks of recognizing embodiments and summarizing neural signal functionality. The challenge encompasses the precise definition of an AI body and the intricate task of identifying embodiments in dynamic environments, where conventional approaches often prove inadequate. To address these challenges, we apply causal inference method and evaluate it by developing a simulator tailored for testing algorithms with virtual environments. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical testing, demonstrating their robust performance in various scenarios based on virtual environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation and Understanding in Vision: A Survey and New Outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18016v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal technique in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling access to external, reliable, and up-to-date knowledge sources. In the context of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), RAG has proven invaluable by augmenting model outputs with supplementary, relevant information, thus improving their quality. Recently, the potential of RAG has extended beyond natural language processing, with emerging methods integrating retrieval-augmented strategies into the computer vision (CV) domain. These approaches aim to address the limitations of relying solely on internal model knowledge by incorporating authoritative external knowledge bases, thereby improving both the understanding and generation capabilities of vision models. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV, focusing on two main areas: (I) visual understanding and (II) visual generation. In the realm of visual understanding, we systematically review tasks ranging from basic image recognition to complex applications such as medical report generation and multimodal question answering. For visual content generation, we examine the application of RAG in tasks related to image, video, and 3D generation. Furthermore, we explore recent advancements in RAG for embodied AI, with a particular focus on applications in planning, task execution, multimodal perception, interaction, and specialized domains. Given that the integration of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV is still in its early stages, we also highlight the key limitations of current approaches and propose future research directions to drive the development of this promising area.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[NavCoT: Boosting LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation via Learning Disentangled Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07376v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and tailored 3D scene understanding designs. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZeroHSI: Zero-Shot 4D Human-Scene Interaction by Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18600v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-scene interaction (HSI) generation is crucial for applications in embodied AI, virtual reality, and robotics. Yet, existing methods cannot synthesize interactions in unseen environments such as in-the-wild scenes or reconstructed scenes, as they rely on paired 3D scenes and captured human motion data for training, which are unavailable for unseen environments. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis, eliminating the need for training on any MoCap data. Our key insight is to distill human-scene interactions from state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/ The first two authors contribute equally</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Training of Generalizable Visuomotor Policies via Control-Aware Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09258v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving generalization is one key challenge in embodied AI, where obtaining large-scale datasets across diverse scenarios is costly. Traditional weak augmentations, such as cropping and flipping, are insufficient for improving a model's performance in new environments. Existing data augmentation methods often disrupt task-relevant information in images, potentially degrading performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EAGLE, an efficient training framework for generalizable visuomotor policies that improves upon existing methods by (1) enhancing generalization by applying augmentation only to control-related regions identified through a self-supervised control-aware mask and (2) improving training stability and efficiency by distilling knowledge from an expert to a visuomotor student policy, which is then deployed to unseen environments without further fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on three domains, including the DMControl Generalization Benchmark, the enhanced Robot Manipulation Distraction Benchmark, and a long-sequential drawer-opening task, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[KARMA: Augmenting Embodied AI Agents with Long-and-short Term Memory Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14908v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI agents responsible for executing interconnected, long-sequence household tasks often face difficulties with in-context memory, leading to inefficiencies and errors in task execution. To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KARMA's plug-and-play capability allows for seamless deployment on real-world robotic systems, such as mobile manipulation platforms.Through this plug-and-play memory system, KARMA significantly enhances the ability of embodied agents to generate coherent and contextually appropriate plans, making the execution of complex household tasks more efficient.

| **[3D-GRAND: A Million-Scale Dataset for 3D-LLMs with Better Grounding and Less Hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05132v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of language and 3D perception is crucial for embodied agents and robots that comprehend and interact with the physical world. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities, their adaptation to 3D environments (3D-LLMs) remains in its early stages. A primary challenge is a lack of large-scale datasets with dense grounding between language and 3D scenes. We introduce 3D-GRAND, a pioneering large-scale dataset comprising 40,087 household scenes paired with 6.2 million densely-grounded scene-language instructions. Our results show that instruction tuning with 3D-GRAND significantly enhances grounding capabilities and reduces hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. As part of our contributions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark 3D-POPE to systematically evaluate hallucination in 3D-LLMs, enabling fair comparisons of models. Our experiments highlight a scaling effect between dataset size and 3D-LLM performance, emphasizing the importance of large-scale 3D-text datasets for embodied AI research. Our results demonstrate early signals for effective sim-to-real transfer, indicating that models trained on large synthetic data can perform well on real-world 3D scans. Through 3D-GRAND and 3D-POPE, we aim to equip the embodied AI community with resources and insights to lead to more reliable and better-grounded 3D-LLMs. Project website: https://3d-grand.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Towards Agentic AI Networking in 6G: A Generative Foundation Model-as-Agent Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15764v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The promising potential of AI and network convergence in improving networking performance and enabling new service capabilities has recently attracted significant interest. Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under revision at IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |
| **[Latent Action Learning Requires Supervision in the Presence of Distractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00379v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[SpatialBot: Precise Spatial Understanding with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13642v7)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in 2D image understanding, however they are still struggling with spatial understanding which is the foundation of Embodied AI. In this paper, we propose SpatialBot for better spatial understanding by feeding both RGB and depth images. Additionally, we have constructed the SpatialQA dataset, which involves multi-level depth-related questions to train VLMs for depth understanding. Finally, we present SpatialBench to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' capabilities in spatial understanding at different levels. Extensive experiments on our spatial-understanding benchmark, general VLM benchmarks and Embodied AI tasks, demonstrate the remarkable improvements of SpatialBot trained on SpatialQA.

| **[MoK-RAG: Mixture of Knowledge Paths Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Embodied AI Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13882v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While human cognition inherently retrieves information from diverse and specialized knowledge sources during decision-making processes, current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically operate through single-source knowledge retrieval, leading to a cognitive-algorithmic discrepancy. To bridge this gap, we introduce MoK-RAG, a novel multi-source RAG framework that implements a mixture of knowledge paths enhanced retrieval mechanism through functional partitioning of a large language model (LLM) corpus into distinct sections, enabling retrieval from multiple specialized knowledge paths. Applied to the generation of 3D simulated environments, our proposed MoK-RAG3D enhances this paradigm by partitioning 3D assets into distinct sections and organizing them based on a hierarchical knowledge tree structure. Different from previous methods that only use manual evaluation, we pioneered the introduction of automated evaluation methods for 3D scenes. Both automatic and human evaluations in our experiments demonstrate that MoK-RAG3D can assist Embodied AI agents in generating diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |

User study and quantitative evaluation demonstrate that our method can produce results that excel current state-of-the-art methods and are comparable to human-annotated datasets in both physics property and mesh quality. Furthermore, we show that our synthetic data can be used as training data for generative models, enabling next-step scaling up.

| **[Exploring 3D Activity Reasoning and Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D activity reasoning and planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advance in multimodal learning. However, most existing works share two constraints: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. To bridge the gaps, we propose 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans, and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[HIS-GPT: Towards 3D Human-In-Scene Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12955v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new task to benchmark human-in-scene understanding for embodied agents: Human-In-Scene Question Answering (HIS-QA). Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control.

| **[S2O: Static to Openable Enhancement for Articulated 3D Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18896v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite much progress in large 3D datasets there are currently few interactive 3D object datasets, and their scale is limited due to the manual effort required in their construction. We introduce the static to openable (S2O) task which creates interactive articulated 3D objects from static counterparts through openable part detection, motion prediction, and interior geometry completion. We formulate a unified framework to tackle this task, and curate a challenging dataset of openable 3D objects that serves as a test bed for systematic evaluation. Our experiments benchmark methods from prior work, extended and improved methods, and simple yet effective heuristics for the S2O task. We find that turning static 3D objects into interactively openable counterparts is possible but that all methods struggle to generalize to realistic settings of the task, and we highlight promising future work directions. Our work enables efficient creation of interactive 3D objects for robotic manipulation and embodied AI tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoMa-Kitchen: A 100K+ Benchmark for Affordance-Grounded Last-Mile Navigation in Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11081v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mobile manipulation, navigation and manipulation are often treated as separate problems, resulting in a significant gap between merely approaching an object and engaging with it effectively. Many navigation approaches primarily define success by proximity to the target, often overlooking the necessity for optimal positioning that facilitates subsequent manipulation. To address this, we introduce MoMa-Kitchen, a benchmark dataset comprising over 100k samples that provide training data for models to learn optimal final navigation positions for seamless transition to manipulation. Our dataset includes affordance-grounded floor labels collected from diverse kitchen environments, in which robotic mobile manipulators of different models attempt to grasp target objects amidst clutter. Using a fully automated pipeline, we simulate diverse real-world scenarios and generate affordance labels for optimal manipulation positions. Visual data are collected from RGB-D inputs captured by a first-person view camera mounted on the robotic arm, ensuring consistency in viewpoint during data collection. We also develop a lightweight baseline model, NavAff, for navigation affordance grounding that demonstrates promising performance on the MoMa-Kitchen benchmark. Our approach enables models to learn affordance-based final positioning that accommodates different arm types and platform heights, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable integration of navigation and manipulation in embodied AI.

| **[Making Every Frame Matter: Continuous Activity Recognition in Streaming Video via Adaptive Video Context Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14993v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video activity recognition has become increasingly important in robots and embodied AI. Recognizing continuous video activities poses considerable challenges due to the fast expansion of streaming video, which contains multi-scale and untrimmed activities. We introduce a novel system, CARS, to overcome these issues through adaptive video context modeling. Adaptive video context modeling refers to selectively maintaining activity-related features in temporal and spatial dimensions. CARS has two key designs. The first is an activity spatial feature extraction by eliminating irrelevant visual features while maintaining recognition accuracy. The second is an activity-aware state update introducing dynamic adaptability to better preserve the video context for multi-scale activity recognition. Our CARS runs at speeds $>$30 FPS on typical edge devices and outperforms all baselines by 1.2\% to 79.7\% in accuracy. Moreover, we explore applying CARS to a large video model as a video encoder. Experimental results show that our CARS can result in a 0.46-point enhancement (on a 5-point scale) on the in-distribution video activity dataset, and an improvement ranging from 1.19\% to 4\% on zero-shot video activity datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Long-horizon Embodied Planning with Implicit Logical Inference and Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15658v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon embodied planning underpins embodied AI. To accomplish long-horizon tasks, one of the most feasible ways is to decompose abstract instructions into a sequence of actionable steps. Foundation models still face logical errors and hallucinations in long-horizon planning, unless provided with highly relevant examples to the tasks. However, providing highly relevant examples for any random task is unpractical. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a novel framework for Real-time Long-horizon Embodied Planning. ReLEP can complete a wide range of long-horizon tasks without in-context examples by learning implicit logical inference through fine-tuning. The fine-tuned large vision-language model formulates plans as sequences of skill functions. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. When constructing the dataset, we considered the implicit logical relationships, enabling the model to learn implicit logical relationships and dispel hallucinations. Through comprehensive evaluations across various long-horizon tasks, ReLEP demonstrates high success rates and compliance to execution even on unseen tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

The high cost of commercial mobile manipulation robots significantly limits research in real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose AhaRobot, a low-cost and fully open-source dual-arm mobile manipulation robot system with a hardware cost of only $1,000 (excluding optional computational resources), which is less than 1/15 of the cost of popular mobile robots. The AhaRobot system consists of three components: (1) a novel low-cost hardware architecture primarily composed of off-the-shelf components, (2) an optimized control solution to enhance operational precision integrating dual-motor backlash control and static friction compensation, and (3) a simple remote teleoperation method RoboPilot. We use handles to control the dual arms and pedals for whole-body movement. The teleoperation process is low-burden and easy to operate, much like piloting. RoboPilot is designed for remote data collection in embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboPilot significantly enhances data collection efficiency in complex manipulation tasks, achieving a 30% increase compared to methods using 3D mouse and leader-follower systems. It also excels at completing extremely long-horizon tasks in one go. Furthermore, AhaRobot can be used to learn end-to-end policies and autonomously perform complex manipulation tasks, such as pen insertion and cleaning up the floor. We aim to build an affordable yet powerful platform to promote the development of embodied tasks on real devices, advancing more robust and reliable embodied AI.

Current screen based chat-bots do not take advantage of the the full-suite of natural inputs available in XR, including inward facing sensor data, instead they over-rely on explicit voice or text prompts, sometimes paired with multi-modal data dropped as part of the query. We propose a solution that leverages an attention framework that derives context implicitly from user actions, eye-gaze, and contextual memory within the XR environment. Our work minimizes the need for engineered explicit prompts, fostering grounded and intuitive interactions that glean user insights for the chat-bot.</p></details> |  |

The system leverages multiple RGBD cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Effectiveness of a Socratic Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning Method for Task Planning in Robotics, A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08174v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in reasoning with natural language. Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks. To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenFly: A Versatile Toolchain and Large-scale Benchmark for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents through an environment by leveraging both language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Interactive systems assist humans in these tasks, enabling applications in Embodied AI, human-robot interaction, and virtual reality. However, current methods in hand-object synthesis often neglect dynamics and focus on generating static grasps. The first part of this dissertation introduces dynamic grasp synthesis, where a hand grasps and moves an object to a target pose. We approach this task using physical simulation and reinforcement learning. We then extend this to bimanual manipulation and articulated objects, requiring fine-grained coordination between hands. In the second part of this dissertation, we study human-to-robot handovers. We integrate captured human motion into simulation and introduce a student-teacher framework that adapts to human behavior and transfers from sim to real. To overcome data scarcity, we generate synthetic interactions, increasing training diversity by 100x. Our user study finds no difference between policies trained on synthetic vs. real motions.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |

However, real-world datasets often lack sufficient data for training and evaluation, and synthetic datasets, while larger, lack acoustic realism. Consequently, neither effectively meets practical needs. To address this issue, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit based on the embodied AI simulation platform Habitat-sim, designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim supports multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level adjustments, enabling the creation of more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a benchmark dataset called SonicSet, utilizing LibriSpeech, Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K), Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to investigate the differences between synthetic and real-world data, we selected 5 hours of raw, non-reverberant data from the SonicSet validation set and recorded a real-world speech separation dataset, providing a reference for comparing SonicSet with other synthetic datasets. For speech enhancement, we utilized the real-world dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between SonicSet and existing synthetic datasets. The results indicate that models trained on SonicSet generalize better to real-world scenarios compared to other synthetic datasets.

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI.

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 11 figures, manuscript accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |

Affordance indicates where and how to grasp an object by taking its functionality into account, serving as the foundation for effective task-oriented grasping. However, current task-oriented methods often depend on extensive training data that is confined to specific tasks and objects, making it difficult to generalize to novel objects and complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce AffordGrasp, a novel open-vocabulary grasping framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) for in-context affordance reasoning. Unlike existing methods that rely on explicit task and object specifications, our approach infers tasks directly from implicit user instructions, enabling more intuitive and seamless human-robot interaction in everyday scenarios. Building on the reasoning outcomes, our framework identifies task-relevant objects and grounds their part-level affordances using a visual grounding module. This allows us to generate task-oriented grasp poses precisely within the affordance regions of the object, ensuring both functional and context-aware robotic manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. We believe our approach advances robotic manipulation techniques and contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://eqcy.github.io/affordgrasp/.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning.

Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of prior magical grasp implementations at a fraction of the GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |

These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction.

| **[MapNav: A Novel Memory Representation via Annotated Semantic Maps for VLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13451v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a key task in Embodied AI, requiring agents to navigate diverse and unseen environments while following natural language instructions. Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, when powered by open LLMs, they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a multicomponent memory system. In Minecraft experiments, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks where traditional Voyager fails without GPT-4, collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items and achieving $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones, advancing from basic wood tools to advanced iron equipment. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated collaborative experiences. MindForge advances the democratization of embodied AI development through open-ended social learning, enabling peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.</p></details> |  |

Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |

Recent advances in foundation models pave the way for generative agents capable of richer communication and adaptive problem-solving. This survey provides a systematic examination of how EMAS can benefit from these generative capabilities. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes EMAS by system architectures and embodiment modalities, emphasizing how collaboration spans both physical and virtual contexts. Central building blocks, perception, planning, communication, and feedback, are then analyzed to illustrate how generative techniques bolster system robustness and flexibility. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the transformative effects of integrating foundation models into embodied, multi-agent frameworks. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions, underlining the significant promise of EMAS to reshape the landscape of AI-driven collaboration.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We propose a novel object-centric latent action learning approach, based on VideoSaur and LAPO, that employs self-supervised decomposition of scenes into object representations and annotates video data with proxy-action labels. This method effectively disentangles causal agent-object interactions from irrelevant background noise and reduces the performance degradation of latent action learning approaches caused by distractors. Our preliminary experiments with the Distracting Control Suite show that latent action pretraining based on object decompositions improve the quality of inferred latent actions by x2.7 and efficiency of downstream fine-tuning with a small set of labeled actions, increasing return by x2.6 on average.</p></details> | Preprint.

However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

These advancements have led to an explosive increase in the demand for computational power, challenging the limits of Moore's Law. Optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing, faces significant challenges due to its high costs. To address this, various lithography simulators have been developed. However, many of these simulators are limited by their inadequate photoresist modeling capabilities. This paper presents TorchResist, an open-source, differentiable photoresist simulator.TorchResist employs an analytical approach to model the photoresist process, functioning as a white-box system with at most twenty interpretable parameters. Leveraging modern differentiable programming techniques and parallel computing on GPUs, TorchResist enables seamless co-optimization with other tools across multiple related tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that TorchResist achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing solutions.

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[LSceneLLM: Enhancing Large 3D Scene Understanding Using Adaptive Visual Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01292v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on 3D Vision-Language Models (3D-VLMs) is gaining increasing attention, which is crucial for developing embodied AI within 3D scenes, such as visual navigation and embodied question answering. Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |

Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code will be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |

This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions. This highlights the critical need for robust goal specification and safety frameworks before any physical implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected Version - Solved Some Issues with reference compilation by latex</p></details> |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

Nevertheless, the rapid development of MEANETs is accompanied by challenges in trustworthiness and operational efficiency. Fortunately, blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable characteristics, offers promising solutions for MEANETs. However, existing block propagation mechanisms suffer from challenges such as low propagation efficiency and weak security for block propagation, which results in delayed transmission of vehicular messages or vulnerability to malicious tampering, potentially causing severe traffic accidents in blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Moreover, current block propagation strategies cannot effectively adapt to real-time changes of dynamic topology in MEANETs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph Resfusion model-based trustworthy block propagation optimization framework for consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Specifically, we propose an innovative trust calculation mechanism based on the trust cloud model, which comprehensively accounts for randomness and fuzziness in the miner trust evaluation. Furthermore, by leveraging the strengths of graph neural networks and diffusion models, we develop a graph Resfusion model to effectively and adaptively generate the optimal block propagation trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other routing mechanisms in terms of block propagation efficiency and trustworthiness. Additionally, the results highlight its strong adaptability to dynamic environments, making it particularly suitable for rapidly changing MEANETs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices.

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

| **[Perception Matters: Enhancing Embodied AI with Uncertainty-Aware Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02297v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI has made significant progress acting in unexplored environments. However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior studies that explored this as long-form video understanding and utilized egocentric video only, we instead propose an LLM-based agent, Embodied VideoAgent, which constructs scene memory from both egocentric video and embodied sensory inputs (e.g. depth and pose sensing). We further introduce a VLM-based approach to automatically update the memory when actions or activities over objects are perceived. Embodied VideoAgent attains significant advantages over counterparts in challenging reasoning and planning tasks in 3D scenes, achieving gains of 4.9% on Ego4D-VQ3D, 5.8% on OpenEQA, and 11.7% on EnvQA. We have also demonstrated its potential in various embodied AI tasks including generating embodied interactions and perception for robot manipulation.

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |

The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment.

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV. Finally, we discuss several future research directions for advancing EAI-enabled LAE.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</p></details> |  |

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |

However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This study finds that state-of-the-art embodied AI agents compete for higher navigation quality, but often compromise the computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce "Skip-SCAR," an optimization framework that builds computationally and memory-efficient embodied AI agents to accomplish high-quality visual navigation tasks. Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint. Tested on the HM3D ObjectNav datasets and real-world physical hardware systems, Skip-SCAR not only minimizes hardware resources but also sets new performance benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of optimizing both navigation quality and computational efficiency for robotics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Privacy Risks in Reinforcement Learning for Household Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09273v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prominence of embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI), which empowers robots to navigate, perceive, and engage within virtual environments, has attracted significant attention, owing to the remarkable advances in computer vision and large language models. Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functionality understanding and segmentation in 3D scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16310v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model.

| **[Gaussian Object Carver: Object-Compositional Gaussian Splatting with surfaces completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02075v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene reconstruction is a foundational problem in computer vision. Despite recent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods often lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in scenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this paper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and scalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors and multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion (OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved surfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric fidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital twins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM-based planners are inefficient due to their large number of parameters and prone to inaccuracies because they operate in open-loop systems. We think the reason is that only applying LLMs as planners is insufficient. In this work, we propose DaDu-E, a robust closed-loop planning framework for embodied AI robots. Specifically, DaDu-E is equipped with a relatively lightweight LLM, a set of encapsulated robot skill instructions, a robust feedback system, and memory augmentation. Together, these components enable DaDu-E to (i) actively perceive and adapt to dynamic environments, (ii) optimize computational costs while maintaining high performance, and (iii) recover from execution failures using its memory and feedback mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world and simulated tasks show that DaDu-E achieves task success rates comparable to embodied AI robots with larger models as planners like COME-Robot, while reducing computational requirements by $6.6 \times$. Users are encouraged to explore our system at: \url{https://rlc-lab.github.io/dadu-e/}.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, submitted to JFR</p></details> |
| **[Holistic Understanding of 3D Scenes as Universal Scene Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01398v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene understanding is a long-standing challenge in computer vision and a key component in enabling mixed reality, wearable computing, and embodied AI. Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters, connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and easy integration with downstream tasks. We provide open access to our dataset, benchmark, and method's source code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Reward and Policy Jointly from Demonstration and Preference Improves Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06874v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for building contemporary foundation models and embodied AI. However, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning task. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant under-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward model and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment performance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated Human Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and demonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach admits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and leverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy Optimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment pipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with extensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially when the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.</p></details> |  |

The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EARBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EARDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downstream tasks. Image-to-video diffusion models are already capable of generating highly realistic synthetic videos. However, these models are not action-conditioned, and the most powerful models are closed-source which means they cannot be finetuned. In this work, we propose to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to action-conditioned world models, without access to the parameters of the pretrained model. Our approach, AVID, trains an adapter on a small domain-specific dataset of action-labelled videos. AVID uses a learned mask to modify the intermediate outputs of the pretrained model and generate accurate action-conditioned videos. We evaluate AVID on video game and real-world robotics data, and show that it outperforms existing baselines for diffusion model adaptation.1 Our results demonstrate that if utilized correctly, pretrained video models have the potential to be powerful tools for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/avid-world-model-adapters/home</p></details> |

In this study, we introduce ROOT, a VLM-based system designed to enhance the analysis of indoor scenes. Specifically, we first develop an iterative object perception algorithm using GPT-4V to detect object entities within indoor scenes. This is followed by employing vision foundation models to acquire additional meta-information about the scene, such as bounding boxes. Building on this foundational data, we propose a specialized VLM, SceneVLM, which is capable of generating spatial hierarchical scene graphs and providing distance information for objects within indoor environments. This information enhances our understanding of the spatial arrangement of indoor scenes. To train our SceneVLM, we collect over 610,000 images from various public indoor datasets and implement a scene data generation pipeline with a semi-automated technique to establish relationships and estimate distances among indoor objects. By utilizing this enriched data, we conduct various training recipes and finish SceneVLM. Our experiments demonstrate that \rootname facilitates indoor scene understanding and proves effective in diverse downstream applications, such as 3D scene generation and embodied AI. The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/harrytea/ROOT}.</p></details> |  |

The rapid advancement of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly broadened the scope of IQA, moving toward comprehensive image quality understanding that incorporates content analysis, degradation perception, and comparison reasoning beyond mere numerical scoring. Previous MLLM-based methods typically either generate numerical scores lacking interpretability or heavily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using large-scale annotated datasets to provide descriptive assessments, limiting their flexibility and applicability. In this paper, we propose Q-Insight, a reinforcement learning-based model built upon group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which demonstrates strong visual reasoning capability for image quality understanding while requiring only a limited amount of rating scores and degradation labels. By jointly optimizing score regression and degradation perception tasks with carefully designed reward functions, our approach effectively exploits their mutual benefits for enhanced performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Insight substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both score regression and degradation perception tasks, while exhibiting impressive zero-shot generalization to comparison reasoning tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/lwq20020127/Q-Insight.</p></details> | Technical report |

However, these methods require human intervention to adapt to real-world deployment challenges, such as model drift or unexpected performance degradation. We investigate whether reinforcement learning, specifically multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms, can dynamically manage model deployment decisions more effectively. Our approach enables more adaptive production environments by continuously evaluating deployed models and rolling back underperforming ones in real-time. We test six model selection strategies across two real-world datasets and find that RL based approaches match or exceed traditional methods in performance. Our findings suggest that reinforcement learning (RL)-based model management can improve automation, reduce reliance on manual interventions, and mitigate risks associated with post-deployment model failures.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCI-GRU: Stock Prediction Model Based on Multi-Head Cross-Attention and Improved GRU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20679v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As financial markets grow increasingly complex in the big data era, accurate stock prediction has become more critical. Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Mistaken Assumption of Interchangeable Deep Reinforcement Learning Implementations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22575v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a paradigm of artificial intelligence where an agent uses a neural network to learn which actions to take in a given environment. DRL has recently gained traction from being able to solve complex environments like driving simulators, 3D robotic control, and multiplayer-online-battle-arena video games. Numerous implementations of the state-of-the-art algorithms responsible for training these agents, like the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms, currently exist. However, studies make the mistake of assuming implementations of the same algorithm to be consistent and thus, interchangeable. In this paper, through a differential testing lens, we present the results of studying the extent of implementation inconsistencies, their effect on the implementations' performance, as well as their impact on the conclusions of prior studies under the assumption of interchangeable implementations. The outcomes of our differential tests showed significant discrepancies between the tested algorithm implementations, indicating that they are not interchangeable. In particular, out of the five PPO implementations tested on 56 games, three implementations achieved superhuman performance for 50% of their total trials while the other two implementations only achieved superhuman performance for less than 15% of their total trials. As part of a meticulous manual analysis of the implementations' source code, we analyzed implementation discrepancies and determined that code-level inconsistencies primarily caused these discrepancies. Lastly, we replicated a study and showed that this assumption of implementation interchangeability was sufficient to flip experiment outcomes. Therefore, this calls for a shift in how implementations are being used.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025)</p></details> |

Existing state-of-the-art algorithms, such as FACMAC, rely on global reward information, which may not accurately reflect the quality of individual robots' actions in decentralized systems. We integrate the concept of locality into critic learning, where strongly related robots form partitions during training. Robots within the same partition have a greater impact on each other, leading to more precise policy evaluation. Additionally, we construct a dependency graph to capture the relationships between robots, facilitating the partitioning process. This approach mitigates the curse of dimensionality and prevents robots from using irrelevant information. Our method improves existing algorithms by focusing on local rewards and leveraging partition-based learning to enhance training efficiency and performance. We evaluate the performance of Loc-FACMAC in three environments: Hallway, Multi-cartpole, and Bounded-Cooperative-Navigation. We explore the impact of partition sizes on the performance and compare the result with baseline MARL algorithms such as LOMAQ, FACMAC, and QMIX. The experiments reveal that, if the locality structure is defined properly, Loc-FACMAC outperforms these baseline algorithms up to 108\%, indicating that exploiting the locality structure in the actor-critic framework improves the MARL performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scenario Dreamer: Vectorized Latent Diffusion for Generating Driving Simulation Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22496v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Scenario Dreamer, a fully data-driven generative simulator for autonomous vehicle planning that generates both the initial traffic scene - comprising a lane graph and agent bounding boxes - and closed-loop agent behaviours. Existing methods for generating driving simulation environments encode the initial traffic scene as a rasterized image and, as such, require parameter-heavy networks that perform unnecessary computation due to many empty pixels in the rasterized scene. Moreover, we find that existing methods that employ rule-based agent behaviours lack diversity and realism. Scenario Dreamer instead employs a novel vectorized latent diffusion model for initial scene generation that directly operates on the vectorized scene elements and an autoregressive Transformer for data-driven agent behaviour simulation. Scenario Dreamer additionally supports scene extrapolation via diffusion inpainting, enabling the generation of unbounded simulation environments. Extensive experiments show that Scenario Dreamer outperforms existing generative simulators in realism and efficiency: the vectorized scene-generation base model achieves superior generation quality with around 2x fewer parameters, 6x lower generation latency, and 10x fewer GPU training hours compared to the strongest baseline. We confirm its practical utility by showing that reinforcement learning planning agents are more challenged in Scenario Dreamer environments than traditional non-generative simulation environments, especially on long and adversarial driving environments.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Hybrid Action Based Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Compatible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08096v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown excellent performance in solving decision-making and control problems of autonomous driving, which is increasingly applied in diverse driving scenarios. However, driving is a multi-attribute problem, leading to challenges in achieving multi-objective compatibility for current RL methods, especially in both policy execution and policy iteration. On the one hand, the common action space structure with single action type limits driving flexibility or results in large behavior fluctuations during policy execution. On the other hand, the multi-attribute weighted single reward function result in the agent's disproportionate attention to certain objectives during policy iterations. To this end, we propose a Multi-objective Ensemble-Critic reinforcement learning method with Hybrid Parametrized Action for multi-objective compatible autonomous driving. Specifically, a parameterized action space is constructed to generate hybrid driving actions, combining both abstract guidance and concrete control commands. A multi-objective critics architecture is constructed considering multiple attribute rewards, to ensure simultaneously focusing on different driving objectives. Additionally, uncertainty-based exploration strategy is introduced to help the agent faster approach viable driving policy. The experimental results in both the simulated traffic environment and the HighD dataset demonstrate that our method can achieve multi-objective compatible autonomous driving in terms of driving efficiency, action consistency, and safety. It enhances the general performance of the driving while significantly increasing training efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, reward hacking-a phenomenon where models exploit flaws in the reward model-remains a significant barrier to achieving robust and scalable intelligence through long-term training. Existing studies have proposed uncertain reward model to address reward hacking, however, they often lack systematic or theoretical foundations, failing to model the uncertainty intrinsically emerging from preference data. In this paper, we propose the Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model (PURM), a natural generalization of the classical Bradley-Terry reward model. PURM learns reward distributions directly from preference data and quantifies per-sample uncertainty via the average overlap area between reward distributions. To mitigate reward hacking, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware penalty into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which leverages the learned uncertainty to dynamically balance reward optimization and exploration. We propose a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of PURM. Experiments demonstrate that PURM significantly delays the onset of reward hacking while improving final reward performance, outperforming baseline methods in both stability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

While a single game or MDP may allow for several different discount factors, nondeterministic discounted-sum automata (NDAs) were only studied with respect to a single discount factor. It is known that every class of NDAs with an integer as the discount factor has good computational properties: It is closed under determinization and under the algebraic operations min, max, addition, and subtraction, and there are algorithms for its basic decision problems, such as automata equivalence and containment. Extending the integer discount factor to an arbitrary rational number, loses most of these good properties. We define and analyze nondeterministic discounted-sum automata in which each transition can have a different integral discount factor (integral NMDAs). We show that integral NMDAs with an arbitrary choice of discount factors are not closed under determinization and under algebraic operations and that their containment problem is undecidable. We then define and analyze a restricted class of integral NMDAs, which we call tidy NMDAs, in which the choice of discount factors depends on the prefix of the word read so far. Among their special cases are NMDAs that correlate discount factors to actions (alphabet letters) or to the elapsed time. We show that for every function $\theta$ that defines the choice of discount factors, the class of $\theta$-NMDAs enjoys all of the above good properties of NDAs with a single integral discount factor, as well as the same complexity of the required decision problems. Tidy NMDAs are also as expressive as deterministic integral NMDAs with an arbitrary choice of discount factors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Will ...</summary><p>Will be published in LMCS.

| **[Control of Humanoid Robots with Parallel Mechanisms using Kinematic Actuation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22459v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the mechanical design of Cassie, several recently released humanoid robots are using actuator configuration in which the motor is displaced from the joint location to optimize the leg inertia. This in turn induces a non linearity in the reduction ratio of the transmission which is often neglected when computing the robot motion (e.g. by trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning) and only accounted for at control time. This paper proposes an analytical method to efficiently handle this non-linearity. Using this actuation model, we demonstrate that we can leverage the dynamic abilities of the non-linear transmission while only modeling the inertia of the main serial chain of the leg, without approximating the motor capabilities nor the joint range. Based on analytical inverse kinematics, our method does not need any numerical routines dedicated to the closed-kinematics actuation, hence leading to very efficient computations. Our study focuses on two mechanisms widely used in recent humanoid robots; the four bar knee linkage as well as a parallel 2 DoF ankle mechanism. We integrate these models inside optimization based (DDP) and learning (PPO) control approaches. A comparison of our model against a simplified model that completely neglects closed chains is then shown in simulation.</p></details> |  |

EGSW integrates entropy regularization with advantage-based weighting to balance policy updates, enabling efficient exploration in high-dimensional state spaces. By employing temperature-scaled softmax weighting over sequences, EGSW prioritizing high-reward, high-uncertainty steps while maintaining training stability. Although originally developed to improve Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) during large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, EGSW is generalizable to other reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and can be implemented in both step-wise and trajectory-wise settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that EGSW enhances GRPO reasoning ability, yielding improvements in sample efficiency. Future work will explore the application of EGSW to advanced RL methodologies.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a reinforcement-learning framework for multi-setpoint and multi-trajectory tracking. Tracking multiple setpoints and time-varying trajectories in reinforcement learning is challenging due to the complexity of balancing multiple objectives, a difficulty further exacerbated by system uncertainties such as uncertain initial conditions and stochastic dynamics. This challenge is relevant, e.g., in bioprocesses involving microbial consortia, where precise control over population compositions is required. We introduce a novel return function based on multiplicative reciprocal saturation functions, which explicitly couples reward gains to the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple references. Through a case study involving light-mediated cybergenetic growth control in microbial consortia, we demonstrate via computational experiments that our approach achieves faster convergence, improved stability, and superior control compliance compared to conventional quadratic-cost-based return functions. Moreover, our method enables tuning of the saturation function's parameters, shaping the learning process and policy updates. By incorporating system uncertainties, our framework also demonstrates robustness, a key requirement in industrial bioprocessing. Overall, this work advances reinforcement-learning-based control strategies in bioprocess engineering, with implications in the broader field of process and systems engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified ODE Analysis of Smooth Q-Learning Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14442v3)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convergence of Q-learning has been the focus of extensive research over the past several decades. Recently, an asymptotic convergence analysis for Q-learning was introduced using a switching system framework. This approach applies the so-called ordinary differential equation (ODE) approach to prove the convergence of the asynchronous Q-learning modeled as a continuous-time switching system, where notions from switching system theory are used to prove its asymptotic stability without using explicit Lyapunov arguments. However, to prove stability, restrictive conditions, such as quasi-monotonicity, must be satisfied for the underlying switching systems, which makes it hard to easily generalize the analysis method to other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as the smooth Q-learning variants. In this paper, we present a more general and unified convergence analysis that improves upon the switching system approach and can analyze Q-learning and its smooth variants. The proposed analysis is motivated by previous work on the convergence of synchronous Q-learning based on $p$-norm serving as a Lyapunov function. However, the proposed analysis addresses more general ODE models that can cover both asynchronous Q-learning and its smooth versions with simpler frameworks.</p></details> |  |

While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been the predominant approach to enhance MLLM capabilities in task-specific optimization, it often falls short in fostering crucial generalized reasoning abilities. Although reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise in overcoming these limitations, it encounters two significant challenges: (1) its generalized capacities in multimodal tasks remain largely unexplored, and (2) its training constraints, including the constant Kullback-Leibler divergence or the clamp strategy, often result in suboptimal bottlenecks. To address these challenges, we propose OThink-MR1, an advanced MLLM equipped with profound comprehension and reasoning capabilities across multimodal tasks. Specifically, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization with a dynamic Kullback-Leibler strategy (GRPO-D), which markedly enhances reinforcement learning (RL) performance. For Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, GRPO-D achieves a relative improvement of more than 5.72% over SFT and more than 13.59% over GRPO in same-task evaluation on two adapted datasets. Furthermore, GRPO-D demonstrates remarkable cross-task generalization capabilities, with an average relative improvement of more than 61.63% over SFT in cross-task evaluation. These results highlight that the MLLM trained with GRPO-D on one multimodal task can be effectively transferred to another task, underscoring the superior generalized reasoning capabilities of our proposed OThink-MR1 model.</p></details> |  |

The transformer core is constituted by a ferromagnetic material, and accordingly, depending on the magnetization state, the energization of the transformer can lead to high magnetizing inrush currents. Such high amplitudes shorten the life expectancy of a transformer and cause power quality issues in power grids. Various techniques have been proposed to minimize the inrush current; however, the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for this challenge has not been investigated. RL incorporates the ability to learn inrush minimization strategies adjusted to the dynamic transformer operation environment. This study proposes an inrush current minimization framework by combining controlled switching with RL. Depending on the opening angle of the circuit breaker and the remanent fluxes at disconnection, the proposed method learns the optimal closing instant of the circuit breaker. Two RL algorithms have been trained and tested through an equivalent duality-based model of a real 7.4 MVA power transformer. The evaluation of the RL algorithms is carried out with real measurement data and compared with real laboratory inrush currents. The results show that the inrush current is effectively minimized with the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the main ways to control the whole body of humanoid robots. RL enables agents to complete tasks by learning from environment interactions, guided by task rewards. However, existing RL methods rarely explicitly consider the impact of body stability on humanoid locomotion and manipulation. Achieving high performance in whole-body control remains a challenge for RL methods that rely solely on task rewards. In this paper, we propose a Foundation model-based method for humanoid Locomotion And Manipulation (FLAM for short). FLAM integrates a stabilizing reward function with a basic policy. The stabilizing reward function is designed to encourage the robot to learn stable postures, thereby accelerating the learning process and facilitating task completion. Specifically, the robot pose is first mapped to the 3D virtual human model. Then, the human pose is stabilized and reconstructed through a human motion reconstruction model. Finally, the pose before and after reconstruction is used to compute the stabilizing reward. By combining this stabilizing reward with the task reward, FLAM effectively guides policy learning. Experimental results on a humanoid robot benchmark demonstrate that FLAM outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, highlighting its effectiveness in improving stability and overall performance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

We introduce SkillMimic, a unified data-driven framework that fundamentally changes how agents learn interaction skills by eliminating the need for skill-specific rewards. Our key insight is that a unified HOI imitation reward can effectively capture the essence of diverse interaction patterns from HOI datasets. This enables SkillMimic to learn a single policy that not only masters multiple interaction skills but also facilitates skill transitions, with both diversity and generalization improving as the HOI dataset grows. For evaluation, we collect and introduce two basketball datasets containing approximately 35 minutes of diverse basketball skills. Extensive experiments show that SkillMimic successfully masters a wide range of basketball skills including stylistic variations in dribbling, layup, and shooting. Moreover, these learned skills can be effectively composed by a high-level controller to accomplish complex and long-horizon tasks such as consecutive scoring, opening new possibilities for scalable and generalizable interaction skill learning.

However, despite their empirical successes, many SOTA policy gradient algorithms for discounted problems deviate from the theoretical policy gradient theorem due to the existence of a distribution mismatch. In this work, we analyze the impact of this mismatch on the policy gradient methods. Specifically, we first show that in the case of tabular parameterizations, the methods under the mismatch remain globally optimal. Then, we extend this analysis to more general parameterizations by leveraging the theory of biased stochastic gradient descent. Our findings offer new insights into the robustness of policy gradient methods as well as the gap between theoretical foundations and practical implementations.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art general and reasoning-focused LLMs across four complex financial reasoning tasks involving financial text, tabular data, and equations. We assess key capabilities such as numerical reasoning, tabular interpretation, financial terminology comprehension, long-context understanding, and equation-based problem solving. Our analysis reveals that while data quality and pretraining contribute to performance, general techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning offer limited gains in financial tasks. To address this, we propose two domain-adapted models, Fino1-8B and Fino1-14B, trained with CoT fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using domain-specific reasoning paths. Our models are trained on a carefully curated dataset integrating high-quality examples from diverse sources, covering financial reports, tables, equations, and structured XBRL texts. Despite limited training data, they achieve an 7-9% performance improvement, outperforming several advanced LLMs, including GPT-o1, GPT-o3-mini, GPT-4.5, and comparable with DeepSeek models (V3 and R1), demonstrating strong practical value in resource, constrained scenarios. Our findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptations in financial reasoning, and we release all datasets, models, and code for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, 3 Tables</p></details> |

While recent research has focused on algorithmic improvements, the importance of prompt-data construction has been overlooked. This paper addresses this gap by exploring data-driven bottlenecks in RLHF performance scaling, particularly reward hacking and decreasing response diversity. We introduce a hybrid reward system combining reasoning task verifiers (RTV) and a generative reward model (GenRM) to mitigate reward hacking. We also propose a novel prompt-selection method, Pre-PPO, to maintain response diversity and enhance learning effectiveness. Additionally, we find that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks early in RLHF training significantly improves performance. Experiments across two model sizes validate our methods' effectiveness and scalability. Results show that RTV is most resistant to reward hacking, followed by GenRM with ground truth, and then GenRM with SFT Best-of-N responses. Our strategies enable rapid capture of subtle task-specific distinctions, leading to substantial improvements in overall RLHF performance. This work highlights the importance of careful data construction and provides practical methods to overcome performance barriers in RLHF.</p></details> |  |

While previous methods have focused on minimizing or preventing OOD occurrences, they largely neglect recovery once an agent encounters such states. Although the latest research has attempted to address this by guiding agents back to in-distribution states, their reliance on uncertainty estimation hinders scalability in complex environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery (LaMOuR), which enables recovery learning without relying on uncertainty estimation. LaMOuR generates dense reward codes that guide the agent back to a state where it can successfully perform its original task, leveraging the capabilities of LVLMs in image description, logical reasoning, and code generation. Experimental results show that LaMOuR substantially enhances recovery efficiency across diverse locomotion tasks and even generalizes effectively to complex environments, including humanoid locomotion and mobile manipulation, where existing methods struggle.

In contrast, dogs and cats can adopt limping gaits when injured, demonstrating their remarkable ability to adapt to physical conditions. Inspired by such adaptability, this paper presents Action Learner (AcL), a novel teacher-student reinforcement learning framework that enables quadrupeds to autonomously adapt their gait for stable walking under multiple joint faults. Unlike conventional teacher-student approaches that enforce strict imitation, AcL leverages teacher policies to generate style rewards, guiding the student policy without requiring precise replication. We train multiple teacher policies, each corresponding to a different fault condition, and subsequently distill them into a single student policy with an encoder-decoder architecture. While prior works primarily address single-joint faults, AcL enables quadrupeds to walk with up to four faulty joints across one or two legs, autonomously switching between different limping gaits when faults occur. We validate AcL on a real Go2 quadruped robot under single- and double-joint faults, demonstrating fault-tolerant, stable walking, smooth gait transitions between normal and lamb gaits, and robustness against external disturbances.</p></details> |  |

However, many environments are incomplete or frequently change, making it difficult for standard centralized planning or pure reinforcement learning to maintain both global solution quality and local flexibility. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that integrates D* Lite global search with multi-agent reinforcement learning, using a switching mechanism and a freeze-prevention strategy to handle dynamic conditions and crowded settings. We evaluate the framework in the discrete POGEMA environment and compare it with baseline methods. Experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed framework substantially improves success rate, collision rate, and path efficiency. The model is further tested on the EyeSim platform, where it maintains feasible Pathfinding under frequent changes and large-scale robot deployments.</p></details> | 22 pages,7 figures |
| **[Sharpe Ratio-Guided Active Learning for Preference Optimization in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22137v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a cornerstone of the training and alignment pipeline for large language models (LLMs). Recent advances, such as direct preference optimization (DPO), have simplified the preference learning step. However, collecting preference data remains a challenging and costly process, often requiring expert annotation. This cost can be mitigated by carefully selecting the data points presented for annotation. In this work, we propose an active learning approach to efficiently select prompt and preference pairs using a risk assessment strategy based on the Sharpe Ratio. To address the challenge of unknown preferences prior to annotation, our method evaluates the gradients of all potential preference annotations to assess their impact on model updates. These gradient-based evaluations enable risk assessment of data points regardless of the annotation outcome. By leveraging the DPO loss derivations, we derive a closed-form expression for computing these Sharpe ratios on a per-tuple basis, ensuring our approach remains both tractable and computationally efficient. We also introduce two variants of our method, each making different assumptions about prior information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline by up to 5% in win rates against the chosen completion with limited human preference data across several language models and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, the substantial computational costs associated with RL-based approaches have led to growing interest in alternative paradigms, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of DPO in facilitating self-improvement for LLMs through iterative preference-based learning. We demonstrate that a single round of DPO with coarse filtering significantly enhances mathematical reasoning performance, particularly for strong base model. Furthermore, we design an iterative enhancement framework for both the generator and the reward model (RM), enabling their mutual improvement through online interaction across multiple rounds of DPO. Finally, with simple verifiable rewards, our model DPO-VP achieves RL-level performance with significantly lower computational overhead. These findings highlight DPO as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to RL, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM reasoning in resource-constrained situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bresa: Bio-inspired Reflexive Safe Reinforcement Learning for Contact-Rich Robotic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21989v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in reinforcement learning (RL)-based robotic systems is a critical challenge, especially in contact-rich tasks within unstructured environments. While the state-of-the-art safe RL approaches mitigate risks through safe exploration or high-level recovery mechanisms, they often overlook low-level execution safety, where reflexive responses to potential hazards are crucial. Similarly, variable impedance control (VIC) enhances safety by adjusting the robot's mechanical response, yet lacks a systematic way to adapt parameters, such as stiffness and damping throughout the task. In this paper, we propose Bresa, a Bio-inspired Reflexive Hierarchical Safe RL method inspired by biological reflexes. Our method decouples task learning from safety learning, incorporating a safety critic network that evaluates action risks and operates at a higher frequency than the task solver. Unlike existing recovery-based methods, our safety critic functions at a low-level control layer, allowing real-time intervention when unsafe conditions arise. The task-solving RL policy, running at a lower frequency, focuses on high-level planning (decision-making), while the safety critic ensures instantaneous safety corrections. We validate Bresa on multiple tasks including a contact-rich robotic task, demonstrating its reflexive ability to enhance safety, and adaptability in unforeseen dynamic environments. Our results show that Bresa outperforms the baseline, providing a robust and reflexive safety mechanism that bridges the gap between high-level planning and low-level execution.

A key prerequisite to developing these safeguards is understanding the ability of these AI assistants to mislead human teammates. We investigate this attack problem within the context of an intellective strategy game where a team of three humans and one AI assistant collaborate to answer a series of trivia questions. Unbeknownst to the humans, the AI assistant is adversarial. Leveraging techniques from Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL), the AI assistant learns a model of the humans' trust evolution and uses that model to manipulate the group decision-making process to harm the team. We evaluate two models -- one inspired by literature and the other data-driven -- and find that both can effectively harm the human team. Moreover, we find that in this setting our data-driven model is capable of accurately predicting how human agents appraise their teammates given limited information on prior interactions. Finally, we compare the performance of state-of-the-art LLM models to human agents on our influence allocation task to evaluate whether the LLMs allocate influence similarly to humans or if they are more robust to our attack. These results enhance our understanding of decision-making dynamics in small human-AI teams and lay the foundation for defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, accepted to ICLR 2025 Workshop on Human-AI Coevolution</p></details> |

While some methods incorporate previously learned skills, they usually rely on a fixed structure, such as a single Gaussian distribution, to define skill priors. This rigid assumption can restrict the diversity and flexibility of skills, particularly in complex, long-horizon tasks. In this work, we introduce a method that models potential primitive skill motions as having non-parametric properties with an unknown number of underlying features. We utilize a Bayesian non-parametric model, specifically Dirichlet Process Mixtures, enhanced with birth and merge heuristics, to pre-train a skill prior that effectively captures the diverse nature of skills. Additionally, the learned skills are explicitly trackable within the prior space, enhancing interpretability and control. By integrating this flexible skill prior into an RL framework, our approach surpasses existing methods in long-horizon manipulation tasks, enabling more efficient skill transfer and task success in complex environments. Our findings show that a richer, non-parametric representation of skill priors significantly improves both the learning and execution of challenging robotic tasks.

However, these methods often suffer from limited generalization, adaptability, and the lack of large-scale specialized datasets, unlike data-rich domains such as computer vision, making long-horizon task execution challenging. To address these gaps, we introduce DAHLIA, a data-agnostic framework for language-conditioned long-horizon robotic manipulation, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for real-time task planning and execution. DAHLIA employs a dual-tunnel architecture, where an LLM-powered planner collaborates with co-planners to decompose tasks and generate executable plans, while a reporter LLM provides closed-loop feedback, enabling adaptive re-planning and ensuring task recovery from potential failures. Moreover, DAHLIA integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) in task reasoning and temporal abstraction for efficient action execution, enhancing traceability and robustness. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse long-horizon tasks, achieving strong generalization in both simulated and real-world scenarios.

Detecting and mitigating dangerous faults on time is challenging due to the stochastic and unpredictable nature of fault occurrences, which can lead to limited diagnostic efficiency and compromise safety. This paper optimizes the safety and diagnostic performance of a real-world industrial Basic Drive Module(BDM) using Uppaal Stratego. We model the functional safety architecture of the BDM with timed automata and formally verify its key functional and safety requirements through model checking to eliminate unwanted behaviors. Considering the formally verified correct model as a baseline, we leverage the reinforcement learning facility in Uppaal Stratego to optimize the safe failure fraction to the 90 % threshold, improving fault detection ability.

The complexity of RL tasks requires meticulously designed reward functions that effectively drive learning while avoiding unintended consequences. Effective reward design aims to provide signals that accelerate the agent's convergence to optimal behavior. Crafting rewards that align with task objectives, foster desired behaviors, and prevent undesirable actions is inherently challenging. This thesis delves into the critical role of reward signals in RL, highlighting their impact on the agent's behavior and learning dynamics and addressing challenges such as delayed, ambiguous, or intricate rewards. In this thesis work, we tackle different aspects of reward shaping. First, we address the problem of designing informative and interpretable reward signals from a teacher's/expert's perspective (teacher-driven). Here, the expert, equipped with the optimal policy and the corresponding value function, designs reward signals that expedite the agent's convergence to optimal behavior. Second, we build on this teacher-driven approach by introducing a novel method for adaptive interpretable reward design. In this scenario, the expert tailors the rewards based on the learner's current policy, ensuring alignment and optimal progression. Third, we propose a meta-learning approach, enabling the agent to self-design its reward signals online without expert input (agent-driven). This self-driven method considers the agent's learning and exploration to establish a self-improving feedback loop.</p></details> | Doctoral thesis |

However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-COT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 35.8% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o.

Data-driven embodied AI algorithms demand precise, large-scale, human-like manipulation sequences, which are challenging to obtain with conventional reinforcement learning or real-world teleoperation. To address this, we introduce ManipTrans, a novel two-stage method for efficiently transferring human bimanual skills to dexterous robotic hands in simulation. ManipTrans first pre-trains a generalist trajectory imitator to mimic hand motion, then fine-tunes a specific residual module under interaction constraints, enabling efficient learning and accurate execution of complex bimanual tasks. Experiments show that ManipTrans surpasses state-of-the-art methods in success rate, fidelity, and efficiency. Leveraging ManipTrans, we transfer multiple hand-object datasets to robotic hands, creating DexManipNet, a large-scale dataset featuring previously unexplored tasks like pen capping and bottle unscrewing. DexManipNet comprises 3.3K episodes of robotic manipulation and is easily extensible, facilitating further policy training for dexterous hands and enabling real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

While recent works equip reinforcement learning (RL)-based LRMs with retrieval capabilities, they suffer from overthinking and lack robustness in reasoning, reducing their effectiveness in question answering (QA) tasks. To address this, we propose ReaRAG, a factuality-enhanced reasoning model that explores diverse queries without excessive iterations. Our solution includes a novel data construction framework with an upper bound on the reasoning chain length. Specifically, we first leverage an LRM to generate deliberate thinking, then select an action from a predefined action space (Search and Finish). For Search action, a query is executed against the RAG engine, where the result is returned as observation to guide reasoning steps later. This process iterates until a Finish action is chosen. Benefiting from ReaRAG's strong reasoning capabilities, our approach outperforms existing baselines on multi-hop QA. Further analysis highlights its strong reflective ability to recognize errors and refine its reasoning trajectory. Our study enhances LRMs' factuality while effectively integrating robust reasoning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).</p></details> |  |
| **[Collab: Controlled Decoding using Mixture of Agents for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21720v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment of Large Language models (LLMs) is crucial for safe and trustworthy deployment in applications. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an effective technique to align LLMs to human preferences and broader utilities, but it requires updating billions of model parameters, which is computationally expensive. Controlled Decoding, by contrast, provides a mechanism for aligning a model at inference time without retraining. However, single-agent decoding approaches often struggle to adapt to diverse tasks due to the complexity and variability inherent in these tasks. To strengthen the test-time performance w.r.t the target task, we propose a mixture of agent-based decoding strategies leveraging the existing off-the-shelf aligned LLM policies. Treating each prior policy as an agent in the spirit of mixture of agent collaboration, we develop a decoding method that allows for inference-time alignment through a token-level selection strategy among multiple agents. For each token, the most suitable LLM is dynamically chosen from a pool of models based on a long-term utility metric. This policy-switching mechanism ensures optimal model selection at each step, enabling efficient collaboration and alignment among LLMs during decoding. Theoretical analysis of our proposed algorithm establishes optimal performance with respect to the target task represented via a target reward for the given off-the-shelf models. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations with open-source aligned models on diverse tasks and preferences, which demonstrates the merits of this approach over single-agent decoding baselines. Notably, Collab surpasses the current SoTA decoding strategy, achieving an improvement of up to 1.56x in average reward and 71.89% in GPT-4 based win-tie rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

These models have found applications in education, intelligent decision-making, and gaming. However, effectively utilizing LLMs for strategic planning and decision-making in the game of Gomoku remains a challenge. This study aims to develop a Gomoku AI system based on LLMs, simulating the human learning process of playing chess. The system is de-signed to understand and apply Gomoku strat-egies and logic to make rational decisions. The research methods include enabling the model to "read the board," "understand the rules," "select strategies," and "evaluate positions," while en-hancing its abilities through self-play and rein-forcement learning. The results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the se-lection of move positions, resolves the issue of generating illegal positions, and reduces pro-cess time through parallel position evaluation. After extensive self-play training, the model's Gomoku-playing capabilities have been notably enhanced.</p></details> |  |
| **[A tale of two goals: leveraging sequentiality in multi-goal scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21677v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several hierarchical reinforcement learning methods leverage planning to create a graph or sequences of intermediate goals, guiding a lower-level goal-conditioned (GC) policy to reach some final goals. The low-level policy is typically conditioned on the current goal, with the aim of reaching it as quickly as possible. However, this approach can fail when an intermediate goal can be reached in multiple ways, some of which may make it impossible to continue toward subsequent goals. To address this issue, we introduce two instances of Markov Decision Process (MDP) where the optimization objective favors policies that not only reach the current goal but also subsequent ones. In the first, the agent is conditioned on both the current and final goals, while in the second, it is conditioned on the next two goals in the sequence. We conduct a series of experiments on navigation and pole-balancing tasks in which sequences of intermediate goals are given. By evaluating policies trained with TD3+HER on both the standard GC-MDP and our proposed MDPs, we show that, in most cases, conditioning on the next two goals improves stability and sample efficiency over other approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

To this end, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. We also introduce a unified rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data-efficient model, UI-R1-3B, achieves substantial improvements on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks. Specifically, on the ID benchmark AndroidControl, the action type accuracy improves by 15%, while grounding accuracy increases by 10.3%, compared with the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B). On the OOD GUI grounding benchmark ScreenSpot-Pro, our model surpasses the base model by 6.0% and achieves competitive performance with larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B), which are trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K data.

| **[Debiased Offline Representation Learning for Fast Online Adaptation in Non-stationary Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11317v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing policies that can adjust to non-stationary environments is essential for real-world reinforcement learning applications. However, learning such adaptable policies in offline settings, with only a limited set of pre-collected trajectories, presents significant challenges. A key difficulty arises because the limited offline data makes it hard for the context encoder to differentiate between changes in the environment dynamics and shifts in the behavior policy, often leading to context misassociations. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach called Debiased Offline Representation for fast online Adaptation (DORA). DORA incorporates an information bottleneck principle that maximizes mutual information between the dynamics encoding and the environmental data, while minimizing mutual information between the dynamics encoding and the actions of the behavior policy. We present a practical implementation of DORA, leveraging tractable bounds of the information bottleneck principle. Our experimental evaluation across six benchmark MuJoCo tasks with variable parameters demonstrates that DORA not only achieves a more precise dynamics encoding but also significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of performance.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing research focuses on task assignment at the current moment, overlooking the fluctuating demand and supply between tasks and workers over time. To address this issue, we introduce an adaptive task assignment problem, which aims to maximize the number of assigned tasks by dynamically adjusting task assignments in response to changing demand and supply. We develop a spatial crowdsourcing framework, namely demand-based adaptive task assignment with dynamic worker availability windows, which consists of two components including task demand prediction and task assignment. In the first component, we construct a graph adjacency matrix representing the demand dependency relationships in different regions and employ a multivariate time series learning approach to predict future task demands. In the task assignment component, we adjust tasks to workers based on these predictions, worker availability windows, and the current task assignments, where each worker has an availability window that indicates the time periods they are available for task assignments. To reduce the search space of task assignments and be efficient, we propose a worker dependency separation approach based on graph partition and a task value function with reinforcement learning. Experiments on real data demonstrate that our proposals are both effective and efficient.</p></details> |  |

Drones offer a scalable and cost-effective alternative to fixed sensor networks. However, deploying fleets of low-cost drones for traffic monitoring poses challenges in adaptability, scalability, and real-time operation. To address these issues, we propose a learning-based framework for decentralized traffic monitoring with drone swarms, targeting the uneven and unpredictable distribution of monitoring needs across urban areas. Our approach introduces a semi-decentralized reinforcement learning model, which trains a single Q-function using the collective experience of the swarm. This model supports full scalability, flexible deployment, and, when hardware allows, the online adaptation of each drone's action-selection mechanism. We first train and evaluate the model in a synthetic traffic environment, followed by a case study using real traffic data from Shenzhen, China, to validate its performance and demonstrate its potential for real-world applications in complex urban monitoring tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper accepted for presentation at the 23rd IEEE European Control Conference (ECC 2025), Thessaloniki, Greece</p></details> |
| **[Controlling Large Language Model with Latent Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21383v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks using Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be an effective approach. However, LLMs do not inherently define the structure of an agent for RL training, particularly in terms of defining the action space. This paper studies learning a compact latent action space to enhance the controllability and exploration of RL for LLMs. We propose Controlling Large Language Models with Latent Actions (CoLA), a framework that integrates a latent action space into pre-trained LLMs. We apply CoLA to the Llama-3.1-8B model. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to RL with token-level actions, CoLA's latent action enables greater semantic diversity in text generation. For enhancing downstream tasks, we show that CoLA with RL achieves a score of 42.4 on the math500 benchmark, surpassing the baseline score of 38.2, and reaches 68.2 when augmented with a Monte Carlo Tree Search variant. Furthermore, CoLA with RL consistently improves performance on agent-based tasks without degrading the pre-trained LLM's capabilities, unlike the baseline. Finally, CoLA reduces computation time by half in tasks involving enhanced thinking prompts for LLMs by RL. These results highlight CoLA's potential to advance RL-based adaptation of LLMs for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving: Improving Safety When Driving through Intersection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19690v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applying reinforcement learning to autonomous driving has garnered widespread attention. However, classical reinforcement learning methods optimize policies by maximizing expected rewards but lack sufficient safety considerations, often putting agents in hazardous situations. This paper proposes a risk-aware reinforcement learning approach for autonomous driving to improve the safety performance when crossing the intersection. Safe critics are constructed to evaluate driving risk and work in conjunction with the reward critic to update the actor. Based on this, a Lagrangian relaxation method and cyclic gradient iteration are combined to project actions into a feasible safe region. Furthermore, a Multi-hop and Multi-layer perception (MLP) mixed Attention Mechanism (MMAM) is incorporated into the actor-critic network, enabling the policy to adapt to dynamic traffic and overcome permutation sensitivity challenges. This allows the policy to focus more effectively on surrounding potential risks while enhancing the identification of passing opportunities. Simulation tests are conducted on different tasks at unsignalized intersections. The results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces collision rates and improves crossing efficiency in comparison to baseline algorithms. Additionally, our ablation experiments demonstrate the benefits of incorporating risk-awareness and MMAM into RL.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

A reasoning model is a relatively new type of generative model built on top of large language models (LLMs). A reasoning model generates a long chain of thought before arriving at a final answer, an approach found to improve performance on complex tasks. However, details on developing such a model are limited, especially for reasoning models that can generate traces in a low-resource language. Typhoon T1 presents an open effort that dives into the details of developing a reasoning model in a more cost-effective way by leveraging supervised fine-tuning using open datasets, instead of reinforcement learning. This paper shares the details about synthetic data generation and training, as well as our dataset and model weights. Additionally, we provide insights gained from developing a reasoning model that generalizes across domains and is capable of generating reasoning traces in a low-resource language, using Thai as an example. We hope this open effort provides a foundation for further research in this field.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Flip Learning: Weakly Supervised Erase to Segment Nodules in Breast Ultrasound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20685v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate segmentation of nodules in both 2D breast ultrasound (BUS) and 3D automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Therefore, developing an automated system for nodule segmentation can enhance user independence and expedite clinical analysis. Unlike fully-supervised learning, weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) can streamline the laborious and intricate annotation process. However, current WSS methods face challenges in achieving precise nodule segmentation, as many of them depend on inaccurate activation maps or inefficient pseudo-mask generation algorithms. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning-based WSS framework called Flip Learning, which relies solely on 2D/3D boxes for accurate segmentation. Specifically, multiple agents are employed to erase the target from the box to facilitate classification tag flipping, with the erased region serving as the predicted segmentation mask. The key contributions of this research are as follows: (1) Adoption of a superpixel/supervoxel-based approach to encode the standardized environment, capturing boundary priors and expediting the learning process. (2) Introduction of three meticulously designed rewards, comprising a classification score reward and two intensity distribution rewards, to steer the agents' erasing process precisely, thereby avoiding both under- and over-segmentation. (3) Implementation of a progressive curriculum learning strategy to enable agents to interact with the environment in a progressively challenging manner, thereby enhancing learning efficiency. Extensively validated on the large in-house BUS and ABUS datasets, our Flip Learning method outperforms state-of-the-art WSS methods and foundation models, and achieves comparable performance as fully-supervised learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Medical Image Analysis. 24 pages, 13 figures, 20 tabels</p></details> |

However, integrating reasoning with external search processes remains challenging, especially for complex multi-hop questions requiring multiple retrieval steps. We propose ReSearch, a novel framework that trains LLMs to Reason with Search via reinforcement learning without using any supervised data on reasoning steps. Our approach treats search operations as integral components of the reasoning chain, where when and how to perform searches is guided by text-based thinking, and search results subsequently influence further reasoning. We train ReSearch on Qwen2.5-7B(-Instruct) and Qwen2.5-32B(-Instruct) models and conduct extensive experiments. Despite being trained on only one dataset, our models demonstrate strong generalizability across various benchmarks. Analysis reveals that ReSearch naturally elicits advanced reasoning capabilities such as reflection and self-correction during the reinforcement learning process.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Reinforced Lifelong Editing for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05759v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) acquire information from pre-training corpora, but their stored knowledge can become inaccurate or outdated over time. Model editing addresses this challenge by modifying model parameters without retraining, and prevalent approaches leverage hypernetworks to generate these parameter updates. However, they face significant challenges in lifelong editing due to their incompatibility with LLM parameters that dynamically change during the editing process. To address this, we observed that hypernetwork-based lifelong editing aligns with reinforcement learning modeling and proposed RLEdit, an RL-based editing method. By treating editing losses as rewards and optimizing hypernetwork parameters at the full knowledge sequence level, we enable it to precisely capture LLM changes and generate appropriate parameter updates. Our extensive empirical evaluation across several LLMs demonstrates that RLEdit outperforms existing methods in lifelong editing with superior effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a 59.24% improvement while requiring only 2.11% of the time compared to most approaches.

Existing methods improve VLM reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning, using meticulously annotated training data to enhance visual reasoning capabilities. However, this training paradigm may lead to overfitting and cognitive rigidity, restricting the model's ability to transfer visual reasoning skills across domains and limiting its real-world applicability. To address these limitations, we propose Reason-RFT, a novel reinforcement fine-tuning framework that significantly enhances generalization capabilities in visual reasoning tasks. Reason-RFT introduces a two-phase training framework for visual reasoning: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with curated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data activates the reasoning potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), followed by (2) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based reinforcement learning that generates multiple reasoning-response pairs, significantly enhancing generalization in visual reasoning tasks. To evaluate Reason-RFT's visual reasoning capabilities, we reconstructed a comprehensive dataset spanning visual counting, structure perception, and spatial transformation. Experimental results demonstrate Reasoning-RFT's three key advantages: (1) Performance Enhancement: achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple tasks, outperforming most mainstream open-source and proprietary models; (2) Generalization Superiority: consistently maintaining robust performance across diverse tasks and domains, outperforming alternative training paradigms; (3) Data Efficiency: excelling in few-shot learning scenarios while surpassing full-dataset SFT baselines.

| **[Towards Better Alignment: Training Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning Against Sparse Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11240v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation. However, their practical applications are hindered by the misalignment between generated images and corresponding text prompts. To tackle this issue, reinforcement learning (RL) has been considered for diffusion model fine-tuning. Yet, RL's effectiveness is limited by the challenge of sparse reward, where feedback is only available at the end of the generation process. This makes it difficult to identify which actions during the denoising process contribute positively to the final generated image, potentially leading to ineffective or unnecessary denoising policies. To this end, this paper presents a novel RL-based framework that addresses the sparse reward problem when training diffusion models. Our framework, named $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$, employs two strategies: \textbf{B}ackward progressive training and \textbf{B}ranch-based sampling. For one thing, backward progressive training focuses initially on the final timesteps of denoising process and gradually extends the training interval to earlier timesteps, easing the learning difficulty from sparse rewards. For another, we perform branch-based sampling for each training interval. By comparing the samples within the same branch, we can identify how much the policies of the current training interval contribute to the final image, which helps to learn effective policies instead of unnecessary ones. $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$ is compatible with existing optimization algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$ in improving prompt-image alignment and maintaining diversity in generated images.

Although recent advancements have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate refactoring tasks, current solutions are constrained in scope and lack mechanisms to guarantee code compilability and successful test execution. In this work, we introduce MANTRA, a comprehensive LLM agent-based framework that automates method-level refactoring. MANTRA integrates Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation, coordinated Multi-Agent Collaboration, and Verbal Reinforcement Learning to emulate human decision-making during refactoring while preserving code correctness and readability. Our empirical study, conducted on 703 instances of "pure refactorings" (i.e., code changes exclusively involving structural improvements), drawn from 10 representative Java projects, covers the six most prevalent refactoring operations. Experimental results demonstrate that MANTRA substantially surpasses a baseline LLM model (RawGPT ), achieving an 82.8% success rate (582/703) in producing code that compiles and passes all tests, compared to just 8.7% (61/703) with RawGPT. Moreover, in comparison to IntelliJ's LLM-powered refactoring tool (EM-Assist), MANTRA exhibits a 50% improvement in generating Extract Method transformations. A usability study involving 37 professional developers further shows that refactorings performed by MANTRA are perceived to be as readable and reusable as human-written code, and in certain cases, even more favorable. These results highlight the practical advantages of MANTRA and emphasize the growing potential of LLM-based systems in advancing the automation of software refactoring tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[World Model Agents with Change-Based Intrinsic Motivation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21047v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse reward environments pose a significant challenge for reinforcement learning due to the scarcity of feedback. Intrinsic motivation and transfer learning have emerged as promising strategies to address this issue. Change Based Exploration Transfer (CBET), a technique that combines these two approaches for model-free algorithms, has shown potential in addressing sparse feedback but its effectiveness with modern algorithms remains understudied. This paper provides an adaptation of CBET for world model algorithms like DreamerV3 and compares the performance of DreamerV3 and IMPALA agents, both with and without CBET, in the sparse reward environments of Crafter and Minigrid. Our tabula rasa results highlight the possibility of CBET improving DreamerV3's returns in Crafter but the algorithm attains a suboptimal policy in Minigrid with CBET further reducing returns. In the same vein, our transfer learning experiments show that pre-training DreamerV3 with intrinsic rewards does not immediately lead to a policy that maximizes extrinsic rewards in Minigrid. Overall, our results suggest that CBET provides a positive impact on DreamerV3 in more complex environments like Crafter but may be detrimental in environments like Minigrid. In the latter case, the behaviours promoted by CBET in DreamerV3 may not align with the task objectives of the environment, leading to reduced returns and suboptimal policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Northern Lights Deep Learning Conference 2025</p></details> |

Rethinking Process Supervision from a Theoretical Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10581v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models have evolved, it has become crucial to distinguish between process supervision and outcome supervision -- two key reinforcement learning approaches to complex reasoning tasks. While process supervision offers intuitive advantages for long-term credit assignment, the precise relationship between these paradigms has remained an open question. Conventional wisdom suggests that outcome supervision is fundamentally more challenging due to the trajectory-level coverage problem, leading to significant investment in collecting fine-grained process supervision data. In this paper, we take steps towards resolving this debate. Our main theorem shows that, under standard data coverage assumptions, reinforcement learning through outcome supervision is no more statistically difficult than through process supervision, up to polynomial factors in horizon. At the core of this result lies the novel Change of Trajectory Measure Lemma -- a technical tool that bridges return-based trajectory measure and step-level distribution shift. Furthermore, for settings with access to a verifier or a rollout capability, we prove that any policy's advantage function can serve as an optimal process reward model, providing a direct connection between outcome and process supervision. These findings suggest that the empirically observed performance gap -- if any -- between outcome and process supervision likely stems from algorithmic limitations rather than inherent statistical difficulties, potentially transforming how we approach data collection and algorithm design for reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods of AllReduce scheduling oftentimes lack flexibility due to being topology-specific or relying on extensive handcrafted designs that require domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we aim to alleviate this inflexibility by proposing a deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL)-based pipeline that can generate AllReduce scheduling for various network topologies without topology-specific design features. The flow scheduling module of this pipeline consists of two hierarchically-structured DRL policies that work cooperatively to find optimal scheduling. We showcase the performance of our method compared to the baseline methods on three topologies: BCube, DCell, and Jellyfish. Finally, we contributed a Python-based simulation environment simulating AllReduce scheduling on these network topologies.</p></details> |  |

One of the core strategies for achieving this goal is to understand humans' intent--underlying psychological factors that govern their motion--by learning their reward functions, typically via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Despite significant progress in IRL, learning reward functions of multiple agents simultaneously in dense unstructured pedestrian crowds has remained intractable due to the nature of the tightly coupled social interactions that occur in these scenarios \textit{e.g.} passing, intersections, swerving, weaving, etc. In this paper, we present a new multi-agent maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm for real world unstructured pedestrian crowds. Key to our approach is a simple, but effective, mathematical trick which we name the so-called tractability-rationality trade-off trick that achieves tractability at the cost of a slight reduction in accuracy. We compare our approach to the classical single-agent MaxEnt IRL as well as state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods on several datasets including the ETH, UCY, SCAND, JRDB, and a new dataset, called Speedway, collected at a busy intersection on a University campus focusing on dense, complex agent interactions. Our key findings show that, on the dense Speedway dataset, our approach ranks 1st among top 7 baselines with >2X improvement over single-agent IRL, and is competitive with state-of-the-art large transformer-based encoder-decoder models on sparser datasets such as ETH/UCY (ranks 3rd among top 7 baselines).</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-head Reward Aggregation Guided by Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20995v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with safety guidelines typically involves reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), relying on human-generated preference annotations. However, assigning consistent overall quality ratings is challenging, prompting recent research to shift towards detailed evaluations based on multiple specific safety criteria. This paper uncovers a consistent observation: safety rules characterized by high rating entropy are generally less reliable in identifying responses preferred by humans. Leveraging this finding, we introduce ENCORE, a straightforward entropy-guided approach that composes multi-head rewards by downweighting rules exhibiting high rating entropy. Theoretically, we demonstrate that rules with elevated entropy naturally receive minimal weighting in the Bradley-Terry optimization framework, justifying our entropy-based penalization. Through extensive experiments on RewardBench safety tasks, our method significantly surpasses several competitive baselines, including random weighting, uniform weighting, single-head Bradley-Terry models, and LLM-based judging methods. Our proposed approach is training-free, broadly applicable to various datasets, and maintains interpretability, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-attribute reward modeling.</p></details> |  |

This article considers the problem of efficient sampling for toxicity detection in competitive online video games. To make optimal monitoring decisions, video game service operators need estimates of the likelihood of toxic behavior. If no model is available for these predictions, one must be estimated in real time. To close this gap, we propose a contextual bandit algorithm that makes monitoring decisions based on a small set of variables that, according to domain expertise, are associated with toxic behavior. This algorithm balances exploration and exploitation to optimize long-term outcomes and is deliberately designed for easy deployment in production. Using data from the popular first-person action game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, we show that our algorithm consistently outperforms baseline algorithms that rely solely on players' past behavior. This finding has substantive implications for the nature of toxicity. It also illustrates how domain expertise can be harnessed to help video game service operators identify and mitigate toxicity, ultimately fostering a safer and more enjoyable gaming experience.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we critically examine R1-Zero-like training by analyzing its two core components: base models and RL. We investigate a wide range of base models, including DeepSeek-V3-Base, to understand how pretraining characteristics influence RL performance. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek-V3-Base already exhibit ''Aha moment'', while Qwen2.5 base models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities even without prompt templates, suggesting potential pretraining biases. Additionally, we identify an optimization bias in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which artificially increases response length (especially for incorrect outputs) during training. To address this, we introduce Dr. GRPO, an unbiased optimization method that improves token efficiency while maintaining reasoning performance. Leveraging these insights, we present a minimalist R1-Zero recipe that achieves 43.3% accuracy on AIME 2024 with a 7B base model, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

We introduce a masked topological action space, enabling agents to explore diverse strategies for cost reduction while maintaining reliable service using the state logic as a guide for choosing proper actions. Through extensive experimentation across 20 different scenarios in a simulated 5-substation environment, we demonstrate that our approach achieves a consistent reduction in power losses, while ensuring grid stability against potential blackouts. The results underscore the effectiveness of combining dynamic observation formalization with opponent-based training, showing a viable way for autonomous management solutions in modern energy systems or even for building a foundational model for this field.</p></details> |  |

However, this progress often comes at the cost of efficiency, as models tend to overthink, generating redundant reasoning steps without proportional improvements in output quality. Long-to-Short (L2S) reasoning has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, aiming to balance reasoning depth with practical efficiency. While existing approaches, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and prompt engineering, have shown potential, they are either computationally expensive or unstable. Model merging, on the other hand, offers a cost-effective and robust alternative by integrating the quick-thinking capabilities of System 1 models with the methodical reasoning of System 2 models. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study on model merging for L2S reasoning, exploring diverse methodologies, including task-vector-based, SVD-based, and activation-informed merging. Our experiments reveal that model merging can reduce average response length by up to 55% while preserving or even improving baseline performance. We also identify a strong correlation between model scale and merging efficacy with extensive evaluations on 1.5B/7B/14B/32B models. Furthermore, we investigate the merged model's ability to self-critique and self-correct, as well as its adaptive response length based on task complexity. Our findings highlight model merging as a highly efficient and effective paradigm for L2S reasoning, offering a practical solution to the overthinking problem while maintaining the robustness of System 2 reasoning.

Existing white-box adversarial attack methods, adapted from supervised learning, fail to effectively target DRL agents as they overlook temporal dynamics and indiscriminately perturb all state dimensions, limiting their impact on long-term rewards. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Gradient-Masked Reinforcement (AGMR) Attack, a white-box attack method that combines DRL with a gradient-based soft masking mechanism to dynamically identify critical state dimensions and optimize adversarial policies. AGMR selectively allocates perturbations to the most impactful state features and incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation during training.

| **[State-Aware Perturbation Optimization for Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20613v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for robotic control. However, the deployment of DRL in real-world robots is hindered by its sensitivity to environmental perturbations. While existing whitebox adversarial attacks rely on local gradient information and apply uniform perturbations across all states to evaluate DRL robustness, they fail to account for temporal dynamics and state-specific vulnerabilities. To combat the above challenge, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of white-box attacks in DRL by establishing the adversarial victim-dynamics Markov decision process (AVD-MDP), to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a successful attack. Based on this, we propose a selective state-aware reinforcement adversarial attack method, named STAR, to optimize perturbation stealthiness and state visitation dispersion. STAR first employs a soft mask-based state-targeting mechanism to minimize redundant perturbations, enhancing stealthiness and attack effectiveness. Then, it incorporates an information-theoretic optimization objective to maximize mutual information between perturbations, environmental states, and victim actions, ensuring a dispersed state-visitation distribution that steers the victim agent into vulnerable states for maximum return reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAR outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Fully Distributed Fog Load Balancing with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12236v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time Internet of Things (IoT) applications require real-time support to handle the ever-growing demand for computing resources to process IoT workloads. Fog Computing provides high availability of such resources in a distributed manner. However, these resources must be efficiently managed to distribute unpredictable traffic demands among heterogeneous Fog resources. This paper proposes a fully distributed load-balancing solution with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) that intelligently distributes IoT workloads to optimize the waiting time while providing fair resource utilization in the Fog network. These agents use transfer learning for life-long self-adaptation to dynamic changes in the environment. By leveraging distributed decision-making, MARL agents effectively minimize the waiting time compared to a single centralized agent solution and other baselines, enhancing end-to-end execution delay. Besides performance gain, a fully distributed solution allows for a global-scale implementation where agents can work independently in small collaboration regions, leveraging nearby local resources. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of a realistic frequency to observe the state of the environment, unlike the unrealistic common assumption in the literature of having observations readily available in real-time for every required action. The findings highlight the trade-off between realism and performance using an interval-based Gossip-based multi-casting protocol against assuming real-time observation availability for every generated workload.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TNSM with 14 pages, 11 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Case-Based Reasoning System for Functional Test Script Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20576v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating functional test scripts, which necessitates understanding the dynamically evolving code structure of the target software. To achieve this, we propose a case-based reasoning (CBR) system utilizing a 4R cycle (i.e., retrieve, reuse, revise, and retain), which maintains and leverages a case bank of test intent descriptions and corresponding test scripts to facilitate LLMs for test script generation. To improve user experience further, we introduce Re4, an optimization method for the CBR system, comprising reranking-based retrieval finetuning and reinforced reuse finetuning. Specifically, we first identify positive examples with high semantic and script similarity, providing reliable pseudo-labels for finetuning the retriever model without costly labeling. Then, we apply supervised finetuning, followed by a reinforcement learning finetuning stage, to align LLMs with our production scenarios, ensuring the faithful reuse of retrieved cases. Extensive experimental results on two product development units from Huawei Datacom demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CBR+Re4. Notably, we also show that the proposed Re4 method can help alleviate the repetitive generation issues with LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, key challenges such as representation misalignment between the privileged teacher and the proprioceptive-only student, covariate shift due to behavioral cloning, and lack of deployable adaptation lead to poor generalization in real-world scenarios. We propose Teacher-Aligned Representations via Contrastive Learning (TAR), a framework that leverages privileged information with self-supervised contrastive learning to bridge this gap. By aligning representations to a privileged teacher in simulation via contrastive objectives, our student policy learns structured latent spaces and exhibits robust generalization to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios, surpassing the fully privileged "Teacher". Results showed accelerated training by 2x compared to state-of-the-art baselines to achieve peak performance. OOD scenarios showed better generalization by 40 percent on average compared to existing methods. Additionally, TAR transitions seamlessly into learning during deployment without requiring privileged states, setting a new benchmark in sample-efficient, adaptive locomotion and enabling continual fine-tuning in real-world scenarios. Open-source code and videos are available at https://ammousa.github.io/TARLoco/.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025 for review</p></details> |
| **[Harmonia: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach to Data Placement and Migration in Hybrid Storage Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20507v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid storage systems (HSS) combine multiple storage devices with diverse characteristics to achieve high performance and capacity at low cost. The performance of an HSS highly depends on the effectiveness of two key policies: (1) the data-placement policy, which determines the best-fit storage device for incoming data, and (2) the data-migration policy, which rearranges stored data across the devices to sustain high HSS performance. Prior works focus on improving only data placement or only data migration in HSS, which leads to sub-optimal HSS performance. Unfortunately, no prior work tries to optimize both policies together. Our goal is to design a holistic data-management technique for HSS that optimizes both data-placement and data-migration policies to fully exploit the potential of an HSS. We propose Harmonia, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based data-management technique that employs two light-weight autonomous RL agents, a data-placement agent and a data-migration agent, which adapt their policies for the current workload and HSS configuration, and coordinate with each other to improve overall HSS performance. We evaluate Harmonia on a real HSS with up to four heterogeneous storage devices with diverse characteristics. Our evaluation using 17 data-intensive workloads on performance-optimized (cost-optimized) HSS with two storage devices shows that, on average, Harmonia (1) outperforms the best-performing prior approach by 49.5% (31.7%), (2) bridges the performance gap between the best-performing prior work and Oracle by 64.2% (64.3%). On an HSS with three (four) devices, Harmonia outperforms the best-performing prior work by 37.0% (42.0%). Harmonia's performance benefits come with low latency (240ns for inference) and storage overheads (206 KiB for both RL agents together). We plan to open-source Harmonia's implementation to aid future research on HSS.</p></details> |  |

Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) offers improved sample efficiency and generalizability compared to Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (MFRL) in various multi-agent decision-making scenarios. Nevertheless, MBRL faces critical difficulties in estimating uncertainty during the model learning phase, thereby limiting its scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios. Additionally, most Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) studies focus on single-agent decision-making, while existing multi-agent MBRL solutions lack computationally tractable algorithms with Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) guarantees, an essential factor for ensuring policy reliability with limited training data. To address these challenges, we propose MA-PMBRL, a novel Multi-Agent Pessimistic Model-Based Reinforcement Learning framework for CAVs, incorporating a max-min optimization approach to enhance robustness and decision-making. To mitigate the inherent subjectivity of uncertainty estimation in MBRL and avoid incurring catastrophic failures in AV, MA-PMBRL employs a pessimistic optimization framework combined with Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) for both model and policy learning. MA-PMBRL also employs general function approximations under partial dataset coverage to enhance learning efficiency and system-level performance. By bounding the suboptimality of the resulting policy under mild theoretical assumptions, we successfully establish PAC guarantees for MA-PMBRL, demonstrating that the proposed framework represents a significant step toward scalable, efficient, and reliable multi-agent decision-making for CAVs.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

However, their performance can be limited by the quality of the training data and its inherent biases. While Preference Optimization (PO) methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have been applied to align generative models with human preferences, their use in contrastive learning has yet to be explored. This paper introduces a novel method for training contrastive learning models using different PO methods to break down complex concepts. Our method systematically aligns model behavior with desired preferences, enhancing performance on the targeted task. In particular, we focus on enhancing model robustness against typographic attacks and inductive biases, commonly seen in contrastive vision-language models like CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained using PO outperform standard contrastive learning techniques while retaining their ability to handle adversarial challenges and maintain accuracy on other downstream tasks. This makes our method well-suited for tasks requiring fairness, robustness, and alignment with specific preferences. We evaluate our method for tackling typographic attacks on images and explore its ability to disentangle gender concepts and mitigate gender bias, showcasing the versatility of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Crucial Role of Problem Formulation in Real-World Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20442v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers promising solutions for control tasks in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs), yet its real-world adoption remains limited. This paper demonstrates how seemingly small but well-designed modifications to the RL problem formulation can substantially improve performance, stability, and sample efficiency. We identify and investigate key elements of RL problem formulation and show that these enhance both learning speed and final policy quality. Our experiments use a one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF) helicopter testbed, the Quanser Aero~2, which features non-linear dynamics representative of many industrial settings. In simulation, the proposed problem design principles yield more reliable and efficient training, and we further validate these results by training the agent directly on physical hardware. The encouraging real-world outcomes highlight the potential of RL for ICPS, especially when careful attention is paid to the design principles of problem formulation. Overall, our study underscores the crucial role of thoughtful problem formulation in bridging the gap between RL research and the demands of real-world industrial systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPS 2025</p></details> |

Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others, inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Similarity Distillation: Ensemble Uncertainties with a Single Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11339v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification is a critical aspect of reinforcement learning and deep learning, with numerous applications ranging from efficient exploration and stable offline reinforcement learning to outlier detection in medical diagnostics. The scale of modern neural networks, however, complicates the use of many theoretically well-motivated approaches such as full Bayesian inference. Approximate methods like deep ensembles can provide reliable uncertainty estimates but still remain computationally expensive. In this work, we propose contextual similarity distillation, a novel approach that explicitly estimates the variance of an ensemble of deep neural networks with a single model, without ever learning or evaluating such an ensemble in the first place. Our method builds on the predictable learning dynamics of wide neural networks, governed by the neural tangent kernel, to derive an efficient approximation of the predictive variance of an infinite ensemble. Specifically, we reinterpret the computation of ensemble variance as a supervised regression problem with kernel similarities as regression targets. The resulting model can estimate predictive variance at inference time with a single forward pass, and can make use of unlabeled target-domain data or data augmentations to refine its uncertainty estimates. We empirically validate our method across a variety of out-of-distribution detection benchmarks and sparse-reward reinforcement learning environments. We find that our single-model method performs competitively and sometimes superior to ensemble-based baselines and serves as a reliable signal for efficient exploration. These results, we believe, position contextual similarity distillation as a principled and scalable alternative for uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning and general deep learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaDE: Evolving Differential Evolution by Differential Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10470v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a cornerstone in the Evolutionary Computation (EC) domain, Differential Evolution (DE) is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling challenging black-box optimization problems. While the advantages of DE are well-recognized, achieving peak performance heavily depends on its hyperparameters such as the mutation factor, crossover probability, and the selection of specific DE strategies. Traditional approaches to this hyperparameter dilemma have leaned towards parameter tuning or adaptive mechanisms. However, identifying the optimal settings tailored for specific problems remains a persistent challenge. In response, we introduce MetaDE, an approach that evolves DE's intrinsic hyperparameters and strategies using DE itself at a meta-level. A pivotal aspect of MetaDE is a specialized parameterization technique, which endows it with the capability to dynamically modify DE's parameters and strategies throughout the evolutionary process. To augment computational efficiency, MetaDE incorporates a design that leverages parallel processing through a GPU-accelerated computing framework. Within such a framework, DE is not just a solver but also an optimizer for its own configurations, thus streamlining the process of hyperparameter optimization and problem-solving into a cohesive and automated workflow. Extensive evaluations on the CEC2022 benchmark suite demonstrate MetaDE's promising performance. Moreover, when applied to robot control via evolutionary reinforcement learning, MetaDE also demonstrates promising performance.

We begin with a concise overview of the typical steps involved in RLHF and LRMs. Next, we reinterpret several RL-based and RL-free algorithms through the perspective of neural structured bandit prediction, providing a clear conceptual framework that uncovers a deeper connection between these seemingly distinct approaches. Following this, we briefly review some core principles of reinforcement learning, drawing attention to an often-overlooked aspect in existing RLHF studies. This leads to a detailed derivation of the standard RLHF objective within a full RL context, demonstrating its equivalence to neural structured bandit prediction. Finally, by reinvestigating the principles behind Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we pinpoint areas needing adjustment, which culminates in the introduction of the Generalized Reinforce Optimization (GRO) framework, seamlessly integrating RL-based and RL-free methods in RLHF. We look forward to the community's efforts to empirically validate GRO and invite constructive feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20285v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) constructs environment models from offline datasets to perform conservative policy optimization. Existing approaches focus on learning state transitions through ensemble models, rollouting conservative estimation to mitigate extrapolation errors. However, the static data makes it challenging to develop a robust policy, and offline agents cannot access the environment to gather new data. To address these challenges, we introduce Model-based Offline Reinforcement learning with AdversariaL data augmentation (MORAL). In MORAL, we replace the fixed horizon rollout by employing adversaria data augmentation to execute alternating sampling with ensemble models to enrich training data. Specifically, this adversarial process dynamically selects ensemble models against policy for biased sampling, mitigating the optimistic estimation of fixed models, thus robustly expanding the training data for policy optimization. Moreover, a differential factor is integrated into the adversarial process for regularization, ensuring error minimization in extrapolations. This data-augmented optimization adapts to diverse offline tasks without rollout horizon tuning, showing remarkable applicability. Extensive experiments on D4RL benchmark demonstrate that MORAL outperforms other model-based offline RL methods in terms of policy learning and sample efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference Optimization with Multi-Sample Comparisons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12138v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, have been driven by extensive pretraining on large datasets followed by post-training. However, current post-training methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct alignment from preference methods (DAP) primarily utilize single-sample comparisons. These approaches often fail to capture critical characteristics such as generative diversity and bias, which are more accurately assessed through multiple samples. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel approach that extends post-training to include multi-sample comparisons. To achieve this, we propose Multi-sample Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) and Multi-sample Identity Preference Optimization (mIPO). These methods improve traditional DAP methods by focusing on group-wise characteristics. Empirically, we demonstrate that multi-sample comparison is more effective in optimizing collective characteristics~(e.g., diversity and bias) for generative models than single-sample comparison. Additionally, our findings suggest that multi-sample comparisons provide a more robust optimization framework, particularly for dataset with label noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/alecwangcq/multi-sample-alignment</p></details> |

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved notable success in steering models, but is complex and can be unstable. Recent approaches such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplify preference-based fine-tuning but may introduce bias or trade-off certain objectives~\cite{dpo}. In this work, we propose a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework with a multi-label reward regression model to achieve safe and aligned language generation. The GRPO algorithm optimizes a policy by comparing groups of sampled responses, eliminating the need for a separate value critic and improving training efficiency~\cite{grpo}. We train a reward model to predict multiple alignment scores (e.g., safety, helpfulness, etc.), which are combined into a single reward signal. We provide a theoretical derivation for using this learned multi-aspect reward within GRPO and discuss its advantages and limitations. Empirically, our approach improves all the safety and quality metrics evaluated in language generation tasks on model scales (0.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters), demonstrating a robust balance of objectives. We compare GRPO to PPO-based RLHF and DPO, highlighting that GRPO achieves alignment with significantly lower computational cost and explicit multi-objective handling. \textbf{We will open-source all trained models at https://huggingface.co/hydroxai.</p></details> |  |

This work tackles two key challenges: efficient skill acquisition from limited human demonstrations and context-driven skill selection. We introduce AdaDexGrasp, a framework that learns a library of grasping skills from a single human demonstration per skill and selects the most suitable one using a vision-language model (VLM). To improve sample efficiency, we propose a trajectory following reward that guides reinforcement learning (RL) toward states close to a human demonstration while allowing flexibility in exploration. To learn beyond the single demonstration, we employ curriculum learning, progressively increasing object pose variations to enhance robustness. At deployment, a VLM retrieves the appropriate skill based on user instructions, bridging low-level learned skills with high-level intent. We evaluate AdaDexGrasp in both simulation and real-world settings, showing that our approach significantly improves RL efficiency and enables learning human-like grasp strategies across varied object configurations. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of our learned policies to a real-world PSYONIC Ability Hand, with a 90% success rate across objects, significantly outperforming the baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, most of the current traffic state representations are heuristically designed, with insufficient theoretical support. In this paper, we (1) develop a flexible, efficient, and theoretically grounded method, namely generalized phase pressure (G2P) control, which takes only simple lane features into consideration to decide which phase to be actuated; 2) extend the pressure control theory to a general form for multi-homogeneous-lane road networks based on queueing theory; (3) design a new traffic state representation based on the generalized phase state features from G2P control; and 4) develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm template named G2P-XLight, and two RL algorithms, G2P-MPLight and G2P-CoLight, by combining the generalized phase state representation with MPLight and CoLight, two well-performed RL methods for learning traffic signal control policies. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that G2P control outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) heuristic method in the transportation field and other recent human-designed heuristic methods; and that the newly proposed G2P-XLight significantly outperforms SOTA learning-based approaches.

| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning with Discrete Diffusion Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20176v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skills have been introduced to offline reinforcement learning (RL) as temporal abstractions to tackle complex, long-horizon tasks, promoting consistent behavior and enabling meaningful exploration. While skills in offline RL are predominantly modeled within a continuous latent space, the potential of discrete skill spaces remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a compact discrete skill space for offline RL tasks supported by state-of-the-art transformer-based encoder and diffusion-based decoder. Coupled with a high-level policy trained via offline RL techniques, our method establishes a hierarchical RL framework where the trained diffusion decoder plays a pivotal role. Empirical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm, Discrete Diffusion Skill (DDS), is a powerful offline RL method. DDS performs competitively on Locomotion and Kitchen tasks and excels on long-horizon tasks, achieving at least a 12 percent improvement on AntMaze-v2 benchmarks compared to existing offline RL approaches. Furthermore, DDS offers improved interpretability, training stability, and online exploration compared to previous skill-based methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the presence of inaccurate models can introduce biases during policy learning, resulting in misleading trajectories. The challenge lies in obtaining accurate models due to limited diverse training data, particularly in regions with limited visits (uncertain regions). Existing approaches passively quantify uncertainty after sample generation, failing to actively collect uncertain samples that could enhance state coverage and improve model accuracy. Moreover, MBRL often faces difficulties in making accurate multi-step predictions, thereby impacting overall performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for uncertainty-aware policy optimization with model-based exploratory planning. In the model-based planning phase, we introduce an uncertainty-aware k-step lookahead planning approach to guide action selection at each step. This process involves a trade-off analysis between model uncertainty and value function approximation error, effectively enhancing policy performance. In the policy optimization phase, we leverage an uncertainty-driven exploratory policy to actively collect diverse training samples, resulting in improved model accuracy and overall performance of the RL agent. Our approach offers flexibility and applicability to tasks with varying state/action spaces and reward structures. We validate its effectiveness through experiments on challenging robotic manipulation tasks and Atari games, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with fewer interactions, thereby leading to significant performance improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesizing world models for bilevel planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20124v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex environments, such as video games. However, they still fall short of achieving human-like sample efficiency and adaptability when learning new domains. Theory-based reinforcement learning (TBRL) is an algorithmic framework specifically designed to address this gap. Modeled on cognitive theories, TBRL leverages structured, causal world models - "theories" - as forward simulators for use in planning, generalization and exploration. Although current TBRL systems provide compelling explanations of how humans learn to play video games, they face several technical limitations: their theory languages are restrictive, and their planning algorithms are not scalable. To address these challenges, we introduce TheoryCoder, an instantiation of TBRL that exploits hierarchical representations of theories and efficient program synthesis methods for more powerful learning and planning. TheoryCoder equips agents with general-purpose abstractions (e.g., "move to"), which are then grounded in a particular environment by learning a low-level transition model (a Python program synthesized from observations by a large language model). A bilevel planning algorithm can exploit this hierarchical structure to solve large domains. We demonstrate that this approach can be successfully applied to diverse and challenging grid-world games, where approaches based on directly synthesizing a policy perform poorly. Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of using hierarchical abstractions.</p></details> | 25 pages |

Frameworks such as Unity's ML-Agents help to make such reinforcement learning experiments more accessible to the simulation community. Military training simulations also benefit from advances in MARL, but they have immense computational requirements due to their complex, continuous, stochastic, partially observable, non-stationary, and doctrine-based nature. Furthermore, these simulations require geo-specific terrains, further exacerbating the computational resources problem. In our research, we leverage Unity's waypoints to automatically generate multi-layered representation abstractions of the geo-specific terrains to scale up reinforcement learning while still allowing the transfer of learned policies between different representations. Our early exploratory results on a novel MARL scenario, where each side has differing objectives, indicate that waypoint-based navigation enables faster and more efficient learning while producing trajectories similar to those taken by expert human players in CSGO gaming environments. This research points out the potential of waypoint-based navigation for reducing the computational costs of developing and training MARL models for military training simulations, where geo-specific terrains and differing objectives are crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2024 Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation, and Education Conference (I/ITSEC)</p></details> |

We theoretically analyze several properties of this approach and complement with a numerical ablation study, which serves to illustrate the policy optimization dynamics on the value polytope, relative to different algorithmic design choices in this space. We further characterize numerically several features of the problem setting relevant for functional acceleration, and lastly, we investigate the impact of approximation on their learning mechanics.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, current models are constrained by limitations in handling long texts and reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective test-time scaling approach Multi-round Thinking. This method iteratively refines model reasoning by leveraging previous answers as prompts for subsequent rounds.

| **[Simplifying Deep Temporal Difference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04811v5)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Q-learning played a foundational role in the field reinforcement learning (RL). However, TD algorithms with off-policy data, such as Q-learning, or nonlinear function approximation like deep neural networks require several additional tricks to stabilise training, primarily a large replay buffer and target networks. Unfortunately, the delayed updating of frozen network parameters in the target network harms the sample efficiency and, similarly, the large replay buffer introduces memory and implementation overheads. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to accelerate and simplify off-policy TD training while maintaining its stability. Our key theoretical result demonstrates for the first time that regularisation techniques such as LayerNorm can yield provably convergent TD algorithms without the need for a target network or replay buffer, even with off-policy data. Empirically, we find that online, parallelised sampling enabled by vectorised environments stabilises training without the need for a large replay buffer. Motivated by these findings, we propose PQN, our simplified deep online Q-Learning algorithm. Surprisingly, this simple algorithm is competitive with more complex methods like: Rainbow in Atari, PPO-RNN in Craftax, QMix in Smax, and can be up to 50x faster than traditional DQN without sacrificing sample efficiency. In an era where PPO has become the go-to RL algorithm, PQN reestablishes off-policy Q-learning as a viable alternative.</p></details> |  |

This work addresses this question by training VLMs to think about preferences at test time, employing reinforcement learning methods inspired by DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI O1. Using datasets such as ImageReward and Human Preference Score v2 (HPSv2), our models achieve accuracies of 64.9% on the ImageReward test set (trained on ImageReward official split) and 65.4% on HPSv2 (trained on approximately 25% of its data). These results match traditional encoder-based models while providing transparent reasoning and enhanced generalization. This approach allows to use not only rich VLM world knowledge, but also its potential to think, yielding interpretable outcomes that help decision-making processes. By demonstrating that human visual preferences reasonable by current VLMs, we introduce efficient soft-reward strategies for image ranking, outperforming simplistic selection or scoring methods. This reasoning capability enables VLMs to rank arbitrary images-regardless of aspect ratio or complexity-thereby potentially amplifying the effectiveness of visual Preference Optimization. By reducing the need for extensive markup while improving reward generalization and explainability, our findings can be a strong mile-stone that will enhance text-to-vision models even further.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Persona Consistency for LLMs' Role-Playing using Persona-Aware Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17662v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved breakthrough progress in many dialogue generation tasks. However, their lack of emotion and fine-grained role awareness limits the model's ability to provide personalized and diverse interactions further. Current methods face high costs in collecting high-quality annotated data for scenarios such as role-playing, and traditional human alignment methods are difficult to deploy due to the inherent diversity of model behavior in role-playing scenarios. Inspired by the alignment of models for safety behaviors through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), in this paper, we revisit model role-playing behavior from the perspective of persona alignment and propose a novel annotation-free framework named \textbf{\underline{P}}ersona-Aware \textbf{\underline{C}}ontrastive \textbf{\underline{L}}earning (PCL) to align LLMs' behavior during role-playing, enhancing the model's role consistency. Specifically, we first design a role chain method to encourage the model to self-question based on the role characteristics and dialogue context to adjust personality consistency. Then, we further enhance the model's role-playing strategy through iterative contrastive learning between the use of role characteristics and not. Experiments on both black-box and white-box LLMs show that LLMs equipped with PCL significantly outperform vanilla LLMs under automatic evaluation methods (CharEval \& GPT-4) and human expert evaluation.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

Our algorithm relies on viewing chain-of-thought as latent variable as part of a probabilistic inference problem. Contrary to the full evidence lower bound, we propose to apply a much simpler Jensen's lower bound, which derives tractable objectives with simple algorithmic components (e.g., without the need for parametric approximate posterior), making it more conducive to modern large-scale training. The lower bound approach naturally interpolates other methods such as supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning, whose practical trade-offs we will illustrate. Finally, we show that on mathematical reasoning problems, optimizing with Jensen's lower bound is as effective as policy gradient with external reward. Taken together, our results showcase as a proof of concept to this new algorithmic paradigm's potential to more generic applications.</p></details> |  |

AGRO leverages the concept of generation consistency, which states that the optimal policy satisfies the notion of consistency across any possible generation of the model. We derive algorithms that find optimal solutions via the sample-based policy gradient and provide theoretical guarantees on their convergence. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AGRO in both on-policy and off-policy settings, showing improved performance on the mathematical reasoning dataset over baseline algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL-RC-DoT: A Block-level RL agent for Task-Aware Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12216v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video encoders optimize compression for human perception by minimizing reconstruction error under bit-rate constraints. In many modern applications such as autonomous driving, an overwhelming majority of videos serve as input for AI systems performing tasks like object recognition or segmentation, rather than being watched by humans. It is therefore useful to optimize the encoder for a downstream task instead of for perceptual image quality. However, a major challenge is how to combine such downstream optimization with existing standard video encoders, which are highly efficient and popular. Here, we address this challenge by controlling the Quantization Parameters (QPs) at the macro-block level to optimize the downstream task. This granular control allows us to prioritize encoding for task-relevant regions within each frame. We formulate this optimization problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) task, where the agent learns to balance long-term implications of choosing QPs on both task performance and bit-rate constraints. Notably, our policy does not require the downstream task as an input during inference, making it suitable for streaming applications and edge devices such as vehicles. We demonstrate significant improvements in two tasks, car detection, and ROI (saliency) encoding. Our approach improves task performance for a given bit rate compared to traditional task agnostic encoding methods, paving the way for more efficient task-aware video compression.</p></details> |  |

We show how optimizing for inference time performance can improve overall model efficacy. We consider generic inference time objectives with $k$ samples, with a focus on pass@$k$ and majority voting as two main applications. With language model training on reasoning datasets, we showcase the performance trade-off enabled by training with such objectives. When training on code generation tasks, we show that the approach significantly improves pass@$k$ objectives compared to the baseline method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Evaluation Models from Large Language Models for Sequence Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04386v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic evaluation of sequence generation, traditionally reliant on metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, often fails to capture the semantic accuracy of generated text sequences due to their emphasis on n-gram overlap. A promising solution to this problem is to develop model-based metrics, such as BLEURT and COMET. However, these approaches are typically hindered by the scarcity of labeled evaluation data, which is necessary to train the evaluation models. In this work, we build upon this challenge by proposing the Customized Sequence Evaluation Metric (CSEM), a three-stage evaluation model training method that utilizes large language models to generate labeled data for model-based metric development, thereby eliminating the need for human-labeled data. Additionally, we expand the scope of CSEM to support various evaluation types, including single-aspect, multi-aspect, reference-free, and reference-based evaluations, enabling the customization of metrics to suit diverse real-world scenarios. Experimental results on the SummEval benchmark demonstrate that CSEM can effectively train an evaluation model without human-labeled data. Further experiments in reinforcement learning and reranking show that metrics developed through CSEM outperform traditional evaluation metrics, leading to substantial improvements in sequence quality as evaluated by both commonly used metrics and ChatGPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review in TASLP</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Shielding for Safe Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07671v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-life scenarios, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent aiming to maximise their reward, must often also behave in a safe manner, including at training time. Thus, much attention in recent years has been given to Safe RL, where an agent aims to learn an optimal policy among all policies that satisfy a given safety constraint. However, strict safety guarantees are often provided through approaches based on linear programming, and thus have limited scaling. In this paper we present a new, scalable method, which enjoys strict formal guarantees for Safe RL, in the case where the safety dynamics of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) are known, and safety is defined as an undiscounted probabilistic avoidance property. Our approach is based on state-augmentation of the MDP, and on the design of a shield that restricts the actions available to the agent. We show that our approach provides a strict formal safety guarantee that the agent stays safe at training and test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach is viable in practice through experimental evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, Conference: AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Machine learning algorithms constitute the state-of-the-art in many fields but require vast data sets, which are costly and time-intensive to collect. Automated strategies for observation and exploration are crucial to enhance the efficiency of data gathering. Therefore, a novel strategy utilizing the Next-Best-Trajectory principle is developed for a robot manipulator operating in dynamic environments. Local trajectories are generated to maximize the information gained from observations along the path while avoiding collisions. We employ a voxel map for environment modeling and utilize raycasting from perspectives around a point of interest to estimate the information gain. A global ergodic trajectory planner provides an optional reference trajectory to the local planner, improving exploration and helping to avoid local minima. To enhance computational efficiency, raycasting for estimating the information gain in the environment is executed in parallel on the graphics processing unit. Benchmark results confirm the efficiency of the parallelization, while real-world experiments demonstrate the strategy's effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Multi-Robot Coordination through Locality-Based Factorized Multi-Agent Actor-Critic Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18816v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present a novel cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning method called \textbf{Loc}ality based \textbf{Fac}torized \textbf{M}ulti-Agent \textbf{A}ctor-\textbf{C}ritic (Loc-FACMAC). Existing state-of-the-art algorithms, such as FACMAC, rely on global reward information, which may not accurately reflect the quality of individual robots' actions in decentralized systems. We integrate the concept of locality into critic learning, where strongly related robots form partitions during training. Robots within the same partition have a greater impact on each other, leading to more precise policy evaluation. Additionally, we construct a dependency graph to capture the relationships between robots, facilitating the partitioning process. This approach mitigates the curse of dimensionality and prevents robots from using irrelevant information. Our method improves existing algorithms by focusing on local rewards and leveraging partition-based learning to enhance training efficiency and performance. We evaluate the performance of Loc-FACMAC in three environments: Hallway, Multi-cartpole, and Bounded-Cooperative-Navigation. We explore the impact of partition sizes on the performance and compare the result with baseline MARL algorithms such as LOMAQ, FACMAC, and QMIX. The experiments reveal that, if the locality structure is defined properly, Loc-FACMAC outperforms these baseline algorithms up to 108\%, indicating that exploiting the locality structure in the actor-critic framework improves the MARL performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Centralized Planning and Distributed Execution Method for Shape Filling with Homogeneous Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22522v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nature has inspired humans in different ways. The formation behavior of animals can perform tasks that exceed individual capability. For example, army ants could transverse gaps by forming bridges, and fishes could group up to protect themselves from predators. The pattern formation task is essential in a multiagent robotic system because it usually serves as the initial configuration of downstream tasks, such as collective manipulation and adaptation to various environments. The formation of complex shapes, especially hollow shapes, remains an open question. Traditional approaches either require global coordinates for each robot or are prone to failure when attempting to close the hole due to accumulated localization errors. Inspired by the ribbon idea introduced in the additive self-assembly algorithm by the Kilobot team, we develop a two-stage algorithm that does not require global coordinates information and effectively forms shapes with holes. In this paper, we investigate the partitioning of the shape using ribbons in a hexagonal lattice setting and propose the add-subtract algorithm based on the movement sequence induced by the ribbon structure. This advancement opens the door to tasks requiring complex pattern formations, such as the assembly of nanobots for medical applications involving intricate structures and the deployment of robots along the boundaries of areas of interest. We also provide simulation results on complex shapes, an analysis of the robustness as well as a proof of correctness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Freeze Tag: a Sustainable Solution to Discover and Wake-up a Robot Swarm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22521v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Freeze Tag Problem consists in waking up a swarm of robots starting with one initially awake robot. Whereas there is a wide literature of the centralized setting, where the location of the robots is known in advance, we focus in the distributed version where the location of the robots $\P$ are unknown, and where awake robots only detect other robots up to distance~$1$. Assuming that moving at distance $\delta$ takes a time $\delta$, we show that waking up of the whole swarm takes $O(\rho+\ell^2\log( \rho/\ell))$, where $\rho$ stands for the largest distance from the initial robot to any point of $\P$, and the $\ell$ is the connectivity threshold of $\P$. Moreover, the result is complemented by a matching lower bound in both parameters $\rho$ and $\ell$. We also provide other distributed algorithms, complemented with lower bounds, whenever each robot has a bounded amount of energy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Control of Humanoid Robots with Parallel Mechanisms using Kinematic Actuation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22459v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the mechanical design of Cassie, several recently released humanoid robots are using actuator configuration in which the motor is displaced from the joint location to optimize the leg inertia. This in turn induces a non linearity in the reduction ratio of the transmission which is often neglected when computing the robot motion (e.g. by trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning) and only accounted for at control time. This paper proposes an analytical method to efficiently handle this non-linearity. Using this actuation model, we demonstrate that we can leverage the dynamic abilities of the non-linear transmission while only modeling the inertia of the main serial chain of the leg, without approximating the motor capabilities nor the joint range. Based on analytical inverse kinematics, our method does not need any numerical routines dedicated to the closed-kinematics actuation, hence leading to very efficient computations. Our study focuses on two mechanisms widely used in recent humanoid robots; the four bar knee linkage as well as a parallel 2 DoF ankle mechanism. We integrate these models inside optimization based (DDP) and learning (PPO) control approaches. A comparison of our model against a simplified model that completely neglects closed chains is then shown in simulation.</p></details> |  |

Conventional approaches, bogged down by manual processes and siloed expertise, struggle to keep pace with the demands of modern discovery. We envision an autonomous generalist scientist (AGS) system-a fusion of agentic AI and embodied robotics-that redefines the research lifecycle. This system promises to autonomously navigate physical and digital realms, weaving together insights from disparate disciplines with unprecedented efficiency. By embedding advanced AI and robot technologies into every phase-from hypothesis formulation to peer-ready manuscripts-AGS could slash the time and resources needed for scientific research in diverse field. We foresee a future where scientific discovery follows new scaling laws, driven by the proliferation and sophistication of such systems. As these autonomous agents and robots adapt to extreme environments and leverage a growing reservoir of knowledge, they could spark a paradigm shift, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and ushering in an era of relentless innovation.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |
| **[The Role of Robot Competence, Autonomy, and Personality on Trust Formation in Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04296v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trust in social robots is a complex attitude based on cognitive and emotional evaluations, as well as a behavior, like task delegation. While previous research explored the features of robots that influence overall trust attitude, it remains unclear whether these features affect behavioral trust. Additionally, there is limited investigation into which features of robots influence cognitive and emotional attitudes, and how these attitudes impact humans' willingness to delegate new tasks to robots. This study examines the interplay between competence, autonomy, and personality traits of robots and their impact on trust attitudes (cognitive and affective trust) and trust behavior (task delegation), within the context of task-oriented Human-Robot Interaction. Our findings indicate that robot competence is a key determinant of trust, influencing cognitive, affective, and behavioral trust. In contrast, robot personality traits significantly impact only affective trust without affecting cognitive trust or trust behavior. In addition, autonomy was found to moderate the relationship between competence and cognitive trust, as well as between personality and affective trust. Finally, cognitive trust was found to positively influence task delegation, whereas affective trust did not show a significant effect. This paper contributes to the literature on Human-Robot Trust by providing novel evidence that enhances the acceptance and effectiveness of social robots in collaborative scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous-Time State Estimation Methods in Robotics: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03951v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, efficient, and robust state estimation is more important than ever in robotics as the variety of platforms and complexity of tasks continue to grow. Historically, discrete-time filters and smoothers have been the dominant approach, in which the estimated variables are states at discrete sample times. The paradigm of continuous-time state estimation proposes an alternative strategy by estimating variables that express the state as a continuous function of time, which can be evaluated at any query time. Not only can this benefit downstream tasks such as planning and control, but it also significantly increases estimator performance and flexibility, as well as reduces sensor preprocessing and interfacing complexity. Despite this, continuous-time methods remain underutilized, potentially because they are less well-known within robotics. To remedy this, this work presents a unifying formulation of these methods and the most exhaustive literature review to date, systematically categorizing prior work by methodology, application, state variables, historical context, and theoretical contribution to the field. By surveying splines and Gaussian processes together and contextualizing works from other research domains, this work identifies and analyzes open problems in continuous-time state estimation and suggests new research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)</p></details> |
| **[Robust simultaneous UWB-anchor calibration and robot localization for emergency situations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22272v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a factor graph optimization (FGO) framework to simultaneously solve the calibration problem for Ultra-WideBand (UWB) anchors and the robot localization problem. Calibrating UWB anchors manually can be time-consuming and even impossible in emergencies or those situations without special calibration tools. Therefore, automatic estimation of the anchor positions becomes a necessity. The proposed method enables the creation of a soft sensor providing the position information of the anchors in a UWB network. This soft sensor requires only UWB and LiDAR measurements measured from a moving robot. The proposed FGO framework is suitable for the calibration of an extendable large UWB network. Moreover, the anchor calibration problem and robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously, which saves time for UWB network deployment. The proposed framework also helps to avoid artificial errors in the UWB-anchor position estimation and improves the accuracy and robustness of the robot-pose. The experimental results of the robot localization using LiDAR and a UWB network in a 3D environment are discussed, demonstrating the performance of the proposed method. More specifically, the anchor calibration problem with four anchors and the robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously and automatically within 30 seconds by the proposed framework. The supplementary video and codes can be accessed via https://github.com/LiuxhRobotAI/Simultaneous_calibration_localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[REMAC: Self-Reflective and Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Collaboration for Long-Horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22122v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in robotic planning, particularly for long-horizon tasks that require a holistic understanding of the environment for task decomposition. Existing methods typically rely on prior environmental knowledge or carefully designed task-specific prompts, making them struggle with dynamic scene changes or unexpected task conditions, e.g., a robot attempting to put a carrot in the microwave but finds the door was closed. Such challenges underscore two critical issues: adaptability and efficiency. To address them, in this work, we propose an adaptive multi-agent planning framework, termed REMAC, that enables efficient, scene-agnostic multi-robot long-horizon task planning and execution through continuous reflection and self-evolution. REMAC incorporates two key modules: a self-reflection module performing pre-condition and post-condition checks in the loop to evaluate progress and refine plans, and a self-evolvement module dynamically adapting plans based on scene-specific reasoning. It offers several appealing benefits: 1) Robots can initially explore and reason about the environment without complex prompt design. 2) Robots can keep reflecting on potential planning errors and adapting the plan based on task-specific insights. 3) After iterations, a robot can call another one to coordinate tasks in parallel, maximizing the task execution efficiency. To validate REMAC's effectiveness, we build a multi-agent environment for long-horizon robot manipulation and navigation based on RoboCasa, featuring 4 task categories with 27 task styles and 50+ different objects. Based on it, we further benchmark state-of-the-art reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1, o3-mini, QwQ, and Grok3, demonstrating REMAC's superiority by boosting average success rates by 40% and execution efficiency by 52.7% over the single robot baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics-Guided Diffusion Model for Sensor-less Robot Manipulator Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15038v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Dynamics-Guided Diffusion Model (DGDM), a data-driven framework for generating task-specific manipulator designs without task-specific training. Given object shapes and task specifications, DGDM generates sensor-less manipulator designs that can blindly manipulate objects towards desired motions and poses using an open-loop parallel motion. This framework 1) flexibly represents manipulation tasks as interaction profiles, 2) represents the design space using a geometric diffusion model, and 3) efficiently searches this design space using the gradients provided by a dynamics network trained without any task information. We evaluate DGDM on various manipulation tasks ranging from shifting/rotating objects to converging objects to a specific pose. Our generated designs outperform optimization-based and unguided diffusion baselines relatively by 31.5% and 45.3% on average success rate. With the ability to generate a new design within 0.8s, DGDM facilitates rapid design iteration and enhances the adoption of data-driven approaches for robot mechanism design. Qualitative results are best viewed on our project website https://dgdm-robot.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

The big question remains, how can we bridge the embodiment gap while minimizing physical robot learning, which fundamentally does not scale well. We argue that learning from in-the-wild human videos offers a promising solution for robotic manipulation tasks, as vast amounts of relevant data already exist on the internet. In this work, we present VidBot, a framework enabling zero-shot robotic manipulation using learned 3D affordance from in-the-wild monocular RGB-only human videos. VidBot leverages a pipeline to extract explicit representations from them, namely 3D hand trajectories from videos, combining a depth foundation model with structure-from-motion techniques to reconstruct temporally consistent, metric-scale 3D affordance representations agnostic to embodiments. We introduce a coarse-to-fine affordance learning model that first identifies coarse actions from the pixel space and then generates fine-grained interaction trajectories with a diffusion model, conditioned on coarse actions and guided by test-time constraints for context-aware interaction planning, enabling substantial generalization to novel scenes and embodiments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of VidBot, which significantly outperforms counterparts across 13 manipulation tasks in zero-shot settings and can be seamlessly deployed across robot systems in real-world environments. VidBot paves the way for leveraging everyday human videos to make robot learning more scalable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

This research investigates ways to enhance user control in social robot navigation, based on two studies conducted with blind participants. The first study, involving structured interviews (N=14), identified crowded spaces as key areas with significant social challenges. The second study (N=13) explored navigation tasks with an autonomous robot in these environments and identified design strategies across different modes of autonomy. Participants preferred an active role, termed the "boss" mode, where they managed crowd interactions, while the "monitor" mode helped them assess the environment, negotiate movements, and interact with the robot. These findings highlight the importance of shared control and user involvement for blind users, offering valuable insights for designing future social navigation robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Bresa: Bio-inspired Reflexive Safe Reinforcement Learning for Contact-Rich Robotic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21989v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in reinforcement learning (RL)-based robotic systems is a critical challenge, especially in contact-rich tasks within unstructured environments. While the state-of-the-art safe RL approaches mitigate risks through safe exploration or high-level recovery mechanisms, they often overlook low-level execution safety, where reflexive responses to potential hazards are crucial. Similarly, variable impedance control (VIC) enhances safety by adjusting the robot's mechanical response, yet lacks a systematic way to adapt parameters, such as stiffness and damping throughout the task. In this paper, we propose Bresa, a Bio-inspired Reflexive Hierarchical Safe RL method inspired by biological reflexes. Our method decouples task learning from safety learning, incorporating a safety critic network that evaluates action risks and operates at a higher frequency than the task solver. Unlike existing recovery-based methods, our safety critic functions at a low-level control layer, allowing real-time intervention when unsafe conditions arise. The task-solving RL policy, running at a lower frequency, focuses on high-level planning (decision-making), while the safety critic ensures instantaneous safety corrections. We validate Bresa on multiple tasks including a contact-rich robotic task, demonstrating its reflexive ability to enhance safety, and adaptability in unforeseen dynamic environments.

| **[Pretrained Bayesian Non-parametric Knowledge Prior in Robotic Long-Horizon Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21975v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) methods typically learn new tasks from scratch, often disregarding prior knowledge that could accelerate the learning process. While some methods incorporate previously learned skills, they usually rely on a fixed structure, such as a single Gaussian distribution, to define skill priors. This rigid assumption can restrict the diversity and flexibility of skills, particularly in complex, long-horizon tasks. In this work, we introduce a method that models potential primitive skill motions as having non-parametric properties with an unknown number of underlying features. We utilize a Bayesian non-parametric model, specifically Dirichlet Process Mixtures, enhanced with birth and merge heuristics, to pre-train a skill prior that effectively captures the diverse nature of skills. Additionally, the learned skills are explicitly trackable within the prior space, enhancing interpretability and control. By integrating this flexible skill prior into an RL framework, our approach surpasses existing methods in long-horizon manipulation tasks, enabling more efficient skill transfer and task success in complex environments. Our findings show that a richer, non-parametric representation of skill priors significantly improves both the learning and execution of challenging robotic tasks.

| **[Data-Agnostic Robotic Long-Horizon Manipulation with Vision-Language-Guided Closed-Loop Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21969v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in language-conditioned robotic manipulation have leveraged imitation and reinforcement learning to enable robots to execute tasks from human commands. However, these methods often suffer from limited generalization, adaptability, and the lack of large-scale specialized datasets, unlike data-rich domains such as computer vision, making long-horizon task execution challenging. To address these gaps, we introduce DAHLIA, a data-agnostic framework for language-conditioned long-horizon robotic manipulation, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for real-time task planning and execution. DAHLIA employs a dual-tunnel architecture, where an LLM-powered planner collaborates with co-planners to decompose tasks and generate executable plans, while a reporter LLM provides closed-loop feedback, enabling adaptive re-planning and ensuring task recovery from potential failures. Moreover, DAHLIA integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) in task reasoning and temporal abstraction for efficient action execution, enhancing traceability and robustness. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse long-horizon tasks, achieving strong generalization in both simulated and real-world scenarios.

Methods: For six months, surgical residents participated in three training sessions once a month, surrounding a single 26-hour hospital shift. In each shift, they participated in training sessions scheduled before, during, and after the shift. In each training session, they performed three dry-lab training tasks: Ring Tower Transfer, Knot-Tying, and Suturing. We collected a comprehensive dataset, including videos synchronized with kinematic data, activity tracking, and scans of the suturing pads. Results: We collected a dataset of 972 trials performed by 18 residents of different surgical specializations. Participants demonstrated consistent performance improvement across all tasks. In addition, we found variations in between-shift learning and forgetting across metrics and tasks, and hints for possible effects of fatigue. Conclusion: The findings from our first analysis shed light on the long-term learning processes of robotic surgical skills with extended intervals and varying levels of fatigue. Significance: This study lays the groundwork for future research aimed at optimizing training protocols and enhancing AI applications in surgery, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes. The dataset will be made available upon acceptance of our journal submission.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

For example, a household robot pretrained with a repertoire of skills must still adapt to unseen tasks specific to each household. Motivated by this, building upon parameter-efficient fine-tuning in language models, prior works have explored lightweight adapters to adapt pretrained policies, which can preserve learned features from the pretraining phase and demonstrate good adaptation performances. However, these approaches treat task learning separately, limiting knowledge transfer between tasks. In this paper, we propose Online Meta-Learned adapters (OMLA). Instead of applying adapters directly, OMLA can facilitate knowledge transfer from previously learned tasks to current learning tasks through a novel meta-learning objective. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that OMLA can lead to better adaptation performances compared to the baseline methods.

However, current methods struggle to model and solve these myriad constraints simultaneously. We propose a twofold solution: first, we model constraints as a family of manifolds amenable to simultaneous solving. Second, we introduce the constrained nonlinear Kaczmarz (cNKZ) projection technique to produce constraint-satisfying solutions. Experiments show that cNKZ dramatically outperforms baseline approaches, which cannot find solutions at all. We integrate cNKZ with a sampling-based motion planning algorithm to generate complex, coordinated motions for 3 to 6 mobile manipulators (18--36 DoF), with cNKZ solving up to 80 nonlinear constraints simultaneously and achieving up to a 92% success rate in cluttered environments. We also demonstrate our approach on hardware using three Turtlebot3 Waffle Pi robots with OpenMANIPULATOR-X arms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

The classical vector, homogeneous transformation matrices and dual quaternion approaches are studied for the kinematic functions using both classical differentiation and multidual algebra. The algorithms for inverse kinematics for all three studied formalisms are presented for both differentiation and multidual algebra approaches. Furthermore, these algorithms are compared based on numerical stability, execution times and number and type of mathematical functions and operators contained in each algorithm. A statistical analysis shows that there is significant improvement in execution time for the algorithms implemented using multidual algebra, while the numerical stability is appropriate for all algorithms derived based on differentiation and multidual algebra. While the implementation of the kinematic algorithms using multidual algebra shows positive results when benchmarked on a standard PC, further work is required to evaluate the multidual algorithms on hardware/software used for the modular parallel robot command and control.</p></details> |  |
| **[OminiAdapt: Learning Cross-Task Invariance for Robust and Environment-Aware Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21257v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of embodied intelligence, leveraging large-scale human data for high-level imitation learning on humanoid robots has become a focal point of interest in both academia and industry. However, applying humanoid robots to precision operation domains remains challenging due to the complexities they face in perception and control processes, the long-standing physical differences in morphology and actuation mechanisms between humanoid robots and humans, and the lack of task-relevant features obtained from egocentric vision. To address the issue of covariate shift in imitation learning, this paper proposes an imitation learning algorithm tailored for humanoid robots. By focusing on the primary task objectives, filtering out background information, and incorporating channel feature fusion with spatial attention mechanisms, the proposed algorithm suppresses environmental disturbances and utilizes a dynamic weight update strategy to significantly improve the success rate of humanoid robots in accomplishing target tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits robustness and scalability across various typical task scenarios, providing new ideas and approaches for autonomous learning and control in humanoid robots. The project will be open-sourced on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

AlphaSpace employs a hierarchical semantics-based tokenization strategy that encodes spatial information at both coarse and fine-grained levels. Our approach represents objects with their attributes, positions, and height information through structured tokens, enabling precise spatial reasoning without relying on traditional vision-based embeddings. This approach enables LLMs to accurately manipulate objects by positioning them at specific (x, y, z) coordinates. Experimental results suggest that AlphaSpace demonstrates promising potential for improving manipulation tasks, achieving a total accuracy of 66.67%, compared to 37.5% for GPT-4o and 29.17% for Claude 3.5 Sonnet. These results demonstrate the potential of structured spatial encoding for manipulation tasks and warrant further exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAGA: A Tangent-Based Reactive Approach for Socially Compliant Robot Navigation Around Human Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21168v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot navigation in densely populated environments presents significant challenges, particularly regarding the interplay between individual and group dynamics. Current navigation models predominantly address interactions with individual pedestrians while failing to account for human groups that naturally form in real-world settings. Conversely, the limited models implementing group-aware navigation typically prioritize group dynamics at the expense of individual interactions, both of which are essential for socially appropriate navigation. This research extends an existing simulation framework to incorporate both individual pedestrians and human groups. We present Tangent Action for Group Avoidance (TAGA), a modular reactive mechanism that can be integrated with existing navigation frameworks to enhance their group-awareness capabilities. TAGA dynamically modifies robot trajectories using tangent action-based avoidance strategies while preserving the underlying model's capacity to navigate around individuals. Additionally, we introduce Group Collision Rate (GCR), a novel metric to quantitatively assess how effectively robots maintain group integrity during navigation. Through comprehensive simulation-based benchmarking, we demonstrate that integrating TAGA with state-of-the-art navigation models (ORCA, Social Force, DS-RNN, and AG-RL) reduces group intrusions by 45.7-78.6% while maintaining comparable success rates and navigation efficiency. Future work will focus on real-world implementation and validation of this approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

However, ensuring the safety of human workers in dynamic, shared spaces remains a critical challenge. This work proposes a novel methodology that leverages control barrier functions (CBFs) to enhance safety in warehouse navigation. By integrating learning-based CBFs with the Open Robotics Middleware Framework (OpenRMF), the system achieves adaptive and safety-enhanced controls in multi-robot, multi-agent scenarios. Experiments conducted using various robot platforms demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in avoiding static and dynamic obstacles, including human pedestrians. Our experiments evaluate different scenarios in which the number of robots, robot platforms, speed, and number of obstacles are varied, from which we achieve promising performance.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in humanoid robots have shown great promise as a hardware platform for building generalist autonomy in the human world. A robot foundation model, trained on massive and diverse data sources, is essential for enabling the robots to reason about novel situations, robustly handle real-world variability, and rapidly learn new tasks. To this end, we introduce GR00T N1, an open foundation model for humanoid robots. GR00T N1 is a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a dual-system architecture. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The subsequent diffusion transformer module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Both modules are tightly coupled and jointly trained end-to-end. We train GR00T N1 with a heterogeneous mixture of real-robot trajectories, human videos, and synthetically generated datasets. We show that our generalist robot model GR00T N1 outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks across multiple robot embodiments. Furthermore, we deploy our model on the Fourier GR-1 humanoid robot for language-conditioned bimanual manipulation tasks, achieving strong performance with high data efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed alphabetically.

However, the AM of hyperelastic materials is still challenging with limited material types. Within this work, pellet-based 3D printing of very soft thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) was explored. Our results show that TPEs can have similar engineering stress and maximum strain as Ecoflex OO-10. These TPEs were used to 3D-print airtight thin membranes (0.2-1.2 mm), which could inflate up to a stretch of 1320\%. Combining the membrane's large expansion and softness with the 3D printing of hollow structures simplified the design of a bending actuator that can bend 180 degrees and reach a blocked force of 238 times its weight. In addition, by 3D printing TPE pellets and rigid filaments, the soft membrane could grasp objects by enveloping an object or as a sensorized sucker, which relied on the TPE's softness to conform to the object or act as a seal. In addition, the membrane of the sucker was utilized as a tactile sensor to detect an object before adhesion. These results suggest the feasibility of 3D printing soft robots by using soft TPEs and membranes as an interesting class of materials and sensorized actuators, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Using finite element analysis, we designed a 3D-printed gripper combining positive and negative pressure for secure yet compliant handling. Preliminary tests showed it exerted a lower, more uniform pressure profile than a standard rigid gripper. In a user study, participants' trust in robots significantly increased after they experienced a brief bathing demonstration performed by a robotic arm equipped with the soft gripper. These results suggest that soft robotics can enhance perceived safety and acceptance in intimate caregiving scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, many aerial manipulators feature bulky or heavy robot manipulators mounted to large, high-payload aerial vehicles. Instead, we propose an aerial robotic arm with low mass and a small stowed configuration called a "flying vine". The flying vine consists of a small, maneuverable quadrotor equipped with a soft, growing, inflated beam as the arm. This soft robot arm is underactuated, and positioning of the end effector is achieved by controlling the coupled quadrotor-vine dynamics. In this work, we present the flying vine design and a modeling and control framework for tracking desired end effector trajectories. The dynamic model leverages data-driven modeling methods and introduces bilinear interpolation to account for time-varying dynamic parameters. We use trajectory optimization to plan quadrotor controls that produce desired end effector motions. Experimental results on a physical prototype demonstrate that our framework enables the flying vine to perform high-speed end effector tracking, laying a foundation for performing dynamic maneuvers with soft aerial manipulators.</p></details> | Submitted to RA-L |
| **[Multi-Robot Coordination Under Physical Limitations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20723v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot coordination is fundamental to various applications, including autonomous exploration, search and rescue, and cooperative transportation. This paper presents an optimal consensus framework for multi-robot systems (MRSs) that ensures efficient rendezvous while minimizing energy consumption and addressing actuator constraints. A critical challenge in real-world deployments is actuator limitations, particularly wheel velocity saturation, which can significantly degrade control performance. To address this issue, we incorporate Pontryagin Minimum Principle (PMP) into the control design, facilitating constrained optimization while ensuring system stability and feasibility. The resulting optimal control policy effectively balances coordination efficiency and energy consumption, even in the presence of actuation constraints. The proposed framework is validated through extensive numerical simulations and real-world experiments conducted using a team of Robotarium mobile robots. The experimental results confirm that our control strategies achieve reliable and efficient coordinated rendezvous while addressing real-world challenges such as communication delays, sensor noise, and packet loss.</p></details> |  |

Force feedback has been proved to enhance the user experience in Extended Reality (XR) by providing contact-rich information. However, its impact on robot data collection has not received much attention in the robotics community. This paper addresses this shortcoming by conducting an extensive user study on the effects of force feedback during data collection in XR. We extended two XR-based robot control interfaces, Kinesthetic Teaching and Motion Controllers, with haptic feedback features. The user study is conducted using manipulation tasks ranging from simple pick-place to complex peg assemble, requiring precise operations. The evaluations show that force feedback enhances task performance and user experience, particularly in tasks requiring high-precision manipulation. These improvements vary depending on the robot control interface and task complexity. This paper provides new insights into how different factors influence the impact of force feedback.</p></details> |  |

A common practice is to first conduct simulation-based testing, which, despite reducing real-world risks, remains time-consuming and resource-intensive due to the vast space of possible test scenarios. A number of search-based approaches were proposed to generate test scenarios more efficiently. A key aspect of any search-based test generation approach is the choice of representation used during the search process. However, existing methods for improving test scenario representation remain limited. We propose RILaST (Representation Improvement in Latent Space for Search-Based Testing) approach, which enhances test representation by mapping it to the latent space of a variational autoencoder. We evaluate RILaST on two use cases, including autonomous drone and autonomous lane-keeping assist system. The obtained results show that RILaST allows finding between 3 to 4.6 times more failures than baseline approaches, achieving a high level of test diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning in Robotics via Adaptive Gradient-Masked Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20844v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for robotic control, but its realworld deployment remains challenging due to its vulnerability to environmental perturbations. Existing white-box adversarial attack methods, adapted from supervised learning, fail to effectively target DRL agents as they overlook temporal dynamics and indiscriminately perturb all state dimensions, limiting their impact on long-term rewards. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Gradient-Masked Reinforcement (AGMR) Attack, a white-box attack method that combines DRL with a gradient-based soft masking mechanism to dynamically identify critical state dimensions and optimize adversarial policies. AGMR selectively allocates perturbations to the most impactful state features and incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGMR outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods in degrading the performance of the victim agent and enhances the victim agent's robustness through adversarial defense mechanisms.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Powered by generative AI and advances in robotics, humanoid robots can speak and interact with humans rather naturally but are still easily recognizable as robots. But how will we treat humanoids when they seem indistinguishable from humans in appearance and mind? We find a tendency (called "anti-robot" speciesism) to deny such robots humanlike capabilities, driven by motivations to accord members of the human species preferential treatment. Six experiments show that robots are denied humanlike attributes, simply because they are not biological beings and because humans want to avoid feelings of cognitive dissonance when utilizing such robots for unsavory tasks. Thus, people do not rationally attribute capabilities to perfectly humanlike robots but deny them capabilities as it suits them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decremental Dynamics Planning for Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20521v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most, if not all, robot navigation systems employ a decomposed planning framework that includes global and local planning. To trade-off onboard computation and plan quality, current systems have to limit all robot dynamics considerations only within the local planner, while leveraging an extremely simplified robot representation (e.g., a point-mass holonomic model without dynamics) in the global level. However, such an artificial decomposition based on either full or zero consideration of robot dynamics can lead to gaps between the two levels, e.g., a global path based on a holonomic point-mass model may not be realizable by a non-holonomic robot, especially in highly constrained obstacle environments. Motivated by such a limitation, we propose a novel paradigm, Decremental Dynamics Planning that integrates dynamic constraints into the entire planning process, with a focus on high-fidelity dynamics modeling at the beginning and a gradual fidelity reduction as the planning progresses. To validate the effectiveness of this paradigm, we augment three different planners with DDP and show overall improved planning performance. We also develop a new DDP-based navigation system, which achieves first place in the simulation phase of the 2025 BARN Challenge. Both simulated and physical experiments validate DDP's hypothesized benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages. 2025 International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

However, the interplay between morphological and control complexities and their collective impact on task performance remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigate these trade-offs across tasks of differing difficulty levels using four well-used morphological complexity metrics and control complexity measured by FLOPs. We investigate how these factors jointly influence task performance by utilizing the evolutionary robot experiments. Results show that optimal performance depends on the alignment between morphology and control: simpler morphologies and lightweight controllers suffice for easier tasks, while harder tasks demand higher complexities in both dimensions. In addition, a clear trade-off between morphological and control complexities that achieve the same task performance can be observed. Moreover, we also propose a sensitivity analysis to expose the task-specific contributions of individual morphological metrics. Our study establishes a framework for investigating the relationships between morphology, control, and task performance, advancing the development of task-specific robotic designs that balance computational efficiency with adaptability. This study contributes to the practical application of soft robotics in real-world scenarios by providing actionable insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is planed to be submitted to a journal</p></details> |

Nevertheless, their real-world deployment is hindered by substantial computational and storage demands. Recent insights into the homogeneous patterns in the LLM layer have inspired sparsification techniques to address these challenges, such as early exit and token pruning. However, these methods often neglect the critical role of the final layers that encode the semantic information most relevant to downstream robotic tasks. Aligning with the recent breakthrough of the Shallow Brain Hypothesis (SBH) in neuroscience and the mixture of experts in model sparsification, we conceptualize each LLM layer as an expert and propose a Mixture-of-Layers Vision-Language-Action model (MoLe-VLA, or simply MoLe) architecture for dynamic LLM layer activation. We introduce a Spatial-Temporal Aware Router (STAR) for MoLe to selectively activate only parts of the layers based on the robot's current state, mimicking the brain's distinct signal pathways specialized for cognition and causal reasoning. Additionally, to compensate for the cognitive ability of LLMs lost in MoLe, we devise a Cognition Self-Knowledge Distillation (CogKD) framework. CogKD enhances the understanding of task demands and improves the generation of task-relevant action sequences by leveraging cognitive features. Extensive experiments conducted in both RLBench simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the superiority of MoLe-VLA in both efficiency and performance. Specifically, MoLe-VLA achieves an 8% improvement in the mean success rate across ten tasks while reducing computational costs by up to x5.6 compared to standard LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Recent diffusion-based methods show impressive performance in 3D robotic manipulation tasks, whereas they suffer from severe runtime inefficiency due to multiple denoising steps, especially with high-dimensional observations. To this end, we propose a real-time robotic manipulation model named ManiCM that imposes the consistency constraint to the diffusion process, so that the model can generate robot actions in only one-step inference. Specifically, we formulate a consistent diffusion process in the robot action space conditioned on the point cloud input, where the original action is required to be directly denoised from any point along the ODE trajectory. To model this process, we design a consistency distillation technique to predict the action sample directly instead of predicting the noise within the vision community for fast convergence in the low-dimensional action manifold. We evaluate ManiCM on 31 robotic manipulation tasks from Adroit and Metaworld, and the results demonstrate that our approach accelerates the state-of-the-art method by 10 times in average inference speed while maintaining competitive average success rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://manicm-fast.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Robot Programming: Mixed Reality Gripper Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02042v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional robot programming methods are complex and time-consuming for users. In recent years, alternative approaches such as mixed reality have been explored to address these challenges and optimize robot programming. While the findings of the mixed reality robot programming methods are convincing, most existing methods rely on gesture interaction for robot programming. Since controller-based interactions have proven to be more reliable, this paper examines three controller-based programming methods within a mixed reality scenario: 1) Classical Jogging, where the user positions the robot's end effector using the controller's thumbsticks, 2) Direct Control, where the controller's position and orientation directly corresponds to the end effector's, and 3) Gripper Control, where the controller is enhanced with a 3D-printed gripper attachment to grasp and release objects. A within-subjects study (n = 30) was conducted to compare these methods. The findings indicate that the Gripper Control condition outperforms the others in terms of task completion time, user experience, mental demand, and task performance, while also being the preferred method. Therefore, it demonstrates promising potential as an effective and efficient approach for future robot programming.

| **[RoboSpatial: Teaching Spatial Understanding to 2D and 3D Vision-Language Models for Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16537v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial understanding is a crucial capability that enables robots to perceive their surroundings, reason about their environment, and interact with it meaningfully. In modern robotics, these capabilities are increasingly provided by vision-language models. However, these models face significant challenges in spatial reasoning tasks, as their training data are based on general-purpose image datasets that often lack sophisticated spatial understanding. For example, datasets frequently do not capture reference frame comprehension, yet effective spatial reasoning requires understanding whether to reason from ego-, world-, or object-centric perspectives. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale dataset for spatial understanding in robotics. It consists of real indoor and tabletop scenes, captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, and annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5k 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, and the pairing of 2D egocentric images with 3D scans makes it both 2D- and 3D- ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robot manipulation.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[FoAM: Foresight-Augmented Multi-Task Imitation Policy for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19528v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task imitation learning (MTIL) has shown significant potential in robotic manipulation by enabling agents to perform various tasks using a single policy. This simplifies the policy deployment and enhances the agent's adaptability across different scenarios. However, key challenges remain, such as maintaining action reliability (e.g., avoiding abnormal action sequences that deviate from nominal task trajectories) and generalizing to unseen tasks with a few expert demonstrations. To address these challenges, we introduce the Foresight-Augmented Manipulation Policy (FoAM), a novel MTIL policy that pioneers the use of multi-modal goal condition as input and introduces a foresight augmentation in addition to the general action reconstruction. FoAM enables the agent to reason about the visual consequences (states) of its actions and learn more expressive embedding that captures nuanced task variations. Extensive experiments on over 100 tasks in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that FoAM significantly enhances MTIL policy performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by up to 41% in success rate. Meanwhile, we released our simulation suites, including a total of 10 scenarios and over 80 challenging tasks designed for manipulation policy training and evaluation.

Combined with Minkowski sum computations, shortest-path roadmaps can compute optimal paths for a translating robot in 2D. In this study, we explore the intuitive idea of stacking up a set of reduced visibility graphs at different orientations for a polygonal holonomic robot to support the fast computation of near-optimal paths, allowing simultaneous 2D translation and rotation. The resulting algorithm, rotation-stacked visibility graph (RVG), is shown to be resolution-complete and asymptotically optimal. Extensive computational experiments show RVG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-query sampling-based methods on both computation time and solution optimality fronts.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

This study investigates the impact of robot appearances (humanlike, mechanical) and face regions (full-face, eye-region) on human perception of robot emotions. A between-subjects user study (N = 305) was conducted where participants were asked to identify the emotions being displayed in videos of robot faces, as well as a human baseline. Our findings reveal three important insights for effective social robot face design in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI): Firstly, robots equipped with a back-projected, fully animated face - regardless of whether they are more human-like or more mechanical-looking - demonstrate a capacity for emotional expression comparable to that of humans. Secondly, the recognition accuracy of emotional expressions in both humans and robots declines when only the eye region is visible. Lastly, within the constraint of only the eye region being visible, robots with more human-like features significantly enhance emotion recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 16th International Conference on Social Robotics, Odense, Denmark (ICSR 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Autoregressive Action Sequence Learning for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03132v5)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing a universal policy architecture that performs well across diverse robots and task configurations remains a key challenge. In this work, we address this by representing robot actions as sequential data and generating actions through autoregressive sequence modeling. Existing autoregressive architectures generate end-effector waypoints sequentially as word tokens in language modeling, which are limited to low-frequency control tasks. Unlike language, robot actions are heterogeneous and often include continuous values -- such as joint positions, 2D pixel coordinates, and end-effector poses -- which are not easily suited for language-based modeling. Based on this insight, we introduce a straightforward enhancement: we extend causal transformers' single-token prediction to support predicting a variable number of tokens in a single step through our Chunking Causal Transformer (CCT). This enhancement enables robust performance across diverse tasks of various control frequencies, greater efficiency by having fewer autoregression steps, and lead to a hybrid action sequence design by mixing different types of actions and using a different chunk size for each action type. Based on CCT, we propose the Autoregressive Policy (ARP) architecture, which solves manipulation tasks by generating hybrid action sequences. We evaluate ARP across diverse robotic manipulation environments, including Push-T, ALOHA, and RLBench, and show that ARP, as a universal architecture, matches or outperforms the environment-specific state-of-the-art in all tested benchmarks, while being more efficient in computation and parameter sizes. Videos of our real robot demonstrations, all source code and the pretrained models of ARP can be found at http://github.com/mlzxy/arp.</p></details> | <details><summary>(RA-L...</summary><p>(RA-L 2025) Add a new figure to explain why chunking autoregression works.

This report introduces a new family of AI models purposefully designed for robotics and built upon the foundation of Gemini 2.0. We present Gemini Robotics, an advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) generalist model capable of directly controlling robots. Gemini Robotics executes smooth and reactive movements to tackle a wide range of complex manipulation tasks while also being robust to variations in object types and positions, handling unseen environments as well as following diverse, open vocabulary instructions. We show that with additional fine-tuning, Gemini Robotics can be specialized to new capabilities including solving long-horizon, highly dexterous tasks, learning new short-horizon tasks from as few as 100 demonstrations and adapting to completely novel robot embodiments. This is made possible because Gemini Robotics builds on top of the Gemini Robotics-ER model, the second model we introduce in this work. Gemini Robotics-ER (Embodied Reasoning) extends Gemini's multimodal reasoning capabilities into the physical world, with enhanced spatial and temporal understanding. This enables capabilities relevant to robotics including object detection, pointing, trajectory and grasp prediction, as well as multi-view correspondence and 3D bounding box predictions. We show how this novel combination can support a variety of robotics applications. We also discuss and address important safety considerations related to this new class of robotics foundation models. The Gemini Robotics family marks a substantial step towards developing general-purpose robots that realizes AI's potential in the physical world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visuo-Tactile Object Pose Estimation for a Multi-Finger Robot Hand with Low-Resolution In-Hand Tactile Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19893v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D pose estimation of grasped objects is an important prerequisite for robots to perform assembly or in-hand manipulation tasks, but object occlusion by the robot's own hand greatly increases the difficulty of this perceptual task. Here, we propose that combining visual information and proprioception with binary, low-resolution tactile contact measurements from across the interior surface of an articulated robotic hand can mitigate this issue. The visuo-tactile object-pose-estimation problem is formulated probabilistically in a factor graph. The pose of the object is optimized to align with the three kinds of measurements using a robust cost function to reduce the influence of visual or tactile outlier readings. The advantages of the proposed approach are first demonstrated in simulation: a custom 15-DoF robot hand with one binary tactile sensor per link grasps 17 YCB objects while observed by an RGB-D camera. This low-resolution in-hand tactile sensing significantly improves object-pose estimates under high occlusion and also high visual noise. We also show these benefits through grasping tests with a preliminary real version of our tactile hand, obtaining reasonable visuo-tactile estimates of object pose at approximately 13.3 Hz on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2025</p></details> |

However, the limited battery life of robots remains a significant obstacle to their effective adoption in real-world exploration scenarios. This paper explores, via field experiments, the potential energy-saving gains of OROS, a joint orchestration of 5G and Robot Operating System (ROS) that coordinates multiple 5G-connected robots both in terms of navigation and sensing, as well as optimizes their cloud-native service resource utilization while minimizing total resource and energy consumption on the robots based on real-time feedback. We designed, implemented and evaluated our proposed OROS in an experimental testbed composed of commercial off-the-shelf robots and a local 5G infrastructure deployed on a campus. The experimental results demonstrated that OROS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of energy savings by offloading demanding computational tasks to the 5G edge infrastructure and dynamic energy management of on-board sensors (e.g., switching them off when they are not needed). This strategy achieves approximately 15% energy savings on the robots, thereby extending battery life, which in turn allows for longer operating times and better resource utilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 figures, journal</p></details> |

However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the DataPlatter method, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.</p></details> |  |

Despite progress with current methods, challenges persist in fusing depth and RGB information within 3D environments and executing tasks guided by linguistic instructions. In response to these challenges, we have enhanced the existing RoboFlamingo framework by introducing RoboFlamingo-Plus, which incorporates depth data into VLMs to significantly improve robotic manipulation performance. Our research achieves a nuanced fusion of RGB and depth information by integrating a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) with a resampling technique, closely aligning this combined data with linguistic cues for superior multimodal understanding. The novelty of RoboFlamingo-Plus lies in its adaptation of inputs for depth data processing, leveraging a pre-trained resampler for depth feature extraction, and employing cross-attention mechanisms for optimal feature integration. These improvements allow RoboFlamingo-Plus to not only deeply understand 3D environments but also easily perform complex, language-guided tasks in challenging settings. Experimental results show that RoboFlamingo-Plus boosts robotic manipulation by 10-20% over current methods, marking a significant advancement. Codes and model weights are public at RoboFlamingo-Plus.</p></details> |  |

This results in limited generalization to new tasks and difficulties in pinpointing errors within long-horizon, multi-stage tasks. To address this, we propose RoboMatrix, a skill-centric hierarchical framework designed for scalable robot task planning and execution in open-world environments. RoboMatrix extracts general meta-skills from diverse complex tasks, enabling the completion of unseen tasks through skill composition. Its architecture consists of a high-level scheduling layer that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for task decomposition, an intermediate skill layer housing meta-skill models, and a low-level hardware layer for robot control. A key innovation of our work is the introduction of the first unified vision-language-action (VLA) model capable of seamlessly integrating both movement and manipulation within one model. This is achieved by combining vision and language prompts to generate discrete actions. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboMatrix achieves a 50% higher success rate than task-centric baselines when applied to unseen objects, scenes, and tasks. To advance open-world robotics research, we will open-source code, hardware designs, model weights, and datasets at https://github.com/WayneMao/RoboMatrix.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Quality-focused Active Adversarial Policy for Safe Grasping in Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19397v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-guided robot grasping methods based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in handling unknown objects, attributable to their powerful generalizability. However, these methods with this generalizability tend to recognize the human hand and its adjacent objects as graspable targets, compromising safety during Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). In this work, we propose the Quality-focused Active Adversarial Policy (QFAAP) to solve this problem. Specifically, the first part is the Adversarial Quality Patch (AQP), wherein we design the adversarial quality patch loss and leverage the grasp dataset to optimize a patch with high quality scores. Next, we construct the Projected Quality Gradient Descent (PQGD) and integrate it with the AQP, which contains only the hand region within each real-time frame, endowing the AQP with fast adaptability to the human hand shape. Through AQP and PQGD, the hand can be actively adversarial with the surrounding objects, lowering their quality scores. Therefore, further setting the quality score of the hand to zero will reduce the grasping priority of both the hand and its adjacent objects, enabling the robot to grasp other objects away from the hand without emergency stops. We conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets and a cobot, showing the effectiveness of QFAAP. Our code and demo videos are available here: https://github.com/clee-jaist/QFAAP.</p></details> |  |

However, imaging organs with large tissue movements, such as those caused by respiration, presents substantial challenges. Existing methods often require breath holding to maintain accumulation accuracy, which limits data acquisition time and ULM image saturation. To improve image quality in the presence of large tissue movements, this study introduces an approach integrating high-frame-rate ultrasound with online precise robotic probe control. Tested on a microvasculature phantom with translation motions up to 20 mm, twice the aperture size of the matrix array used, our method achieved real-time tracking of the moving phantom and imaging volume rate at 85 Hz, keeping majority of the target volume in the imaging field of view. ULM images of the moving cross channels in the phantom were successfully reconstructed in post-processing, demonstrating the feasibility of super-resolution imaging under large tissue motions. This represents a significant step towards ULM imaging of organs with large motion.</p></details> |  |

However, their application in robotic scenarios, particularly for long-horizon manipulation tasks, reveals significant limitations. These limitations arise from the current MLLMs lacking three essential robotic brain capabilities: Planning Capability, which involves decomposing complex manipulation instructions into manageable sub-tasks; Affordance Perception, the ability to recognize and interpret the affordances of interactive objects; and Trajectory Prediction, the foresight to anticipate the complete manipulation trajectory necessary for successful execution. To enhance the robotic brain's core capabilities from abstract to concrete, we introduce ShareRobot, a high-quality heterogeneous dataset that labels multi-dimensional information such as task planning, object affordance, and end-effector trajectory. ShareRobot's diversity and accuracy have been meticulously refined by three human annotators. Building on this dataset, we developed RoboBrain, an MLLM-based model that combines robotic and general multi-modal data, utilizes a multi-stage training strategy, and incorporates long videos and high-resolution images to improve its robotic manipulation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance across various robotic tasks, highlighting its potential to advance robotic brain capabilities.</p></details> |  |

These are intrinsic properties of the robot's morphology, frequently observed in animal biology and robotics, which stem from the replication of kinematic structures and the symmetrical distribution of mass. We illustrate how these symmetries extend to the robot's state space and both proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensor measurements, resulting in the equivariance of the robot's equations of motion and optimal control policies. Thus, we recognize morphological symmetries as a relevant and previously unexplored physics-informed geometric prior, with significant implications for both data-driven and analytical methods used in modeling, control, estimation and design in robotics. For data-driven methods, we demonstrate that morphological symmetries can enhance the sample efficiency and generalization of machine learning models through data augmentation, or by applying equivariant/invariant constraints on the model's architecture. In the context of analytical methods, we employ abstract harmonic analysis to decompose the robot's dynamics into a superposition of lower-dimensional, independent dynamics. We substantiate our claims with both synthetic and real-world experiments conducted on bipedal and quadrupedal robots. Lastly, we introduce the repository MorphoSymm to facilitate the practical use of the theory and applications outlined in this work.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Autonomous Generation of Sub-goals for Lifelong Learning in Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18914v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the challenges of open-ended learning in robots is the need to autonomously discover goals and learn skills to achieve them. However, when in lifelong learning settings, it is always desirable to generate sub-goals with their associated skills, without relying on explicit reward, as steppingstones to a goal. This allows sub-goals and skills to be reused to facilitate achieving other goals. This work proposes a two-pronged approach for sub-goal generation to address this challenge: a top-down approach, where sub-goals are hierarchically derived from general goals using intrinsic motivations to discover them, and a bottom-up approach, where sub-goal chains emerge from making latent relationships between goals and perceptual classes that were previously learned in different domains explicit. These methods help the robot to autonomously generate and chain sub-goals as a way to achieve more general goals. Additionally, they create more abstract representations of goals, helping to reduce sub-goal duplication and make the learning of skills more efficient. Implemented within an existing cognitive architecture for lifelong open-ended learning and tested with a real robot, our approach enhances the robot's ability to discover and achieve goals, generate sub-goals in an efficient manner, generalize learned skills, and operate in dynamic and unknown environments without explicit intermediate rewards.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Robots possess offensive or defensive capabilities to interfere and weaken their opponents to take over a competing site. This problem belongs to the conventional Colonel Blotto Game. Considering the robots' heterogeneous capabilities and environmental factors, we generalize the conventional Blotto game by incorporating heterogeneous robot types and graph constraints that capture the robot transitions between sites. Then we employ the Double Oracle Algorithm (DOA) to solve for the Nash equilibrium of the generalized Blotto game. Particularly, for cyclic-dominance-heterogeneous (CDH) robots that inhibit each other, we define a new transformation rule between any two robot types. Building on the transformation, we design a novel utility function to measure the game's outcome quantitatively. Moreover, we rigorously prove the correctness of the designed utility function. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of DOA on computing Nash equilibrium for homogeneous, linear heterogeneous, and CDH robot allocation on graphs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are often limited by prerequisites such as camera calibration or the need for controlled environments (e.g., green screen setups). In this work, we introduce RoboEngine, the first plug-and-play visual robot data augmentation toolkit. For the first time, users can effortlessly generate physics- and task-aware robot scenes with just a few lines of code. To achieve this, we present a novel robot scene segmentation dataset, a generalizable high-quality robot segmentation model, and a fine-tuned background generation model, which together form the core components of the out-of-the-box toolkit. Using RoboEngine, we demonstrate the ability to generalize robot manipulation tasks across six entirely new scenes, based solely on demonstrations collected from a single scene, achieving a more than 200% performance improvement compared to the no-augmentation baseline. All datasets, model weights, and the toolkit will be publicly released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://roboengine.github.io/</p></details> |

Centralized control policies do not scale with increasing numbers of robots, whereas independent control policies do not exploit the information provided by other robots, exhibiting poor performance in cooperative-competitive tasks. In this work we propose a physics-informed reinforcement learning approach able to learn distributed multi-robot control policies that are both scalable and make use of all the available information to each robot. Our approach has three key characteristics. First, it imposes a port-Hamiltonian structure on the policy representation, respecting energy conservation properties of physical robot systems and the networked nature of robot team interactions. Second, it uses self-attention to ensure a sparse policy representation able to handle time-varying information at each robot from the interaction graph. Third, we present a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm parameterized by our self-attention port-Hamiltonian control policy, which accounts for the correlation among robots during training while overcoming the need of value function factorization. Extensive simulations in different multi-robot scenarios demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, surpassing previous multi-robot reinforcement learning solutions in scalability, while achieving similar or superior performance (with averaged cumulative reward up to x2 greater than the state-of-the-art with robot teams x6 larger than the number of robots at training time). We also validate our approach on multiple real robots in the Georgia Tech Robotarium under imperfect communication, demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and scalability across number of robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review at IEEE T-RO</p></details> |
| **[FF-SRL: High Performance GPU-Based Surgical Simulation For Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18616v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic surgery is a rapidly developing field that can greatly benefit from the automation of surgical tasks. However, training techniques such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) require a high number of task repetitions, which are generally unsafe and impractical to perform on real surgical systems. This stresses the need for simulated surgical environments, which are not only realistic, but also computationally efficient and scalable. We introduce FF-SRL (Fast and Flexible Surgical Reinforcement Learning), a high-performance learning environment for robotic surgery. In FF-SRL both physics simulation and RL policy training reside entirely on a single GPU. This avoids typical bottlenecks associated with data transfer between the CPU and GPU, leading to accelerated learning rates. Our results show that FF-SRL reduces the training time of a complex tissue manipulation task by an order of magnitude, down to a couple of minutes, compared to a common CPU/GPU simulator. Such speed-up may facilitate the experimentation with RL techniques and contribute to the development of new generation of surgical systems. To this end, we make our code publicly available to the community.</p></details> |  |

Thus, a planning for a deployment is required, before sending the robots. The obstacles, the limited communication range, and the need of communicating to a base station, constrain the connectivity of the team and the deployment planning. We propose a method consisting of three algorithms: a distributed path planner to obtain communication-aware trajectories; a deployment planner providing dual-use of the robots, visiting primary goals and performing connectivity tasks; and a clustering algorithm to allocate the tasks to robots, and obtain the best goal visit order for the mission.</p></details> |  |

When a robot lacks the necessary tools to accomplish a task requested by a human, it autonomously designs the required instruments and learns how to use them to achieve the goal. Evolution 6.0 is an autonomous robotic system powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Vision-Language Action (VLA) models, and Text-to-3D generative models for tool design and task execution. The system comprises two key modules: the Tool Generation Module, which fabricates task-specific tools from visual and textual data, and the Action Generation Module, which converts natural language instructions into robotic actions. It integrates QwenVLM for environmental understanding, OpenVLA for task execution, and Llama-Mesh for 3D tool generation. Evaluation results demonstrate a 90% success rate for tool generation with a 10-second inference time, and action generation achieving 83.5% in physical and visual generalization, 70% in motion generalization, and 37% in semantic generalization. Future improvements will focus on bimanual manipulation, expanded task capabilities, and enhanced environmental interpretation to improve real-world adaptability.</p></details> | Submitted to IROS |
| **[Improving robot navigation in crowded environments using intrinsic rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06554v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous navigation in crowded environments is an open problem with many applications, essential for the coexistence of robots and humans in the smart cities of the future. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning approaches have proven to outperform model-based algorithms. Nevertheless, even though the results provided are promising, the works are not able to take advantage of the capabilities that their models offer. They usually get trapped in local optima in the training process, that prevent them from learning the optimal policy. They are not able to visit and interact with every possible state appropriately, such as with the states near the goal or near the dynamic obstacles. In this work, we propose using intrinsic rewards to balance between exploration and exploitation and explore depending on the uncertainty of the states instead of on the time the agent has been trained, encouraging the agent to get more curious about unknown states. We explain the benefits of the approach and compare it with other exploration algorithms that may be used for crowd navigation. Many simulation experiments are performed modifying several algorithms of the state-of-the-art, showing that the use of intrinsic rewards makes the robot learn faster and reach higher rewards and success rates (fewer collisions) in shorter navigation times, outperforming the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

However, it has fundamental limitations in out-of-distribution failures that persist due to compounding errors and its limited capability to extrapolate. One way to address these limitations is robot-gated DAgger, an interactive imitation learning with a robot query system to actively seek expert help during policy rollout. While robot-gated DAgger has high potential for learning at scale, existing methods like Ensemble-DAgger struggle with highly expressive policies: They often misinterpret policy disagreements as uncertainty at multi-modal decision points. To address this problem, we introduce Diff-DAgger, an efficient robot-gated DAgger algorithm that leverages the training objective of diffusion policy. We evaluate Diff-DAgger across different robot tasks including stacking, pushing, and plugging, and show that Diff-DAgger improves the task failure prediction by 39.0%, the task completion rate by 20.6%, and reduces the wall-clock time by a factor of 7.8. We hope that this work opens up a path for efficiently incorporating expressive yet data-hungry policies into interactive robot learning settings.

We introduce an innovative multimodal odometry approach using inputs from GPR, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a wheel encoder. To efficiently address GPR signal noise, we introduce an advanced feature representation called the subsurface feature matrix (SFM). The SFM leverages frequency domain data and identifies peaks within radar scans. Additionally, we propose a novel feature matching method that estimates GPR displacement by aligning SFMs. The integrations from these three input sources are consolidated using a factor graph approach to achieve multimodal robot odometry. Our method has been developed and evaluated with the CMU-GPR public dataset, demonstrating improvements in accuracy and robustness with real-time performance in robotic odometry tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional fixed-view camera systems face challenges adapting to change viewpoints and scale variations, limiting perception and manipulation precision. To tackle these issues, we propose the Active Vision-driven Robotic (AVR) framework, a teleoperation hardware solution that supports dynamic viewpoint and dynamic focal length adjustments to continuously center targets and maintain optimal scale, accompanied by a corresponding algorithm that effectively enhances the success rates of various operational tasks. Using the RoboTwin platform with a real-time image processing plugin, AVR framework improves task success rates by 5%-16% on five manipulation tasks. Physical deployment on a dual-arm system demonstrates in collaborative tasks and 36% precision in screwdriver insertion, outperforming baselines by over 25%.

However, these approaches pretrain only on 2D images, while many robotics applications require 3D scene understanding. In this work, we propose 3D-MVP, a novel approach for 3D Multi-View Pretraining using masked autoencoders. We leverage Robotic View Transformer (RVT), which uses a multi-view transformer to understand the 3D scene and predict gripper pose actions. We split RVT's multi-view transformer into visual encoder and action decoder, and pretrain its visual encoder using masked autoencoding on large-scale 3D datasets such as Objaverse. We evaluate 3D-MVP on a suite of virtual robot manipulation tasks and demonstrate improved performance over baselines. Our results suggest that 3D-aware pretraining is a promising approach to improve generalization of vision-based robotic manipulation policies.

In this study, we explore how regular interactions with a social robot, conducted in a structured yet familiar environment within university halls and departments, can provide effective support for emotion regulation through cognitive reappraisal. Twenty-one students participated in a five-session study at a university hall or department, where the robot facilitated structured conversations, encouraging the students to reinterpret emotionally charged situations that they shared with the robot. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate significant improvements in emotion self-regulation, with participants reporting better understanding and control of their emotions. The intervention led to significant changes in constructive emotion regulation tendencies and positive effects on mood and sentiment after each session. The findings also demonstrate that repeated interactions with the robot encouraged greater emotional expressiveness, including longer speech disclosures, increased use of affective language, and heightened facial arousal. Notably, expressiveness followed structured patterns aligned with the reappraisal process, with expression peaking during key reappraisal moments, particularly when participants were prompted to reinterpret negative experiences. The qualitative feedback further highlighted how the robot fostered introspection and provided a supportive space for discussing emotions, enabling participants to confront long-avoided emotional challenges. These findings demonstrate the potential of robots to effectively assist in emotion regulation in familiar environments, offering both emotional support and cognitive guidance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decentralized Navigation of a Cable-Towed Load using Quadrupedal Robot Team via MARL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18221v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the challenge of enabling a team of quadrupedal robots to collaboratively tow a cable-connected load through cluttered and unstructured environments while avoiding obstacles. Leveraging cables allows the multi-robot system to navigate narrow spaces by maintaining slack when necessary. However, this introduces hybrid physical interactions due to alternating taut and slack states, with computational complexity that scales exponentially as the number of agents increases. To tackle these challenges, we developed a scalable and decentralized system capable of dynamically coordinating a variable number of quadrupedal robots while managing the hybrid physical interactions inherent in the load-towing task. At the core of this system is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based planner, designed for decentralized coordination. The MARL-based planner is trained using a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework, enabling each robot to make decisions autonomously using only local (ego) observations. To accelerate learning and ensure effective collaboration across varying team sizes, we introduce a tailored training curriculum for MARL. Experimental results highlight the flexibility and scalability of the framework, demonstrating successful deployment with one to four robots in real-world scenarios and up to twelve robots in simulation. The decentralized planner maintains consistent inference times, regardless of the team size. Additionally, the proposed system demonstrates robustness to environment perturbations and adaptability to varying load weights. This work represents a step forward in achieving flexible and efficient multi-legged robotic collaboration in complex and real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Socially-Aware Robot Navigation Enhanced by Bidirectional Natural Language Conversations Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04965v2)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot navigation is crucial across various domains, yet traditional methods focus on efficiency and obstacle avoidance, often overlooking human behavior in shared spaces. With the rise of service robots, socially aware navigation has gained prominence. However, existing approaches primarily predict pedestrian movements or issue alerts, lacking true human-robot interaction. We introduce Hybrid Soft Actor-Critic with Large Language Model (HSAC-LLM), a novel framework for socially aware navigation. By integrating deep reinforcement learning with large language models, HSAC-LLM enables bidirectional natural language interactions, predicting both continuous and discrete navigation actions. When potential collisions arise, the robot proactively communicates with pedestrians to determine avoidance strategies. Experiments in 2D simulation, Gazebo, and real-world environments demonstrate that HSAC-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DRL methods in interaction, navigation, and obstacle avoidance. This paradigm advances effective human-robot interactions in dynamic settings. Videos are available at https://hsacllm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Data-Centric Revisit of Pre-Trained Vision Models for Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06960v2)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision models (PVMs) are fundamental to modern robotics, yet their optimal configuration remains unclear. Through systematic evaluation, we find that while DINO and iBOT outperform MAE across visuomotor control and perception tasks, they struggle when trained on non-(single-)object-centric (NOC) data--a limitation strongly correlated with their diminished ability to learn object-centric representations. This investigation indicates that the ability to form object-centric representations from the non-object-centric robotics dataset is the key to success for PVMs. Motivated by this discovery, we designed SlotMIM, a method that induces object-centric representations by introducing a semantic bottleneck to reduce the number of prototypes to encourage the emergence of objectness as well as cross-view consistency regularization for encouraging multiview invariance. Our experiments encompass pre-training on object-centric, scene-centric, web-crawled, and ego-centric data. Across all settings, our approach learns transferrable representations and achieves significant improvements over prior work in image recognition, scene understanding, and robot learning evaluations. When scaled up with million-scale datasets, our method also demonstrates superior data efficiency and scalability. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/SlotMIM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

This motivates our present work where we developed a data-driven model predictive controller (MPC) based on the Koopman operator framework, allowing the embedding of nonlinear dynamics in a higher dimensional, but linear function space. The controller, termed adaptive Koopman model predictive control (KMPC), uses online closed-loop feedback to learn and incrementally update a linear representation of nonlinear system dynamics, without the prior knowledge of a model. Adaptive KMPC differs from most other Koopman-based control frameworks that aim to identify high-validity-range models in advance and then enter closed-loop control without further model adaptations. To validate the controller, trajectory tracking experiments are conducted with 1R and 2R robots under force disturbances and changing model parameters. We compare the controller to classical linearization MPC and Koopman-based MPC without model updates, denoted static KMPC. The results show that adaptive KMPC can, opposed to static KMPC, generalize over unforeseen force disturbances and can, opposed to linearization MPC, handle varying dynamic parameters, while using a small set of basis functions to approximate the Koopman operator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to IROS 2025; See supplementary material at https://github.com/adrianodelr/adaptive-koopman-mpc</p></details> |

However, 3DGS-based methods in robotics primarily focus on static scenes, with limited attention to the dynamic scene changes essential for long-term service robots. These robots demand sustained task execution and efficient scene updates-challenges current approaches fail to meet. To address these limitations, we propose GS-LTS (Gaussian Splatting for Long-Term Service), a 3DGS-based system enabling indoor robots to manage diverse tasks in dynamic environments over time. GS-LTS detects scene changes (e.g., object addition or removal) via single-image change detection, employs a rule-based policy to autonomously collect multi-view observations, and efficiently updates the scene representation through Gaussian editing. Additionally, we propose a simulation-based benchmark that automatically generates scene change data as compact configuration scripts, providing a standardized, user-friendly evaluation benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate GS-LTS's advantages in reconstruction, navigation, and superior scene updates-faster and higher quality than the image training baseline-advancing 3DGS for long-term robotic operations.

However, most existing perching methods adopt either an upward or downward approach, making it difficult to perch near walls with surrounding obstacles. Additionally, perching hands are typically designed solely for attachment to objects and lack additional functionality, imposing a payload burden during flight. To address these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight robotic hand, the "Tri-force hand", capable of both perching and object grasping, as well as a new perching method called "Pendulum-perching". The Tri-force hand is a tendon-driven, three-fingered hand utilizing a spherical joint and a two-dimensional differential plate, enabling passive actuation with a single actuator. Each finger module, designed with controllable semi-tendon drive, can conform to arbitrary shapes within its operating range, allowing both perching and adaptive object grasping. By integrating this hand into a fully actuated aerial robot, the system can perform multi-directional approaches from the side and landing using gravity. This approach is similar to Crush-perching seen in researches with fixed-wing aerial robots, but it differs in its superior control over approach speed and direction, as well as its ability to achieve stable detachment and re-launch. In experiments, the fabricated Tri-force hand demonstrated the ability to withstand a total weight of up to 27.5 kg, grasp various objects ranging from simple to complex-shaped tools, and achieve a high success rate in both perching and takeoff.</p></details> |  |

Traditional model-based and data-driven techniques lack adaptability, while more flexible generative AI methods struggle with grounding extracted information to real-world constraints. We introduce RAIDER, a novel agent that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with grounded tools for adaptable and efficient issue detection and explanation. Using a unique "Ground, Ask& Answer, Issue" procedure, RAIDER dynamically generates context-aware precondition questions and selects appropriate tools for resolution, achieving targeted information gathering. Our results within a simulated household environment surpass methods relying on predefined models, full scene descriptions, or standalone trained models. Additionally, RAIDER's explanations enhance recovery success, including cases requiring human interaction. Its modular architecture, featuring self-correction mechanisms, enables straightforward adaptation to diverse scenarios, as demonstrated in a real-world human-assistive task. This showcases RAIDER's potential as a versatile agentic AI solution for robotic issue detection and explanation, while addressing the problem of grounding generative AI for its effective application in embodied agents.

| **[Transferable Latent-to-Latent Locomotion Policy for Efficient and Versatile Motion Control of Diverse Legged Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17626v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable capability in acquiring robot skills, but learning each new skill still requires substantial data collection for training. The pretrain-and-finetune paradigm offers a promising approach for efficiently adapting to new robot entities and tasks. Inspired by the idea that acquired knowledge can accelerate learning new tasks with the same robot and help a new robot master a trained task, we propose a latent training framework where a transferable latent-to-latent locomotion policy is pretrained alongside diverse task-specific observation encoders and action decoders. This policy in latent space processes encoded latent observations to generate latent actions to be decoded, with the potential to learn general abstract motion skills. To retain essential information for decision-making and control, we introduce a diffusion recovery module that minimizes information reconstruction loss during pretrain stage. During fine-tune stage, the pretrained latent-to-latent locomotion policy remains fixed, while only the lightweight task-specific encoder and decoder are optimized for efficient adaptation. Our method allows a robot to leverage its own prior experience across different tasks as well as the experience of other morphologically diverse robots to accelerate adaptation. We validate our approach through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating that the pretrained latent-to-latent locomotion policy effectively generalizes to new robot entities and tasks with improved efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While existing work has largely focused on emotion recognition and static response systems, many approaches rely on sentiment analysis and action mapping frameworks that are pre-defined with limited dimensionality and fixed configurations, lacking the flexibility of dynamic personality traits and memory-enabled adaptation. Other systems are often restricted to limited modes of expression and fail to develop a causal relationship between human behavior and the robot's proactive physical actions, resulting in constrained adaptability and reduced responsiveness in complex, dynamic interactions. Our methodology integrates the Big Five Personality Traits, Appraisal Theory, and abstracted memory layers through Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates a parameterized robot personality based on the Big Five, processes human language and sentiments, evaluates human behavior using Appraisal Theory, and generates emotions and selects appropriate actions adapted by historical context over time. We validated the framework by testing three robots with distinct personalities in identical background contexts and found that personality, appraisal, and memory influence the adaptability of human-robot interactions. The impact of the individual components was further validated through ablation tests. We conclude that this system enables robots to engage in meaningful and personalized interactions with users, and holds significant potential for applications in domains such as pet robots, assistive robots, educational robots, and collaborative functional robots, where cultivating tailored relationships and enriching user experiences are essential.</p></details> |  |

These `microTac' tactile sensors are miniature versions of the TacTip vision-based tactile sensor, and can extract precise contact geometry and force information at each fingertip for use as feedback into a controller to modulate the grasp while a held object is manipulated. Using a parallel processing pipeline, we asynchronously capture tactile images and predict contact pose and force from multiple tactile sensors. Consistent pose and force models across all sensors are developed using supervised deep learning with transfer learning techniques. We then develop a grasp control framework that uses contact force feedback from all fingertip sensors simultaneously, allowing the hand to safely handle delicate objects even under external disturbances. This control framework is applied to several grasp-manipulation experiments: first, retaining a flexible cup in a grasp without crushing it under changes in object weight; second, a pouring task where the center of mass of the cup changes dynamically; and third, a tactile-driven leader-follower task where a human guides a held object. These manipulation tasks demonstrate more human-like dexterity with underactuated robotic hands by using fast reflexive control from tactile sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages. 10 figures.

In this work, we consider agents with a limited field of view, viewing range, and ability to miss objects within the viewing range (e.g., transparency). By considering the observation model independently from the motion policy, we can better predict the agent's behavior by considering these limitations and approximating them. We perform a user study where human operators navigate a cluttered scene while scanning the region for obstacles with a limited field of view and range. Using imitation learning, we show that a robot can adopt a human's strategy for observing an environment with limitations on observation and navigate with minimal collision with dynamic and static obstacles. We also show that this learned model helps it successfully navigate a physical hardware vehicle in real-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM+MAP: Bimanual Robot Task Planning using Large Language Models and Planning Domain Definition Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17309v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bimanual robotic manipulation provides significant versatility, but also presents an inherent challenge due to the complexity involved in the spatial and temporal coordination between two hands. Existing works predominantly focus on attaining human-level manipulation skills for robotic hands, yet little attention has been paid to task planning on long-horizon timescales. With their outstanding in-context learning and zero-shot generation abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied and grounded in diverse robotic embodiments to facilitate task planning. However, LLMs still suffer from errors in long-horizon reasoning and from hallucinations in complex robotic tasks, lacking a guarantee of logical correctness when generating the plan. Previous works, such as LLM+P, extended LLMs with symbolic planners. However, none have been successfully applied to bimanual robots. New challenges inevitably arise in bimanual manipulation, necessitating not only effective task decomposition but also efficient task allocation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LLM+MAP, a bimanual planning framework that integrates LLM reasoning and multi-agent planning, automating effective and efficient bimanual task planning. We conduct simulated experiments on various long-horizon manipulation tasks of differing complexity. Our method is built using GPT-4o as the backend, and we compare its performance against plans generated directly by LLMs, including GPT-4o, V3 and also recent strong reasoning models o1 and R1. By analyzing metrics such as planning time, success rate, group debits, and planning-step reduction rate, we demonstrate the superior performance of LLM+MAP, while also providing insights into robotic reasoning.

Equipping robots with the ability to understand social touch adds another modality in which humans and robots can communicate. In this paper, we present a social gesture recognition system using a fabric-based, large-scale tactile sensor placed onto the arms of a humanoid robot. We built a social gesture dataset using multiple participants and extracted temporal features for classification. By collecting tactile data on a humanoid robot, our system provides insights into human-robot social touch, and displays that the use of fabric based sensors could be a potential way of advancing the development of spHRI systems for more natural and effective communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 25. 8 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Discrete Policy: Learning Disentangled Action Space for Multi-Task Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18707v4)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning visuomotor policy for multi-task robotic manipulation has been a long-standing challenge for the robotics community. The difficulty lies in the diversity of action space: typically, a goal can be accomplished in multiple ways, resulting in a multimodal action distribution for a single task. The complexity of action distribution escalates as the number of tasks increases. In this work, we propose \textbf{Discrete Policy}, a robot learning method for training universal agents capable of multi-task manipulation skills. Discrete Policy employs vector quantization to map action sequences into a discrete latent space, facilitating the learning of task-specific codes. These codes are then reconstructed into the action space conditioned on observations and language instruction. We evaluate our method on both simulation and multiple real-world embodiments, including both single-arm and bimanual robot settings. We demonstrate that our proposed Discrete Policy outperforms a well-established Diffusion Policy baseline and many state-of-the-art approaches, including ACT, Octo, and OpenVLA. For example, in a real-world multi-task training setting with five tasks, Discrete Policy achieves an average success rate that is 26\% higher than Diffusion Policy and 15\% higher than OpenVLA. As the number of tasks increases to 12, the performance gap between Discrete Policy and Diffusion Policy widens to 32.5\%, further showcasing the advantages of our approach. Our work empirically demonstrates that learning multi-task policies within the latent space is a vital step toward achieving general-purpose agents.</p></details> | Accept to ICRA 2025 |
| **[Control the Soft Robot Arm with its Physical Twin](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17227v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To exploit the compliant capabilities of soft robot arms we require controller which can exploit their physical capabilities. Teleoperation, leveraging a human in the loop, is a key step towards achieving more complex control strategies. Whilst teleoperation is widely used for rigid robots, for soft robots we require teleoperation methods where the configuration of the whole body is considered. We propose a method of using an identical 'physical twin', or demonstrator of the robot. This tendon robot can be back-driven, with the tendon lengths providing configuration perception, and enabling a direct mapping of tendon lengths for the execture. We demonstrate how this teleoperation across the entire configuration of the robot enables complex interactions with exploit the envrionment, such as squeezing into gaps. We also show how this method can generalize to robots which are a larger scale that the physical twin, and how, tuneability of the stiffness properties of the physical twin simplify its use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code-as-Monitor: Constraint-aware Visual Programming for Reactive and Proactive Robotic Failure Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04455v3)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic detection and prevention of open-set failures are crucial in closed-loop robotic systems. Recent studies often struggle to simultaneously identify unexpected failures reactively after they occur and prevent foreseeable ones proactively. To this end, we propose Code-as-Monitor (CaM), a novel paradigm leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for both open-set reactive and proactive failure detection. The core of our method is to formulate both tasks as a unified set of spatio-temporal constraint satisfaction problems and use VLM-generated code to evaluate them for real-time monitoring. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring, we further introduce constraint elements that abstract constraint-related entities or their parts into compact geometric elements. This approach offers greater generality, simplifies tracking, and facilitates constraint-aware visual programming by leveraging these elements as visual prompts. Experiments show that CaM achieves a 28.7% higher success rate and reduces execution time by 31.8% under severe disturbances compared to baselines across three simulators and a real-world setting. Moreover, CaM can be integrated with open-loop control policies to form closed-loop systems, enabling long-horizon tasks in cluttered scenes with dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

| **[Exploring psychophysiological methods for human-robot collaboration in construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17078v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Psychophysiological methods present a promising approach to fostering enhanced mutual communication and collaboration between human workers and robots. Despite their potential, there is still limited understanding of how to effectively integrate psychophysiological methods to improve human-robot collaboration (HRC) in construction. This paper addresses this gap by critically reviewing the use of psychophysiological methods for HRC within construction environments, employing a concept-methodology-value philosophical framework. The analysis reveals that measuring brain activity using electroencephalography is the most widely used method, while most of the works are still at the proof of concept stage and lack empirical evidence. Three potential research directions were proposed: the integration of multi-modal psychophysiological signals, enriching the existing experimental settings for better generalizability, and leveraging advanced biocompatible or contactless technologies for effective signal detection. The findings should benefit subsequent exploration and practical applications of psychophysiological methods to enable better implementation of robots and support HRC in construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAPI: A Model for Learning Robot Facial Expressions from Human Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17046v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic robotic facial expression generation is crucial for human-robot interaction, as handcrafted methods based on fixed joint configurations often yield rigid and unnatural behaviors. Although recent automated techniques reduce the need for manual tuning, they tend to fall short by not adequately bridging the gap between human preferences and model predictions-resulting in a deficiency of nuanced and realistic expressions due to limited degrees of freedom and insufficient perceptual integration. In this work, we propose a novel learning-to-rank framework that leverages human feedback to address this discrepancy and enhanced the expressiveness of robotic faces. Specifically, we conduct pairwise comparison annotations to collect human preference data and develop the Human Affective Pairwise Impressions (HAPI) model, a Siamese RankNet-based approach that refines expression evaluation. Results obtained via Bayesian Optimization and online expression survey on a 35-DOF android platform demonstrate that our approach produces significantly more realistic and socially resonant expressions of Anger, Happiness, and Surprise than those generated by baseline and expert-designed methods. This confirms that our framework effectively bridges the gap between human preferences and model predictions while robustly aligning robotic expression generation with human affective responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavioral Conflict Avoidance Between Humans and Quadruped Robots in Shared Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17014v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, robots are increasingly operated in environments shared with humans, where conflicts between human and robot behaviors may compromise safety. This paper presents a proactive behavioral conflict avoidance framework based on the principle of adaptation to trends for quadruped robots that not only ensures the robot's safety but also minimizes interference with human activities. It can proactively avoid potential conflicts with approaching humans or other dynamic objects, whether the robot is stationary or in motion, then swiftly resume its tasks once the conflict subsides. An enhanced approach is proposed to achieve precise human detection and tracking on vibratory robot platform equipped with low-cost hybrid solid-state LiDAR. When potential conflict detected, the robot selects an avoidance point and executes an evasion maneuver before resuming its task. This approach contrasts with conventional methods that remain goal-driven, often resulting in aggressive behaviors, such as forcibly bypassing obstacles and causing conflicts or becoming stuck in deadlock scenarios. The selection of avoidance points is achieved by integrating static and dynamic obstacle to generate a potential field map. The robot then searches for feasible regions within this map and determines the optimal avoidance point using an evaluation function. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework significantly reduces interference with human activities, enhances the safety of both robots and persons.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Autonomous Exploration-Based Precise Mapping for Mobile Robots through Stepwise and Consistent Motions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17005v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an autonomous exploration framework. It is designed for indoor ground mobile robots that utilize laser Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), ensuring process completeness and precise mapping results. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on multiple Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. Traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. Adaptive sampling density adjustments, informed by obstacle distribution, enhance exploration coverage potential. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is adopted, wherein the robot strictly drives straight on approximately equidistant line segments in the polyline path and rotates in place at segment junctions. This simplified, decoupled motion pattern improves scan-matching stability and mitigates map drift. For process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillation caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is introduced to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency and precision. Experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness of the framework. It achieves improved mapping coverage and precision in more challenging environments compared to baseline 2D exploration algorithms. It also shows robustness in supporting resource-constrained robot platforms and maintaining mapping consistency across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures.

| **[Extending Behavior Trees for Robotic Missions with Quality Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16969v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context and motivation: In recent years, behavior trees have gained growing interest within the robotics community as a specification and control switching mechanism for the different tasks that form a robotics mission. Problem: Given the rising complexity and prevalence of robotic systems, it is increasingly challenging and important for practitioners to design high-quality missions that meet certain qualities, for instance, to consider potential failures or mitigate safety risks. In software requirements engineering, quality or non-functional requirements have long been recognized as a key factor in system success. Currently, qualities are not represented in behavior tree models, which capture a robotic mission, making it difficult to assess the extent to which different mission components comply with those qualities. Principal ideas: In this paper, we propose an extension for behavior trees to have qualities and quality requirements explicitly represented in robotics missions. We provide a meta-model for the extension, develop a domain-specific language (DSL), and describe how we integrated our DSL in one of the most used languages in robotics for developing behavior trees, BehaviorTree.CPP. A preliminary evaluation of the implemented DSL shows promising results for the feasibility of our approach and the need for similar DSLs. Contribution: Our approach paves the way for incorporating qualities into the behavior model of robotics missions. This promotes early expression of qualities in robotics missions, and a better overview of missions components and their contribution to the satisfaction of quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ) 2025</p></details> |
