| **[Improving Cooperation in Collaborative Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03153v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into multiagent systems has opened new possibilities for collaborative reasoning and cooperation with AI agents. This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making. We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task coordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for iterative system development and demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of UKCI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Action Deviation-Aware Inference for Low-Latency Wireless Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02851v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target model and selectively skips communication and computation for server operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model only inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA-R1: Enhancing Reasoning in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01623v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1.

| **[Beyond Needle(s) in the Embodied Haystack: Environment, Architecture, and Training Considerations for Long Context Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16928v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce $\infty$-THOR, a new framework for long-horizon embodied tasks that advances long-context understanding in embodied AI. $\infty$-THOR provides: (1) a generation framework for synthesizing scalable, reproducible, and unlimited long-horizon trajectories; (2) a novel embodied QA task, Needle(s) in the Embodied Haystack, where multiple scattered clues across extended trajectories test agents' long-context reasoning ability; and (3) a long-horizon dataset and benchmark suite featuring complex tasks that span hundreds of environment steps, each paired with ground-truth action sequences. To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust, long-term reasoning and planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing through Uncertainty: Robust Task-Oriented Optimization in Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00441v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual navigation is a fundamental problem in embodied AI, yet practical deployments demand long-horizon planning capabilities to address multi-objective tasks. A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned from limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural network-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that paradoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper introduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization. Specifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it transforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal calibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii) it reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization problem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments. Extensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation tasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in generalization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[CHAI: Command Hijacking against embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00181v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to handle edge cases in robotic vehicle systems where data is scarce by using common-sense reasoning grounded in perception and action to generalize beyond training distributions and adapt to novel real-world situations. These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Drones that Think on their Feet: Sudden Landing Decisions with Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00167v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms, faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete. Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models, provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand, advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[OceanGym: A Benchmark Environment for Underwater Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26536v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility, dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are available at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[What Can RL Bring to VLA Generalization? An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

| **[PinPoint3D: Fine-Grained 3D Part Segmentation from a Few Clicks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25970v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained, multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new 3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale, scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines, PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[ViewSpatial-Bench: Evaluating Multi-perspective Spatial Localization in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21500v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and reasoning about visual content, but significant challenges persist in tasks requiring cross-viewpoint understanding and spatial reasoning. We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Embodied Planning with Verifiable Reward for Real-World Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25852v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the planner. We will open-source both the dataset and the trained model upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning with Vision-Language Models in Ego-Centric Multi-View Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06266v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-and-Language Navigation with Analogical Textual Descriptions in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25139v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions. We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in navigation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02912v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end, with agents generating messages and actions concurrently. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), to simulate future states. Agents then communicate a summary of this plan. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

| **[PoseDiff: A Unified Diffusion Model Bridging Robot Pose Estimation and Video-to-Action Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24591v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI. The video visualization results can be found on the project page: https://haozhuo-zhang.github.io/PoseDiff-project-page/.</p></details> |  |
| **[CORE-3D: Context-aware Open-vocabulary Retrieval by Embeddings in 3D](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24528v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics, supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages without the refrences, 4 figures, sybmitted for ICLR 2026 conference</p></details> |
| **[Context and Diversity Matter: The Emergence of In-Context Learning in World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22353v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge; and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynaNav: Dynamic Feature and Layer Selection for Efficient Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21930v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However, existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders, suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability. Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time, and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across four public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a poster in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Intentional Gesture: Deliver Your Intentions with Gestures for Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15197v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When humans speak, gestures help convey communicative intentions, such as adding emphasis or describing concepts. However, current co-speech gesture generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (e.g. speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To address this gap, we introduce Intentional-Gesture, a novel framework that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in high-level communicative functions. First, we curate the InG dataset by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (i.e., text sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the Intentional Gesture Motion Tokenizer to leverage these intention annotations. It injects high-level communicative functions (e.g., intentions) into tokenized motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture</p></details> |  |
| **[Can AI Perceive Physical Danger and Intervene?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21651v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent -- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions. The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at https://asimov-benchmark.github.io/v2</p></details> |  |

Interactable digital twins of such objects have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. Unfortunately, current methods to digitize articulated real-world objects require carefully captured data, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable acquisition. We focus on motion analysis and part-level segmentation of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to obtain at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is challenging due to simultaneous object and camera motion and significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iTACO: a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories that is 20$\times$ larger than available in prior work. We then compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Our experiments show that iTACO outperforms existing articulated object digital twin methods on both synthetic and real casually captured RGBD videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website can be found at https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/video2articulation/</p></details> |
| **[Embodied AI: From LLMs to World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20021v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models (WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building internal representations and future predictions of the external world, facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances, covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e., embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs, meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE CASM</p></details> |
| **[SceneWeaver: All-in-One 3D Scene Synthesis with an Extensible and Self-Reflective Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20414v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

However, deploying such agents in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes. Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards real-world assistive robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plan Verification for LLM-Based Embodied Task Completion Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02761v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions, redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout). The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25 fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view), providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially, we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the leaderboards of Embodied Arena. This helps to establish clear research veins and pinpoint critical research problems, thereby driving forward progress in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, Embodied Arena Technical Report</p></details> |

Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.</p></details> |  |

As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate improvements of 20% and 40% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover, our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87-0.97) for the reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to diverse environments with minimal effort.

| **[Elevating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs with Auxiliary Embedding Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09585v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, the standard practice for developing MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/visper_lm/</p></details> |
| **[Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16176v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories (ACDC), an autonomous drone cinematography system driven by natural language communication between human directors and drones. The main limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent, which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models (VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.</p></details> |  |
| **[OptiScene: LLM-driven Indoor Scene Layout Generation via Scaled Human-aligned Data Synthesis and Multi-Stage Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07570v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emulating Human-like Adaptive Vision for Efficient and Flexible Machine Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15333v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition.

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

To overcome these obstacles, we propose RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pku-epic.github.io/NavFoM-Web/</p></details> |

Compared to traditional pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest.

For example, such knowledge directs an agent to grasp a knife by the handle for cutting or by the blade for safe handover. While existing approaches have made notable progress, affordance research still faces three key challenges: data scarcity, poor generalization, and real-world deployment. Specifically, there is a lack of large-scale affordance datasets with precise segmentation maps, existing models struggle to generalize across different domains or novel object and affordance classes, and little work demonstrates deployability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a complete affordance learning system that (1) takes in egocentric videos and outputs precise affordance annotations without human labeling, (2) leverages geometric information and vision foundation models to improve generalization, and (3) introduces a framework that facilitates affordance-oriented robotic manipulation such as tool grasping and robot-to-human tool handover. Experimental results show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by 13.8% in mIoU, and the framework achieves 77.1% successful grasping among 179 trials, including evaluations on seen, unseen classes, and cluttered scenes.

While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world, incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g., CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for complex, real-world environments.

This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

Existing approaches often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought (CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format, understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its robustness under limited onboard resources. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/Nav-R1.

However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v6)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |

Traditional sequential computation patterns, while effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by 2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and providing high throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning.

Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://aopolin-lv.github.io/F1-VLA/</p></details> |

World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

| **[Generative World Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: multi-modal multi-task foundation models (M3T-FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas federated learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied AI environments. In this vision paper, we introduce multi-modal multi-task federated foundation models (M3T-FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of M3T-FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed training nature of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical deployment dimensions of M3T-FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning, Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for deploying M3T-FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs. Finally, we present a prototype implementation of M3T-FFMs and evaluate their energy and latency performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in IEEE Internet of Things Magazine, 2025</p></details> |

While existing methods have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication to encourage future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Model Implanting for Test-time Adaptation of Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03956v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models, the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability. In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied AI: Emerging Risks and Opportunities for Policy Action](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00117v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI systems can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. With recent advances in AI models and hardware, EAI systems are becoming increasingly capable across wider operational domains. While EAI systems can offer many benefits, they also pose significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, as well as economic and societal disruption. These risks require urgent attention from policymakers, as existing policies governing industrial robots and autonomous vehicles are insufficient to address the full range of concerns EAI systems present. To help address this issue, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a taxonomy of the physical, informational, economic, and social risks EAI systems pose. Second, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to assess how existing frameworks address these risks and to identify critical gaps. We conclude by offering policy recommendations for the safe and beneficial deployment of EAI systems, such as mandatory testing and certification schemes, clarified liability frameworks, and strategies to manage EAI's potentially transformative economic and societal impacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[ANNIE: Be Careful of Your Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03383v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI) robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety, how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries; (2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with 2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3) ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era.

Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems.

Existing omnidirectional methods achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the \textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories (\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction, and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI.

| **[RobotxR1: Enabling Embodied Robotic Intelligence on Large Language Models through Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03238v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future robotic systems operating in real-world environments will require on-board embodied intelligence without continuous cloud connection, balancing capabilities with constraints on computational power and memory. This work presents an extension of the R1-zero approach, which enables the usage of low parameter-count Large Language Models (LLMs) in the robotic domain. The R1-Zero approach was originally developed to enable mathematical reasoning in LLMs using static datasets. We extend it to the robotics domain through integration in a closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. This extension enhances reasoning in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) settings without relying solely on distillation of large models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We show that small-scale LLMs can achieve effective reasoning performance by learning through closed-loop interaction with their environment, which enables tasks that previously required significantly larger models. In an autonomous driving setting, a performance gain of 20.2%-points over the SFT-based baseline is observed with a Qwen2.5-1.5B model. Using the proposed training procedure, Qwen2.5-3B achieves a 63.3% control adaptability score, surpassing the 58.5% obtained by the much larger, cloud-bound GPT-4o. These results highlight that practical, on-board deployment of small LLMs is not only feasible but can outperform larger models if trained through environmental feedback, underscoring the importance of an interactive learning framework for robotic Embodied AI, one grounded in practical experience rather than static supervision.</p></details> |  |

This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |

Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> |

Closely packed objects cause inevitable occlusions, making safe action generation particularly difficult. Under such partial observability, effective policies must not only generalize across diverse objects and layouts but also reason about occlusion to avoid collisions. However, collecting large-scale real-world data for this task remains prohibitively expensive, leaving this problem largely unsolved. In this paper, we introduce FetchBot, a sim-to-real framework for this challenge. We first curate a large-scale synthetic dataset featuring 1M diverse scenes and 500k representative demonstrations. Based on this dataset, FetchBot employs a depth-conditioned method for action generation, which leverages structural cues to enable robust obstacle-aware action planning. However, depth is perfect in simulation but noisy in real-world environments. To address this sim-to-real gap, FetchBot predicts depth from RGB inputs using a foundation model and integrates local occupancy prediction as a pre-training task, providing a generalizable latent representation for sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the strong zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, effective clutter handling, and adaptability to novel scenarios. In cluttered environments, it achieves an average real-world success rate of 89.95%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, FetchBot demonstrates excellent robustness in challenging cases, such as fetching transparent, reflective, and irregular objects, highlighting its practical value.</p></details> | <details><summary>9th A...</summary><p>9th Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025, Oral)</p></details> |

In this work, we address the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture. Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval; (ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of 3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass; (iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation, potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks.

However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution, and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands. This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500 complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot. We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.</p></details> |  |

Vision-Language-Action models, inspired by advancements in large foundation models, serve as universal robotic control frameworks that substantially improve agent-environment interaction capabilities in embodied intelligence systems. This expansion has broadened application scenarios for embodied AI robots. This survey comprehensively reviews VLA models for embodied manipulation. Firstly, it chronicles the developmental trajectory of VLA architectures. Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of current research across 5 critical dimensions: VLA model structures, training datasets, pre-training methods, post-training methods, and model evaluation. Finally, we synthesize key challenges in VLA development and real-world deployment, while outlining promising future research directions.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

To formalize this setting, we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by both LLM-based and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + 2 pages references + 7 pages appendix</p></details> |

However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Embod...</summary><p>Embodied-R1 technical report</p></details> |

In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |

However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We present Switch4EAI(Switch-for-Embodied-AI), a low-cost and easily deployable pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games to evaluate whole-body robot control policies. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future work to for benchmarking embodied AI.</p></details> | Workshop Submission |
| **[Virtuous Machines: Towards Artificial General Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13421v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness, executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments, accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored. It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and the attribution of scientific credit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied Image Quality Assessment for Robotic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18774v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of User-Generated Content (UGC) is a critical technique for human Quality of Experience (QoE). However, does the the image quality of Robot-Generated Content (RGC) demonstrate traits consistent with the Moravec paradox, potentially conflicting with human perceptual norms? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the perception mechanism of embodied robots for image quality. We propose the first Embodied Preference Database (EPD), which contains 12,500 distorted image annotations. We establish assessment metrics based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, there is a gap between UGC and RGC. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-scale Attention Embodied Image Quality Assessment called MA-EIQA. For the proposed EPD dataset, this is the first no-reference IQA model designed for embodied robot. Finally, the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.</p></details> |  |

FormCoach transforms a simple camera into an always-on, interactive AI training partner, capable of spotting subtle form errors and delivering tailored corrections in real time, leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Affordance-Aware Robotic Dexterous Grasping with Human-like Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08896v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage, a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects, unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open dynamic environments. Recent breakthroughs in large models have revolutionized embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms, detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution, and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved, challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey, potentially as the further research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoSE: Skill-by-Skill Mixture-of-Experts Learning for Embodied Autonomous Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07818v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet the growing demand for smarter, faster, and more efficient embodied AI solutions, we introduce a novel Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) method that significantly boosts reasoning and learning efficiency for embodied autonomous systems. General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization, which limits their applicability in embodied AI such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose a skill-oriented MoE called MoSE, which mimics the human learning and reasoning process skill-by-skill, step-by-step. We introduce a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. To better align with multi-step planning in human reasoning and in end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike other multi-round dialogues, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g. perception-prediction-planning for AD, and high-level and low-level planning for robots) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model effectively grows more diverse expertise and outperforms models on both AD corner-case reasoning tasks and robot reasoning tasks with less than 40% of the parameters.</p></details> |  |

We also provide a rich variety of playable entities, including humans, animals, robots, and vehicles for embodied AI research. We extend UnrealCV with optimized APIs and tools for data collection, environment augmentation, distributed training, and benchmarking. These improvements achieve significant improvements in the efficiency of rendering and communication, enabling advanced applications such as multi-agent interactions. Our experimental evaluation across visual navigation and tracking tasks reveals two key insights: 1) environmental diversity provides substantial benefits for developing generalizable reinforcement learning (RL) agents, and 2) current embodied agents face persistent challenges in open-world scenarios, including navigation in unstructured terrain, adaptation to unseen morphologies, and managing latency in the close-loop control systems for interacting in highly dynamic objects. UnrealZoo thus serves as both a comprehensive testing ground and a pathway toward developing more capable embodied AI systems for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight), Project page: http://unrealzoo.site/</p></details> |

Generating synthetic images that closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins, facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using images generated by DiffPhysCam.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 17 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

This task requires the model to identify newly described objects that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that 3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language expressions in a spatially aware paradigm.

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

As robotics and automated systems scale, efficient data-sharing frameworks and robust algorithms become critical. We explore the pivotal role of data handling in next-gen networks, focusing on dynamics between application and network providers (AP/NP) in DT ecosystems. We introduce PANAMA, a novel algorithm with Priority Asymmetry for Network Aware Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based multi-agent path finding (MAPF). By adopting a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework and asynchronous actor-learner architectures, PANAMA accelerates training while enabling autonomous task execution by embodied AI. Our approach demonstrates superior pathfinding performance in accuracy, speed, and scalability compared to existing benchmarks. Through simulations, we highlight optimized data-sharing strategies for scalable, automated systems, ensuring resilience in complex, real-world environments. PANAMA bridges the gap between network-aware decision-making and robust multi-agent coordination, advancing the synergy between DTs, wireless networks, and AI-driven automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety of Embodied Navigation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05855v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention, particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety and increasing industrial efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We present OmniEAR, a comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to 56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically (0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/OmniEmbodied Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/OmniEmbodied</p></details> |

In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentSense: Virtual Sensor Data Generation Using LLM Agents in Simulated Home Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11773v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence.

| **[Exploring 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Activity Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D task planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advances in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the RoboTron-Craft, a stage-divided and cost-effective pipeline for realistic manipulation generation. Base on this, the RoboTron-Platter method is introduced, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.

| **[Object Affordance Recognition and Grounding via Multi-scale Cross-modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01184v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification). Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance grounding and classification.</p></details> |  |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Exploring the Link Between Bayesian Inference and Embodied Intelligence: Toward Open Physical-World Embodied AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21589v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open physical-world embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages |

| **[Reward Models are Metrics in a Trench Coat](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03231v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language models has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess the quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is also performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI model. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include susceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking, methods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our position paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help overcome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward models on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas. Grounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer alignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and calibration-aware meta-evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Anchor: Large Language Model Reasoning via Step-by-step Attention Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03223v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To solve complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), prompting-based methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. However, as reasoning chains extend, critical intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context, receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning tasks without retraining.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods typically address this by maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of \textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse. This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a $60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$ over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.</p></details> |  |
| **[To Distill or Decide? Understanding the Algorithmic Trade-off in Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03207v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially observable domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 9 figures, published at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Q-Learning with Shift-Aware Upper Confidence Bound in Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03181v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting, such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm (QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fixing That Free Lunch: When, Where, and Why Synthetic Data Fails in Model-Based Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01457v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms generalize.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCOPED: Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator for Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01456v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that, in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator. On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces, identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes. These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision, outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.</p></details> |  |
| **[MM-Nav: Multi-View VLA Model for Robust Visual Navigation via Multi-Expert Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03142v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However, optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner. Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360 observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further confirm the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pku-epic.github.io/MM-Nav-Web/</p></details> |
| **[Post Reinforcement Learning Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08854v5)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study estimation and inference using data collected by reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. These algorithms adaptively experiment by interacting with individual units over multiple stages, updating their strategies based on past outcomes. Our goal is to evaluate a counterfactual policy after data collection and estimate structural parameters, such as dynamic treatment effects, that support credit assignment and quantify the impact of early actions on final outcomes. These parameters can often be defined as solutions to moment equations, motivating moment-based estimation methods developed for static data. In RL settings, however, data are often collected adaptively under nonstationary behavior policies. As a result, standard estimators fail to achieve asymptotic normality due to time-varying variance. We propose a weighted generalized method of moments (GMM) approach that uses adaptive weights to stabilize this variance. We characterize weighting schemes that ensure consistency and asymptotic normality of the weighted GMM estimators, enabling valid hypothesis testing and uniform confidence region construction. Key applications include dynamic treatment effect estimation and dynamic off-policy evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[To Backtrack or Not to Backtrack: When Sequential Search Limits Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07052v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their reasoning abilities, particularly through techniques involving search and backtracking. Backtracking naturally scales test-time compute by enabling sequential, linearized exploration via long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, this is not the only strategy for scaling test time-compute: parallel sampling with best-of-N selection provides an alternative that generates diverse solutions simultaneously. Despite the growing adoption of sequential search, its advantages over parallel sampling-especially under a fixed compute budget-remain poorly understood. In this paper, we systematically compare these two approaches on two challenging reasoning tasks: CountDown and Sudoku. Surprisingly, we find that sequential search underperforms parallel sampling on CountDown but outperforms it on Sudoku, suggesting that backtracking is not universally beneficial. We identify two factors that can cause backtracking to degrade performance: (1) training on fixed search traces can lock models intro suboptimal strategies, and (2) explicit CoT supervision can discourage implicit (non verbalized) reasoning. Extending our analysis to reinforcement learning (RL), we show that models with backtracking capabilities benefit significantly from RL fine-tuning, while models without backtracking see limited, mixed gains. Together, these findings challenge the assumption that backtracking universally enhances LLM reasoning, instead revealing a complex interaction between task structure, training data, model scale, and learning paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |
| **[Risk-Sensitive Agent Compositions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04632v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized AI agents to complete them. We formalize agentic workflows as directed acyclic graphs, called agent graphs, where edges represent AI agents and paths correspond to feasible compositions of agents. Real-world deployment requires selecting agent compositions that not only maximize task success but also minimize violations of safety, fairness, and privacy requirements which demands a careful analysis of the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In this work, we consider risk minimization over the set of feasible agent compositions and seek to minimize the value-at-risk of the loss distribution of the agent composition where the loss quantifies violations of these requirements. We introduce an efficient algorithm which traverses the agent graph and finds a near-optimal composition of agents. It uses a dynamic programming approach to approximate the value-at-risk of agent compositions by exploiting a union bound. Furthermore, we prove that the approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

While robust detection frameworks and diverse, large-scale datasets are essential to mitigate these risks, existing academic efforts remain limited in scope: current datasets lack the diversity, scale, and realism required for social media contexts, while detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen generative technologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce So-Fake-Set, a comprehensive social media-oriented dataset with over 2 million high-quality images, diverse generative sources, and photorealistic imagery synthesized using 35 state-of-the-art generative models. To rigorously evaluate cross-domain robustness, we establish a novel and large-scale (100K) out-of-domain benchmark (So-Fake-OOD) featuring synthetic imagery from commercial models explicitly excluded from the training distribution, creating a realistic testbed for evaluating real-world performance. Leveraging these resources, we present So-Fake-R1, an advanced vision-language framework that employs reinforcement learning for highly accurate forgery detection, precise localization, and explainable inference through interpretable visual rationales. Extensive experiments show that So-Fake-R1 outperforms the second-best method, with a 1.3% gain in detection accuracy and a 4.5% increase in localization IoU. By integrating a scalable dataset, a challenging OOD benchmark, and an advanced detection framework, this work establishes a new foundation for social media-centric forgery detection research. The code, models, and datasets will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Close Enough Traveling Salesman Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03065v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL) framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii). Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness to dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

The focus is on parametrized action (PA) spaces, eliminating the need for recurrent networks, with benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 testing discrete actions linked to continuous action-parameter spaces. Hyperparameter optimization was performed with Microsoft NNI, ensuring reproducibility by modifying the codebase for GAC and TQC. Results show that Parameterized Action Greedy Actor-Critic (PAGAC) outperformed other algorithms, achieving the fastest training times and highest returns across benchmarks, completing 5,000 episodes in 41:24 for the Platform game and 24:04 for the Robot Soccer Goal game.

| **[Statistical Inference for Temporal Difference Learning with Linear Function Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16106v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the statistical properties of Temporal Difference (TD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging, arguably one of the most widely used algorithms in reinforcement learning, for the task of estimating the parameters of the optimal linear approximation to the value function. Assuming independent samples, we make three theoretical contributions that improve upon the current state-of-the-art results: (i) we derive sharper high probability convergence guarantees that depend explicitly on the asymptotic variance and hold under weaker conditions than those adopted in the literature; (ii) we establish refined high-dimensional Berry-Esseen bounds over the class of convex sets, achieving faster rates than the best known results, and (iii) we propose and analyze a novel, computationally efficient online plug-in estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix. These results enable the construction of confidence regions and simultaneous confidence intervals for the linear parameters of the value function approximation, with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose, pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to 20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining, we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model are available at: https://github.com/jamisonmeindl/zeroshotopt</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributional Inverse Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03013v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD) violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Provable Emergence of In-Context Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18389v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typically, a modern reinforcement learning (RL) agent solves a task by updating its neural network parameters to adapt its policy to the task. Recently, it has been observed that some RL agents can solve a wide range of new out-of-distribution tasks without parameter updates after pretraining on some task distribution. When evaluated in a new task, instead of making parameter updates, the pretrained agent conditions its policy on additional input called the context, e.g., the agent's interaction history in the new task. The agent's performance increases as the information in the context increases, with the agent's parameters fixed. This phenomenon is typically called in-context RL (ICRL). The pretrained parameters of the agent network enable the remarkable ICRL phenomenon. However, many ICRL works perform the pretraining with standard RL algorithms. This raises the central question this paper aims to address: Why can the RL pretraining algorithm generate network parameters that enable ICRL? We hypothesize that the parameters capable of ICRL are minimizers of the pretraining loss. This work provides initial support for this hypothesis through a case study. In particular, we prove that when a Transformer is pretrained for policy evaluation, one of the global minimizers of the pretraining loss can enable in-context temporal difference learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, 29 pages</p></details> |

We introduce FR-LUX (Friction-aware, Regime-conditioned Learning under eXecution costs), a reinforcement learning framework that learns after-cost trading policies and remains robust across volatility-liquidity regimes. FR-LUX integrates three ingredients: (i) a microstructure-consistent execution model combining proportional and impact costs, directly embedded in the reward; (ii) a trade-space trust region that constrains changes in inventory flow rather than logits, yielding stable low-turnover updates; and (iii) explicit regime conditioning so the policy specializes to LL/LH/HL/HH states without fragmenting the data. On a 4 x 5 grid of regimes and cost levels with multiple random seeds, FR-LUX achieves the top average Sharpe ratio with narrow bootstrap confidence intervals, maintains a flatter cost-performance slope than strong baselines, and attains superior risk-return efficiency for a given turnover budget. Pairwise scenario-level improvements are strictly positive and remain statistically significant after multiple-testing corrections. We provide formal guarantees on optimality under convex frictions, monotonic improvement under a KL trust region, long-run turnover bounds and induced inaction bands due to proportional costs, positive value advantage for regime-conditioned policies, and robustness to cost misspecification. The methodology is implementable: costs are calibrated from standard liquidity proxies, scenario-level inference avoids pseudo-replication, and all figures and tables are reproducible from released artifacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, includes theoretical guarantees and empirical evaluation, submitted to AI/ML in Finance track</p></details> |
| **[QiMeng-CodeV-R1: Reasoning-Enhanced Verilog Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24183v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved breakthroughs on tasks with explicit, automatable verification, such as software programming and mathematical problems. Extending RLVR to electronic design automation (EDA), especially automatically generating hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog from natural-language (NL) specifications, however, poses three key challenges: the lack of automated and accurate verification environments, the scarcity of high-quality NL-code pairs, and the prohibitive computation cost of RLVR. To this end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog generation LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that performs robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we propose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog snippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency via the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a high-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage "distill-then-RL" training pipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by adaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by adaptively adjusting sampling rate. The resulting model, CodeV-R1-7B, achieves 68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on VerilogEval v2 and RTLLM v1.1, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 12~20%, while even exceeding the performance of 671B DeepSeek-R1 on RTLLM. We have released our model, training code, and dataset to facilitate research in EDA and LLM communities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ergodic Risk Measures: Towards a Risk-Aware Foundation for Continual Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02945v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date, continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected (or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results, which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk measures.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTRec: Learning to Align with User Preferences via Mental Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22807v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation models are predominantly trained using implicit user feedback, since explicit feedback is often costly to obtain. However, implicit feedback, such as clicks, does not always reflect users' real preferences. For example, a user might click on a news article because of its attractive headline, but end up feeling uncomfortable after reading the content. In the absence of explicit feedback, such erroneous implicit signals may severely mislead recommender systems. In this paper, we propose MTRec, a novel sequential recommendation framework designed to align with real user preferences by uncovering their internal satisfaction on recommended items. Specifically, we introduce a mental reward model to quantify user satisfaction and propose a distributional inverse reinforcement learning approach to learn it. The learned mental reward model is then used to guide recommendation models to better align with users' real preferences. Our experiments show that MTRec brings significant improvements to a variety of recommendation models. We also deploy MTRec on an industrial short video platform and observe a 7 percent increase in average user viewing time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-rewarding: Stable Self-supervised RL for Eliciting Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00410v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is effective to improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), its reliance on human-annotated labels leads to the scaling up dilemma, especially for complex tasks. Recent self-rewarding methods investigate a label-free alternative to unlock the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, yet they frequently encounter the non-negligible training collapse issue, as the single-view supervision signal easily forms the self-consistent illusion, yielding the reward hacking. Inspired by the success of self-supervised learning, we propose \textit{Co-rewarding}, a novel self-supervised RL framework that improves training stability by seeking complementary supervision from another views. Specifically, we instantiate Co-rewarding in two ways: (1) \textit{Co-rewarding-I} is a data-side instantiation that derives reward signals from contrastive agreement across semantically analogous questions; and (2) \textit{Co-rewarding-II} is a model-side instantiation that maintains a slowly-updated reference teacher with pseudo labels to realize self-distillation. Intuitively, such instantiations introduce different levels of discrepancy to increase the difficulty of training collapse on trivial reasoning solutions. Empirically, Co-rewarding exhibits stable training across various setups, and outperforms other self-rewarding baselines by $+3.31\%$ improvements on average on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, especially by $+7.49\%$ on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct. Notably, Co-rewarding reaches or even surpasses RLVR with ground-truth (GT) label in several cases, such as a Pass@$1$ of $94.01\%$ on GSM8K with Qwen3-8B-Base remarkably higher than GT. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/Co-rewarding.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates RL-based control for entropy-regularized Linear Quadratic control (LQC) problems with multiplicative noises over an infinite time horizon. First, we adapt the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm to stochastic optimal control settings, proving that despite the non-convexity of the problem, RPG converges globally under conditions of gradient domination and near-smoothness. Second, based on zero-order optimization approach, we introduce a novel model free RL algorithm: Sample-Based Regularized Policy Gradient (SB-RPG). SB-RPG operates without knowledge of system parameters yet still retains strong theoretical guarantees of global convergence. Our model leverages entropy regularization to accelerate convergence and address the exploration versus exploitation trade-off inherent in RL. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficacy of SB-RPG in unknown-parameters environments.</p></details> | 33 pages, 4 figures |

Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards, but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Efficient Reasoning Workshop at NeuRIPS 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we provide a systematic introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based finetuning. Finally, we discuss critical open questions regarding the selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs, which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first practical way for discretized visual diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/martian422/MaskGRPO</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, Monotonic Q-Learning with Upper Confidence Bound (MQL-UCB) for RL with general function approximation. Our key algorithmic design includes (1) a general deterministic policy-switching strategy that achieves low switching cost, (2) a monotonic value function structure with carefully controlled function class complexity, and (3) a variance-weighted regression scheme that exploits historical trajectories with high data efficiency. MQL-UCB achieves minimax optimal regret of $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{HK})$ when $K$ is sufficiently large and near-optimal policy switching cost of $\tilde{O}(dH)$, with $d$ being the eluder dimension of the function class, $H$ being the planning horizon, and $K$ being the number of episodes. Our work sheds light on designing provably sample-efficient and deployment-efficient Q-learning with nonlinear function approximation.</p></details> | 46 pages, 1 table |
| **[SelfBudgeter: Adaptive Token Allocation for Efficient LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11274v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reasoning models demonstrate exceptional performance on complex tasks, they often exhibit tendencies of overthinking on simple problems. This phenomenon not only leads to excessive computational resource consumption but also significantly degrades user experience. To address this challenge, we propose SelfBudgeter - a novel user-friendly adaptive controllable reasoning framework that incorporates a budget estimation mechanism prior to reasoning. The framework adopts a dual-phase training paradigm: during the cold-start phase, the model learns to predict token budgets before executing reasoning in a standardized format; in the reinforcement learning phase, the model is trained to autonomously plan budgets based on problem difficulty and strictly adhere to them when generating responses. Since the model outputs budget estimates at the initial stage, users can immediately anticipate waiting duration, enabling flexible decisions on whether to interrupt or continue the generation process. Notably, our method supports manual control of reasoning length through pre-filled budget fields. Experimental results demonstrate that SelfBudgeter can dynamically allocate budgets according to problem complexity, yielding an average response length compression of 61% for the 1.5B model on GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2025, and 48% for the 7B model, while maintaining nearly undiminished accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Model Routing in Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02850v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining $O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.</p></details> |  |

This is achieved by combining the adduction/abduction (Add/Abd) joint of digits four and five into a single joint with a large range of motion. The combined joint increases the workspace of the digits by 400% and reduces the required DoFs while retaining dexterity. Experimental results demonstrate that the combined Add/Abd joint enables the hand to grasp objects with a side distance of up to 200 mm. Reinforcement learning-based investigations show that the design enables grasping policies that are effective not only for handling larger objects but also for achieving enhanced grasp stability. In teleoperated trials, the hand successfully performed 86% of attempted grasps on suitable YCB objects, including challenging non-anthropomorphic configurations. These findings validate the design's ability to enhance grasp stability, flexibility, and dexterous manipulation without added complexity, making it well-suited for a wide range of applications.

Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Intention-driven Lane Change Framework Considering Heterogeneous Dynamic Cooperation in Mixed-traffic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22550v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed-traffic environments, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with diverse human-driven vehicles (HVs), unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging. Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle. Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\% F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |

A central obstacle is environmental stochasticity, as real systems involve noisy observations, unpredictable dynamics, and non-stationary conditions that undermine the stability of current methods. Existing benchmarks rarely capture these uncertainties and favor simplified settings where algorithms can be tuned to succeed. The absence of a well-defined taxonomy of stochasticity further complicates evaluation, as robustness to one type of stochastic perturbation, such as sticky actions, does not guarantee robustness to other forms of uncertainty. To address this critical gap, we introduce STORI (STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that systematically incorporates diverse stochastic effects and enables rigorous evaluation of RL techniques under different forms of uncertainty. We propose a comprehensive five-type taxonomy of environmental stochasticity and demonstrate systematic vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithms through targeted evaluation of DreamerV3 and STORM. Our findings reveal that world models dramatically underestimate environmental variance, struggle with action corruption, and exhibit unreliable dynamics under partial observability. We release the code and benchmark publicly at https://github.com/ARY2260/stori, providing a unified framework for developing more robust RL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2.

While modern video games may offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL experimentation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of self-evolving agent training.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes, and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved. Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1 achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability, as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, existing methods often rely on execution-based or LLM-based Bradley-Terry reward models. The former suffers from high execution latency caused by repeated database calls, whereas the latter imposes substantial GPU memory overhead, both of which significantly hinder the efficiency and scalability of RL pipelines. To this end, we propose a novel reward model framework for RL-based Text-to-SQL named Graph-Reward-SQL, which employs the GMNScore outcome reward model. We leverage SQL graph representations to provide accurate reward signals while significantly reducing time cost and GPU memory usage. Building on this foundation, we further introduce StepRTM, a stepwise reward model that provides intermediate supervision over Common Table Expression (CTE) subqueries. This encourages both functional correctness and readability of SQL. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments on standard benchmarks, including Spider and BIRD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing reward models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Control-Barrier-Function-Based Algorithm for Policy Adaptation in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02720v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers the problem of adapting a predesigned policy, represented by a parameterized function class, from a solution that minimizes a given original cost function to a trade-off solution between minimizing the original objective and an additional cost function. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, where deviations from the optimal value of the original cost are explicitly constrained. To solve it, we develop a closed-loop system that governs the evolution of the policy parameters, with a closed-loop controller designed to adjust the additional cost gradient to ensure the satisfaction of the constraint. The resulting closed-loop system, termed control-barrier-function-based policy adaptation, exploits the set-invariance property of control barrier functions to guarantee constraint satisfaction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on the Cartpole and Lunar Lander benchmarks from OpenAI Gym, as well as a quadruped robot, thereby illustrating both its practicality and potential for real-world policy adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAMAC: Multimodal Risk-Aware Offline Reinforcement Learning and the Role of Behavior Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02695v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks.

However, the length of their chain-of-thought reasoning is not controllable, making it impossible to allocate test-time compute to achieve a desired level of performance. We introduce Length Controlled Policy Optimization (LCPO), a simple reinforcement learning method that optimizes for accuracy and adherence to user-specified length constraints. We use LCPO to train L1, a reasoning language model that produces outputs satisfying a length constraint given in its prompt. L1's length control allows for smoothly trading off computational cost and accuracy on a wide range of tasks, and outperforms the state-of-the-art S1 method for length control. Furthermore, we uncover an unexpected short chain-of-thought capability in models trained with LCPO. Specifically, using LCPO we derive Short Reasoning Models (SRMs), that exhibit similar reasoning patterns as full-length reasoning models, but can generate CoT lengths comparable to non-reasoning models. They demonstrate significant performance gains, for instance, our 1.5B L1 model surpasses GPT-4o at equal reasoning lengths. Overall, LCPO enables precise control over reasoning length, allowing for fine-grained allocation of test-time compute and accuracy.

| **[Rubrics as Rewards: Reinforcement Learning Beyond Verifiable Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17746v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for complex reasoning tasks with clear correctness signals such as math and coding. However, extending it to real-world reasoning tasks is challenging, as evaluation depends on nuanced, multi-criteria judgments rather than binary correctness. Instance-specific rubrics have recently been used in evaluation benchmarks to capture such judgments, but their potential as reward signals for on-policy post-training remains underexplored. We introduce $\textbf{Rubrics as Rewards}$ (RaR), an on-policy reinforcement learning method that extends RLVR beyond verifiable domains by using rubric-based feedback. Across both medical and science domains, we evaluate multiple strategies for aggregating rubric feedback into rewards. The best RaR variant achieves relative improvements of up to $31\%$ on HealthBench and $7\%$ on GPQA-Diamond over popular LLM-as-judge baselines that rely on direct Likert-based rewards. These results demonstrate that RaR-trained policies adapt well to diverse evaluation formats, performing strongly on both rubric-based and multiple-choice tasks. Moreover, we find that using rubrics as structured reward signals yields better alignment for smaller judges and reduces performance variance across judge scales.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Grounding Multimodal LLMs to Embodied Agents that Ask for Help with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00907v5)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents operating in household environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent is tasked with a single or multi-object rearrangement task using an under-specified instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines including GPT-4o as well as supervised fine-tuned MLLMs on our task. Our results show that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (10.4-16.5%), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details> |  |

However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations, evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Performance Gap in Preference Learning: A Dichotomy of RLHF and DPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19770v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a fine-grained theoretical analysis of the performance gap between reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) under a representation gap. Our study decomposes this gap into two sources: an explicit representation gap under exact optimization and an implicit representation gap under finite samples. In the exact optimization setting, we characterize how the relative capacities of the reward and policy model classes influence the final policy qualities. We show that RLHF, DPO, or online DPO can outperform one another depending on type of model mis-specifications. Notably, online DPO can outperform both RLHF and standard DPO when the reward and policy model classes are isomorphic and both mis-specified. In the approximate optimization setting, we provide a concrete construction where the ground-truth reward is implicitly sparse and show that RLHF requires significantly fewer samples than DPO to recover an effective reward model -- highlighting a statistical advantage of two-stage learning. Together, these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the performance gap between RLHF and DPO under various settings, and offer practical insights into when each method is preferred.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 5 figures.

| **[On the Role of Temperature Sampling in Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02611v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces. Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3 (0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning (RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent potential of base models.</p></details> |  |

While effective, the target network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping. Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Benchmark Study of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for the Container Stowage Planning Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02589v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP, systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime logistics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful approach for aligning generative models, but its reliance on learned reward models makes it vulnerable to mis-specification and reward hacking. Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) offers a more robust alternative by directly leveraging noisy binary comparisons over trajectories. We study the best policy identification problem in PbRL, motivated by post-training optimization of generative models, for example, during multi-turn interactions. Learning in this setting combines an offline preference dataset--potentially biased or out-of-distribution and collected from a rater of subpar 'competence'--with online pure exploration, making systematic online learning essential. To this end, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling that maintains posteriors over the reward model and dynamics. We provide the first Bayesian simple regret guarantees for PbRL and introduce an efficient approximation that outperforms existing baselines on simulation and image generation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysHMR: Learning Humanoid Control Policies from Vision for Physically Plausible Human Motion Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02566v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy 3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios, outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective, recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create calibrated scalar rewards-- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce $GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 39th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, ARLET Workshop (Aligning Reinforcement Learning Experimentalists and Theorists)</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Interact in World Latent for Team Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25550v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Web: ...</summary><p>Web: https://dongsuleetech.github.io/projects/IWoL/</p></details> |
| **[Exploiting Tree Structure for Credit Assignment in RL Training of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18314v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning improves LLM reasoning, yet sparse delayed reward over long sequences makes token-level credit assignment the key bottleneck. We study the verifiable-reward setting, where the final answer is checkable and multiple responses can be drawn per prompt. Reasoning tasks in math and medical QA align with this setup, where only a few decision tokens significantly impact the outcome. PPO offers token-level advantages with a learned value model, but it is complex to train both the actor and critic models simultaneously, and it is not easily generalizable, as the token-level values from the critic model can make training prone to overfitting. GRPO is critic-free and supports verifiable rewards, but spreads a single sequence-level return across tokens and ignores branching. We introduce \textbf{Prefix-to-Tree (P2T)}, a simple procedure that converts a group of responses into a prefix tree and computes \emph{nonparametric} prefix values \(V(s)\) by aggregating descendant outcomes. Built on P2T, we propose \textbf{TEMPO} (\emph{\textbf{T}ree-\textbf{E}stimated \textbf{M}ean Prefix Value for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization}), a critic-free algorithm that augments the group-relative outcome signal of GRPO with \emph{branch-gated} temporal-difference corrections derived from the tree. At non-branch tokens, the temporal-difference (TD) term is zero, so TEMPO reduces to GRPO; at branching tokens, it supplies precise token-level credit without a learned value network or extra judges/teachers. On Qwen3-1.7B/4B, TEMPO outperforms PPO and GRPO on in-distribution (MATH, MedQA) and out-of-distribution (GSM-HARD, AMC23, MedMCQA, MMLU-Medical) benchmarks, and reaches higher validation accuracy with roughly the same wall-clock time.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Fog computing has emerged as a solution for processing these IoT applications, but it faces challenges such as resource allocation and job scheduling. Therefore, it is crucial to determine how to assign and schedule tasks on Fog nodes. This work aims to schedule tasks in IoT while minimizing the total energy consumption of nodes and enhancing the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of IoT tasks, taking into account task deadlines. This paper classifies Fog nodes into two categories based on their traffic level: low and high. It schedules short-deadline tasks on low-traffic nodes using an Improved Golden Eagle Optimization (IGEO) algorithm, an enhancement that utilizes genetic operators for discretization. Long-deadline tasks are processed on high-traffic nodes using reinforcement learning (RL). This combined approach is called the Reinforcement Improved Golden Eagle Optimization (RIGEO) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that RIGEO achieves up to a 29% reduction in energy consumption, up to an 86% improvement in response time, and up to a 19% reduction in deadline violations compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |

These substrates must operate reliably in heterogeneous and permissionless environments, where Network Address Translators (NATs) and firewalls impose significant constraints. Existing solutions, however, are either designed for controlled data center deployments or implemented as monolithic systems that tightly couple machine learning logic with networking code. To address these limitations, we present Lattica, a decentralized cross-NAT communication framework designed to support distributed AI systems. Lattica integrates three core components. First, it employs a robust suite of NAT traversal mechanisms to establish a globally addressable peer-to-peer mesh. Second, it provides a decentralized data store based on Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), ensuring verifiable and eventually consistent state replication. Third, it incorporates a content discovery layer that leverages distributed hash tables (DHTs) together with an optimized RPC protocol for efficient model synchronization. By integrating these components, Lattica delivers a complete protocol stack for sovereign, resilient, and scalable AI systems that operate independently of centralized intermediaries. It is directly applicable to edge intelligence, collaborative reinforcement learning, and other large-scale distributed machine learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Imitation: Recovering Dense Rewards from Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02493v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert demonstrations.</p></details> |  |

DRL has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and, like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.</p></details> |  |

Conversely, deep reinforcement learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization (ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.</p></details> |  |

While optimal alignment can be mathematically computed under ideal conditions, real-world deviations caused by manufacturing tolerances often render this approach impractical. Measuring these tolerances can be costly or even infeasible, and neglecting them may result in suboptimal alignments. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that learns exclusively in the pixel space of the sensor output, eliminating the need to develop expert-designed alignment concepts. We conduct an extensive benchmark study and show that our approach surpasses other methods in speed, precision, and robustness. We further introduce relign, a realistic, freely explorable, open-source simulation utilizing physically based rendering that models optical systems with non-deterministic manufacturing tolerances and noise in robotic alignment movement. It provides an interface to popular machine learning frameworks, enabling seamless experimentation and development. Our work highlights the potential of RL in a manufacturing environment to enhance efficiency of optical alignments while minimizing the need for manual intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-Fidelity Control Variate Approach for Policy Gradient Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05696v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are impractical for deployment in operational systems or for training with computationally expensive high-fidelity simulations, as they require large amounts of data. Meanwhile, low-fidelity simulators -- such as reduced-order models, heuristic rewards, or generative world models -- can cheaply provide useful data for RL training, even if they are too coarse for zero-shot transfer. We propose multi-fidelity policy gradients (MFPGs), an RL framework that mixes a small amount of data from the target environment with a control variate formed from a large volume of low-fidelity simulation data to construct an unbiased, variance-reduced estimator for on-policy policy gradients. We instantiate the framework with a multi-fidelity variant of the classical REINFORCE algorithm. We show that under standard assumptions, the MFPG estimator guarantees asymptotic convergence of REINFORCE to locally optimal policies in the target environment, and achieves faster finite-sample convergence rates compared to training with high-fidelity data alone. Empirically, we evaluate the MFPG algorithm across a suite of simulated robotics benchmark tasks with limited high-fidelity data but abundant off-dynamics, low-fidelity data. With mild--moderate dynamics gaps, MFPG reliably improves the median performance over a high-fidelity-only baseline, matching the performance of leading multi-fidelity baselines despite its simplicity and minimal tuning overhead. Under large dynamics gaps, MFPG demonstrates the strongest robustness among the evaluated multi-fidelity approaches. An additional experiment shows that MFPG can remain effective even under low-fidelity reward misspecification. Thus, MFPG not only offers a novel paradigm for efficient sim-to-real transfer but also provides a principled approach to managing the trade-off between policy performance and data collection costs.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, assembling large, execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability. We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective, and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches 93.2% execution success and 61.8% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2% (exec.) and 44.4% (match). In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Potential for Catastrophic Failure in Dynamic Post-Training Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02457v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this "detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their "robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Train Your Advisor: Steering Black-Box LLMs with Advisor Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02453v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting. While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tree-based Dialogue Reinforced Policy Optimization for Red-Teaming Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02286v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings, where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success across multiple turns.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Combat Reactive and Dynamic Jamming Attacks with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02265v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retargeting Matters: General Motion Retargeting for Humanoid Motion Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02252v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid motion tracking policies are central to building teleoperation pipelines and hierarchical controllers, yet they face a fundamental challenge: the embodiment gap between humans and humanoid robots. Current approaches address this gap by retargeting human motion data to humanoid embodiments and then training reinforcement learning (RL) policies to imitate these reference trajectories. However, artifacts introduced during retargeting, such as foot sliding, self-penetration, and physically infeasible motion are often left in the reference trajectories for the RL policy to correct. While prior work has demonstrated motion tracking abilities, they often require extensive reward engineering and domain randomization to succeed. In this paper, we systematically evaluate how retargeting quality affects policy performance when excessive reward tuning is suppressed. To address issues that we identify with existing retargeting methods, we propose a new retargeting method, General Motion Retargeting (GMR). We evaluate GMR alongside two open-source retargeters, PHC and ProtoMotions, as well as with a high-quality closed-source dataset from Unitree. Using BeyondMimic for policy training, we isolate retargeting effects without reward tuning. Our experiments on a diverse subset of the LAFAN1 dataset reveal that while most motions can be tracked, artifacts in retargeted data significantly reduce policy robustness, particularly for dynamic or long sequences. GMR consistently outperforms existing open-source methods in both tracking performance and faithfulness to the source motion, achieving perceptual fidelity and policy success rates close to the closed-source baseline.

| **[ExGRPO: Learning to Reason from Experience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02245v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.</p></details> |  |
| **[RewardMap: Tackling Sparse Rewards in Fine-grained Visual Reasoning via Multi-Stage Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02240v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover, models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Reasoning Boundary Paradox: How Reinforcement Learning Constrains Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02230v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/mail-research/SELF-llm-interference.</p></details> | 23 pages, 15 figures |
| **[More Than One Teacher: Adaptive Multi-Guidance Policy Optimization for Diverse Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02227v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover, AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend, thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability. Our code is available at https://github.com/SII-Enigma/AMPO.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

We first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy. Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only, obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and planning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Personalized Multi-Turn Dialogue with Curiosity Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03206v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective conversational agents like large language models (LLMs) must personalize their interactions to adapt to user preferences, personalities, and attributes across diverse domains like education and healthcare. Current methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often prioritize helpfulness and safety but fall short in fostering truly empathetic, adaptive, and personalized dialogues. Existing personalization approaches typically rely on extensive user history, limiting their effectiveness for new or context-limited users. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging a user model to incorporate a curiosity-based intrinsic reward into multi-turn RLHF. This novel reward mechanism encourages the LLM agent to actively infer user traits by optimizing conversations to improve its user model's accuracy. Consequently, the agent delivers more personalized interactions by learning more about the user. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two distinct domains: significantly improving personalization performance in a conversational recommendation task, and personalizing conversations for different learning styles in an educational setting. We show improved generalization capabilities compared to traditional multi-turn RLHF, all while maintaining conversation quality. Our method offers a promising solution for creating more personalized, adaptive, and engaging conversational agents.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in multi-task setups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Reason for Hallucination Span Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02173v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.</p></details> |  |
| **[RESTRAIN: From Spurious Votes to Signals -- Self-Driven RL with Self-Penalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02172v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO, enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data. With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to +140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels. These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward stronger reasoning without gold labels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning with Action-Triggered Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02149v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Gradient Guidance Enables Test Time Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02148v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update. Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$) consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable online reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Predictability of Reinforcement Learning Dynamics for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00553v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1 Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window, achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 28 figures; 43</p></details> |
| **[Accuracy of Discretely Sampled Stochastic Policies in Continuous-time Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09981v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic policies (also known as relaxed controls) are widely used in continuous-time reinforcement learning algorithms. However, executing a stochastic policy and evaluating its performance in a continuous-time environment remain open challenges. This work introduces and rigorously analyzes a policy execution framework that samples actions from a stochastic policy at discrete time points and implements them as piecewise constant controls. We prove that as the sampling mesh size tends to zero, the controlled state process converges weakly to the dynamics with coefficients aggregated according to the stochastic policy. We explicitly quantify the convergence rate based on the regularity of the coefficients and establish an optimal first-order convergence rate for sufficiently regular coefficients. Additionally, we prove a $1/2$-order weak convergence rate that holds uniformly over the sampling noise with high probability, and establish a $1/2$-order pathwise convergence for each realization of the system noise in the absence of volatility control. Building on these results, we analyze the bias and variance of various policy evaluation and policy gradient estimators based on discrete-time observations. Our results provide theoretical justification for the exploratory stochastic control framework in [H. Wang, T. Zariphopoulou, and X.Y. Zhou, J. Mach. Learn. Res., 21 (2020), pp. 1-34].</p></details> |  |

Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise, thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently, to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations, demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github Page: https://github.com/bcmi/Granular-GRPO</p></details> |

On the Dual Nature of Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25848v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models (LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems, it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories. Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of established benchmarks.

Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning, retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim verification.</p></details> |  |

While RLVR promises to improve reasoning by allowing models to learn from free exploration, there remains debate over whether it truly enhances reasoning abilities or simply boosts sampling efficiency. This paper systematically investigates the impact of RLVR on LLM reasoning. We revisit Pass@K experiments and demonstrate that RLVR can extend the reasoning boundary for both mathematical and coding tasks. This is supported by our introduction of a novel evaluation metric, CoT-Pass@K, which captures reasoning success by accounting for both the final answer and intermediate reasoning steps. Furthermore, we present a theoretical framework explaining RLVR's incentive mechanism, demonstrating how it can encourage correct reasoning even when rewards are based solely on answer correctness. Our analysis of RLVR's training dynamics reveals that it incentivizes correct reasoning early in the process, with substantial improvements in reasoning quality confirmed through extensive evaluations. These findings provide strong evidence of RLVR's potential to enhance LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights into its mechanisms and performance improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update with more experiments</p></details> |

The learned reasoning reward serves two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in language models.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions, whether traditional position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms, and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Plan Then Action:High-Level Planning Guidance Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01833v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL), attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge, we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks, validating its effectiveness and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |

Existing methods either lack generalization or are resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and resource-efficient web information extraction.</p></details> |  |

An Empirical Study and A Unified Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01830v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) is a critical component toward deploying mobile robots in everyday, uncontrolled environments such as homes, schools, and workplaces. In this context, a robot must locate target objects in previously unseen environments using only its onboard perception. Success requires the integration of semantic understanding, spatial reasoning, and long-horizon planning, which is a combination that remains extremely challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm, progress has spanned a wide range of design choices, yet the field still lacks a unifying analysis to determine which components truly drive performance. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of modular RL-based ObjectNav systems, decomposing them into three key components: perception, policy, and test-time enhancement. Through extensive controlled experiments, we isolate the contribution of each and uncover clear trends: perception quality and test-time strategies are decisive drivers of performance, whereas policy improvements with current methods yield only marginal gains. Building on these insights, we propose practical design guidelines and demonstrate an enhanced modular system that surpasses State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods by 6.6% on SPL and by a 2.7% success rate. We also introduce a human baseline under identical conditions, where experts achieve an average 98% success, underscoring the gap between RL agents and human-level navigation. Our study not only sets the SotA performance but also provides principled guidance for future ObjectNav development and evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization with Order-Invariant Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01824v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs, which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies, improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.</p></details> |  |
| **[An effective control of large systems of active particles: An application to evacuation problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19972v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulation of large systems of active particles is a serious challenge across diverse domains, including crowd management, control of robotic swarms, and coordinated material transport. The development of advanced control strategies for complex scenarios is hindered, however, by the lack of scalability and robustness of the existing methods, in particular, due to the need of an individual control for each agent. One possible solution involves controlling a system through a leader or a group of leaders, which other agents tend to follow. Using such an approach we develop an effective control strategy for a leader, combining reinforcement learning (RL) with artificial forces acting on the system. To describe the guidance of active particles by a leader we introduce the generalized Vicsek model. This novel method is then applied to the problem of the effective evacuation by a robot-rescuer (leader) of large groups of people from hazardous places. We demonstrate, that while a straightforward application of RL yields suboptimal results, even for advanced architectures, our approach provides a robust and efficient evacuation strategy. The source code supporting this study is publicly available at: https://github.com/cinemere/evacuation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-Time Bounds for Distributionally Robust TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01721v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD) learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to robust Q-learning with function approximation.</p></details> | Preprint. 32 Pages |

We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs, Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First, reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally, robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and experimental logs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing CNN and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding that captures both local details and global context while reducing computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to 2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media and design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Near-Optimal Sample Complexities of Divergence-based S-rectangular Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12202v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DR-RL) has recently gained significant attention as a principled approach that addresses discrepancies between training and testing environments. To balance robustness, conservatism, and computational traceability, the literature has introduced DR-RL models with SA-rectangular and S-rectangular adversaries. While most existing statistical analyses focus on SA-rectangular models, owing to their algorithmic simplicity and the optimality of deterministic policies, S-rectangular models more accurately capture distributional discrepancies in many real-world applications and often yield more effective robust randomized policies. In this paper, we study the empirical value iteration algorithm for divergence-based S-rectangular DR-RL and establish near-optimal sample complexity bounds of $\widetilde{O}(|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|(1-\gamma)^{-4}\varepsilon^{-2})$, where $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathcal{S}|$ and $|\mathcal{A}|$ denote the cardinalities of the state and action spaces, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first sample complexity results for divergence-based S-rectangular models that achieve optimal dependence on $|\mathcal{S}|$, $|\mathcal{A}|$, and $\varepsilon$ simultaneously. We further validate this theoretical dependence through numerical experiments on a robust inventory control problem and a theoretical worst-case example, demonstrating the fast learning performance of our proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in LLMS via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs, as measured by standard benchmarks. Yet these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards. This raises a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect genuine reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To answer this question, we adopt an evaluation-centric perspective and highlight two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, benchmark contamination arises because test problems are publicly available, thereby increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, evaluation fragility results from reliance on single-instance assessments, which are sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. These limitations suggest the need for a new evaluation paradigm that can probe reasoning ability beyond memorization and one-off success. As response, we propose VAR-MATH, a symbolic evaluation framework that converts fixed numerical problems into parameterized templates and requires models to solve multiple instantiations of each. This design enforces consistency across structurally equivalent variants, mitigates contamination, and enhances robustness through bootstrapped metrics. We apply VAR-MATH to transform three popular benchmarks, AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23, VAR-AIME24, and VAR-AIME25. Experimental results show substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on these variabilized benchmarks, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 47.9\% on AMC23, 58.8\% on AIME24, and 72.9\% on AIME25. These findings indicate that some existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms.</p></details> |  |

This is mainly due to information loss during image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by 66.5\% compared to the previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2 exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention - MICCAI 2025, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 15968</p></details> |

To address these challenges, researchers designed gaming agents using Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, or Large Language Models. However, these agents often neglect the diverse strategies employed by human players due to their different personalities, resulting in repetitive solutions in similar situations. Without mimicking varied gaming strategies, these agents struggle to trigger diverse in-game interactions or uncover edge cases. In this paper, we present MIMIC, a novel framework that integrates diverse personality traits into gaming agents, enabling them to adopt different gaming strategies for similar situations. By mimicking different playstyles, MIMIC can achieve higher test coverage and richer in-game interactions across different games. It also outperforms state-of-the-art agents in Minecraft by achieving a higher task completion rate and providing more diverse solutions. These results highlight MIMIC's significant potential for effective game testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables.

In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying lengths.

However, deriving these certificates for complex, unknown systems has traditionally required explicit knowledge of system dynamics, often making it a daunting task. This work introduces a novel framework that learns a Lyapunov function directly from trajectory data, enabling the certification of stability for autonomous systems without needing detailed system models. By parameterizing the Lyapunov candidate using a neural network and ensuring positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, our approach automatically identifies whether the system is stable under the given trajectory. To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow for controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining high confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate that this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a robust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic, real-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal control algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system behavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is open-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability.</p></details> |  |

While recent research has focused primarily on optimizing control policies for fixed robot structures, this position paper argues for evolving both control strategies and humanoid robots' physical structure under a co-design mechanism. Inspired by biological evolution, this approach enables robots to iteratively adapt both their form and behavior to optimize performance within task-specific and resource-constrained contexts. Despite its promise, co-design in humanoid robotics remains a relatively underexplored domain, raising fundamental questions about its feasibility and necessity in achieving true embodied intelligence. To address these challenges, we propose practical co-design methodologies grounded in strategic exploration, Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning. We further argue for the essential role of co-design by analyzing it from methodological, application-driven, and community-oriented perspectives. Striving to guide and inspire future studies, we present open research questions, spanning from short-term innovations to long-term goals. This work positions co-design as a cornerstone for developing the next generation of intelligent and adaptable humanoid agents.</p></details> |  |

The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system, and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are experimentally validated.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 13 figures, 1 table, Accepted 27 July 2025, Available online 16 Sept 2025, Version of Record 28 Sept 2025</p></details> |

A Correlation Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02941v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the integration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such systems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be considered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys, provide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to reproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation metrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks consensus on a standard set of metrics. This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific quantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as standardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results indicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation behavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and new metrics are necessary.</p></details> |  |

The proposed algorithm integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in obstacle avoidance. The source code is released for the reference of the robotics community.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, accepted to IROS2025</p></details> |
| **[Novel UWB Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging for Mobile Robot Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02874v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional exteroceptive sensors in mobile robots, such as LiDARs and cameras often struggle to perceive the environment in poor visibility conditions. Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have emerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse environmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small apertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed image of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large aperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The resulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition representation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a pipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an unknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature detectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB SAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental conditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection toward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the 15th International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN) 2025, see https://ipin-conference.org/2025/</p></details> |

In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target model and selectively skips communication and computation for server operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model only inference.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has highlighted the potential of data-driven technology in modeling the morphology and kinematics of robots. However, existing self-modeling methods suffer from either low modeling quality or excessive data acquisition costs. Beyond morphology and kinematics, texture is also a crucial component of robots, which is challenging to model and remains unexplored. In this work, a high-quality, texture-aware, and link-level method is proposed for robot self-modeling. We utilize three-dimensional (3D) Gaussians to represent the static morphology and texture of robots, and cluster the 3D Gaussians to construct neural ellipsoid bones, whose deformations are controlled by the transformation matrices generated by a kinematic neural network. The 3D Gaussians and kinematic neural network are trained using data pairs composed of joint angles, camera parameters and multi-view images without depth information. By feeding the kinematic neural network with joint angles, we can utilize the well-trained model to describe the corresponding morphology, kinematics and texture of robots at the link level, and render robot images from different perspectives with the aid of 3D Gaussian splatting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the established model can be exploited to perform downstream tasks such as motion planning and inverse kinematics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IJRR.

This process involves a team of collaborative robots maintaining a predefined geometric configuration, such as a square, while in motion. For untethered collaborative motion, inter-robot communication must be conducted through a wireless network. Notably, few existing works offer a comprehensive solution for multi-robot formation navigation executable on microprocessor platforms via wireless networks, particularly for formations that must traverse complex curvilinear paths. To address this gap, we introduce a novel "hold-and-hit" communication-control framework designed to work seamlessly with the widely-used Robotic Operating System (ROS) platform. The hold-and-hit framework synchronizes robot movements in a manner robust against wireless network delays and packet loss. It operates over discrete-time communication-control cycles, making it suitable for implementation on contemporary microprocessors. Complementary to hold-and-hit, we propose an intra-cycle optimization approach that enables rigid formations to closely follow desired curvilinear paths, even under the nonholonomic movement constraints inherent to most vehicular robots. The combination of hold-and-hit and intra-cycle optimization ensures precise and reliable navigation even in challenging scenarios. Simulations in a virtual environment demonstrate the superiority of our method in maintaining a four-robot square formation along an S-shaped path, outperforming two existing approaches. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework: the robots maintained an inter-distance error within $\pm 0.069m$ and an inter-angular orientation error within $\pm19.15^{\circ}$ while navigating along an S-shaped path at a fixed linear velocity of $0.1 m/s$.</p></details> |  |

We present U-LAG, a mid-execution goal-retargeting layer that leaves the low-level controller unchanged while re-aiming task goals (pre-contact, contact, post) as new observations arrive. Unlike motion retargeting or generic visual servoing, U-LAG treats in-flight goal re-aiming as a first-class, pluggable module between perception and control. Our main technical contribution is UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that maintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals that maximize expected progress. We instantiate a reproducible Shift x Lag stress test in PyBullet/PandaGym for pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion, where the object undergoes abrupt in-plane shifts while synthetic perception lag is injected during approach. Across 0-10 cm shifts and 0-400 ms lags, UAR-PF and ICP degrade gracefully relative to a no-retarget baseline, achieving higher success with modest end-effector travel and fewer aborts; simple operational safeguards further improve stability. Contributions: (1) UAR-PF for lag-adaptive, uncertainty-aware goal retargeting; (2) a pluggable retargeting interface; and (3) a reproducible Shift x Lag benchmark with evaluation on pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

In particular, we compare two machine-learning-based and two analytical algorithms using an existing benchmarking protocol from the literature and determine the algorithm's strengths and weaknesses under different experimental conditions. These conditions include variations in lighting, background textures, cameras with different noise levels, and grippers. We also run analogous experiments in simulations and with real robots and present the discrepancies. Some experiments are also run in two different laboratories using same protocols to further analyze the repeatability of our results. We believe that this study, comprising 5040 experiments, provides important insights into the role and challenges of systematic experimentation in robotic manipulation, and guides the development of new algorithms by considering the factors that could impact the performance.

| **[ERUPT: An Open Toolkit for Interfacing with Robot Motion Planners in Extended Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02464v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Extended Reality Universal Planning Toolkit (ERUPT), an extended reality (XR) system for interactive motion planning. Our system allows users to create and dynamically reconfigure environments while they plan robot paths. In immersive three-dimensional XR environments, users gain a greater spatial understanding. XR also unlocks a broader range of natural interaction capabilities, allowing users to grab and adjust objects in the environment similarly to the real world, rather than using a mouse and keyboard with the scene projected onto a two-dimensional computer screen. Our system integrates with MoveIt, a manipulation planning framework, allowing users to send motion planning requests and visualize the resulting robot paths in virtual or augmented reality. We provide a broad range of interaction modalities, allowing users to modify objects in the environment and interact with a virtual robot. Our system allows operators to visualize robot motions, ensuring desired behavior as it moves throughout the environment, without risk of collisions within a virtual space, and to then deploy planned paths on physical robots in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[SARM: Stage-Aware Reward Modeling for Long Horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25358v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale robot learning has recently shown promise for enabling robots to perform complex tasks by integrating perception, control, and language understanding. Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation such as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is inconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded progress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision that generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware, video-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task stages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from natural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation across variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index labeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our reward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building on it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters high-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts. Integrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83\% success on folding T-shirts from the flattened state and 67\% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing vanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8\% and 0\% success. Overall, our results highlight reward modeling as a key enabler for scalable, annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LangGrasp: Leveraging Fine-Tuned LLMs for Language Interactive Robot Grasping with Ambiguous Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02104v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existing language-driven grasping methods struggle to fully handle ambiguous instructions containing implicit intents. To tackle this challenge, we propose LangGrasp, a novel language-interactive robotic grasping framework. The framework integrates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to leverage their robust commonsense understanding and environmental perception capabilities, thereby deducing implicit intents from linguistic instructions and clarifying task requirements along with target manipulation objects. Furthermore, our designed point cloud localization module, guided by 2D part segmentation, enables partial point cloud localization in scenes, thereby extending grasping operations from coarse-grained object-level to fine-grained part-level manipulation. Experimental results show that the LangGrasp framework accurately resolves implicit intents in ambiguous instructions, identifying critical operations and target information that are unstated yet essential for task completion. Additionally, it dynamically selects optimal grasping poses by integrating environmental information. This enables high-precision grasping from object-level to part-level manipulation, significantly enhancing the adaptability and task execution efficiency of robots in unstructured environments.

| **[Physics-Constrained Robot Grasp Planning for Dynamic Tool Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01399v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool use requires not only selecting appropriate tools but also generating grasps and motions that remain stable under dynamic interactions. Existing approaches largely focus on high-level tool grounding or quasi-static manipulation, overlooking stability in dynamic and cluttered regimes. We introduce iTuP (inverse Tool-use Planning), a framework that outputs robot grasps explicitly tailored for tool use. iTuP integrates a physics-constrained grasp generator with a task-conditional scoring function to produce grasps that remain stable during dynamic tool interactions. These grasps account for manipulation trajectories, torque requirements, and slip prevention, enabling reliable execution of real-world tasks. Experiments across hammering, sweeping, knocking, and reaching tasks demonstrate that iTuP outperforms geometry-based and vision-language model (VLM)-based baselines in grasp stability and task success. Our results underscore that physics-constrained grasping is essential for robust robot tool use in quasi-static, dynamic, and cluttered environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission and under review</p></details> |
| **[VFP: Variational Flow-Matching Policy for Multi-Modal Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01622v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-matching-based policies have recently emerged as a promising approach for learning-based robot manipulation, offering significant acceleration in action sampling compared to diffusion-based policies. However, conventional flow-matching methods struggle with multi-modality, often collapsing to averaged or ambiguous behaviors in complex manipulation tasks. To address this, we propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a variational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively captures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further incorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level alignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode specialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41 simulated tasks and 3 real-robot tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and sampling efficiency in both simulated and real-world settings. Results show that VFP achieves a 49% relative improvement in task success rate over standard flow-based baselines in simulation, and further outperforms them on real-robot tasks, while still maintaining fast inference and a compact model size.

| **[SPARC: Spine with Prismatic and Revolute Compliance for Quadruped Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01984v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SPARC, a compact, open-source 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module that combines revolute (pitch) and prismatic (axial) motion with programmable task-space impedance for quadruped robots. The system integrates three torque-controlled actuators, a custom 1 kHz control board, and a protected power unit in a 1.26 kg package, enabling closed-loop stiffness and damping shaping along x, z, and theta. We develop an RNEA-based computed-acceleration controller with smooth Stribeck friction compensation to render spring-damper behavior without explicit inertia shaping. Bench experiments validate the approach. Quasi-static push-pull tests show linear force-displacement characteristics with commanded horizontal stiffness spanning 300-700 N/m and <= 1.5% relative error (R^2 >= 0.992, narrow 95% CIs). Dynamic displace-and-release trials confirm mass-spring-damper responses over multiple damping settings, with small, interpretable phase deviations due to configuration-dependent inertia and low-speed friction effects. A task-space PD controller produces roughly linear stiffness but with greater variability and coupling sensitivity. SPARC provides a portable platform for systematic studies of spine compliance in legged locomotion and will be released with complete hardware and firmware resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Software Engineering for Self-Adaptive Robotics: A Research Agenda](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19629v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-adaptive robotic systems operate autonomously in dynamic and uncertain environments, requiring robust real-time monitoring and adaptive behaviour. Unlike traditional robotic software with predefined logic, self-adaptive robots exploit artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and model-driven engineering to adapt continuously to changing conditions, thereby ensuring reliability, safety, and optimal performance. This paper presents a research agenda for software engineering in self-adaptive robotics, structured along two dimensions. The first concerns the software engineering lifecycle, requirements, design, development, testing, and operations, tailored to the challenges of self-adaptive robotics. The second focuses on enabling technologies such as digital twins, AI-driven adaptation, and quantum computing, which support runtime monitoring, fault detection, and automated decision-making. We identify open challenges, including verifying adaptive behaviours under uncertainty, balancing trade-offs between adaptability, performance, and safety, and integrating self-adaptation frameworks like MAPE-K/MAPLE-K. By consolidating these challenges into a roadmap toward 2030, this work contributes to the foundations of trustworthy and efficient self-adaptive robotic systems capable of meeting the complexities of real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

Social Identity, Robot Errors and Blame Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01862v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper argues that conventional blame practices fall short of capturing the complexity of moral experiences, neglecting power dynamics and discriminatory social practices. It is evident that robots, embodying roles linked to specific social groups, pose a risk of reinforcing stereotypes of how these groups behave or should behave, so they set a normative and descriptive standard. In addition, we argue that faulty robots might create expectations of who is supposed to compensate and repair after their errors, where social groups that are already disadvantaged might be blamed disproportionately if they do not act according to their ascribed roles. This theoretical and empirical gap becomes even more urgent to address as there have been indications of potential carryover effects from Human-Robot Interactions (HRI) to Human-Human Interactions (HHI). We therefore urge roboticists and designers to stay in an ongoing conversation about how social traits are conceptualised and implemented in this technology. We also argue that one solution could be to 'embrace the glitch' and to focus on constructively disrupting practices instead of prioritizing efficiency and smoothness of interaction above everything else. Apart from considering ethical aspects in the design phase of social robots, we see our analysis as a call for more research on the consequences of robot stereotyping and blame attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of Robophilosophy 2024.

Recent advances in radiance field methods, such as Gaussian splatting, enable photorealistic reconstruction but have so far been restricted to individual plants or controlled laboratory conditions. In this work, we introduce GreenhouseSplat, a framework and dataset for generating photorealistic greenhouse assets directly from inexpensive RGB images. The resulting assets are integrated into a ROS-based simulation with support for camera and LiDAR rendering, enabling tasks such as localization with fiducial markers. We provide a dataset of 82 cucumber plants across multiple row configurations and demonstrate its utility for robotics evaluation. GreenhouseSplat represents the first step toward greenhouse-scale radiance-field simulation and offers a foundation for future research in agricultural robotics.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions, whether traditional position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms, and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

Unlike traditional robots in manufacturing or logistics, these robots must navigate complex human environments where maintaining appropriate physical and psychological distances is crucial for seamless interaction. This study explores the application of proxemics in human-robot interactions, focusing specifically on quadruped robots, which present unique challenges and opportunities due to their lifelike movement and form. Utilizing a motion capture system, we examine how different interaction postures of a canine robot influence human participants' proxemic behavior in dynamic scenarios. By capturing and analyzing position and orientation data, this research aims to identify key factors that affect proxemic distances and inform the design of socially acceptable robots. The findings underscore the importance of adhering to human psychological and physical distancing norms in robot design, ensuring that autonomous systems can coexist harmoniously with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

To expand deformation capabilities, this paper presents a simple assembly that embeds permanent magnets radially within the catheter wall, allowing a single externally steered permanent magnet to independently induce either bending or torsion. A physics-based formulation together with finite-element analysis establishes the actuation principles, and benchtop experiments validate decoupled mode control under practical fields. Building on this, a dual-layer blockage mechanism consisting of outer grooves and inner plates leverages torsional shear to achieve on-demand drug release. Finally, an in-phantom intervention experiment demonstrates end-to-end operation: lumen following by bending for target approach, followed by twist-activated release at the site. The resulting compact, cable-free platform combines versatile deformation with precise payload delivery, indicating strong potential for next-generation, site-specific therapies.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, under review of ICRA 2026</p></details> |

Our framework combines Chaos Game Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making, this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation in genomic medicine.</p></details> |  |

ActiveUMI couples a portable VR teleoperation kit with sensorized controllers that mirror the robot's end-effectors, bridging human-robot kinematics via precise pose alignment. To ensure mobility and data quality, we introduce several key techniques, including immersive 3D model rendering, a self-contained wearable computer, and efficient calibration methods. ActiveUMI's defining feature is its capture of active, egocentric perception. By recording an operator's deliberate head movements via a head-mounted display, our system learns the crucial link between visual attention and manipulation. We evaluate ActiveUMI on six challenging bimanual tasks. Policies trained exclusively on ActiveUMI data achieve an average success rate of 70\% on in-distribution tasks and demonstrate strong generalization, retaining a 56\% success rate when tested on novel objects and in new environments. Our results demonstrate that portable data collection systems, when coupled with learned active perception, provide an effective and scalable pathway toward creating generalizable and highly capable real-world robot policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>techn...</summary><p>technique report.

| **[Safe Navigation of Bipedal Robots via Koopman Operator-Based Model Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14736v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinearity in dynamics has long been a major challenge in robotics, often causing significant performance degradation in existing control algorithms. For example, the navigation of bipedal robots can exhibit nonlinear behaviors even under simple velocity commands, as their actual dynamics are governed by complex whole-body movements and discrete contacts. In this work, we propose a novel safe navigation framework inspired by Koopman operator theory. We first train a low-level locomotion policy using deep reinforcement learning, and then capture its low-frequency, base-level dynamics by learning linearized dynamics in a high-dimensional lifted space using Dynamic Mode Decomposition. Then, our model-predictive controller (MPC) efficiently optimizes control signals via standard quadratic objective and the linear dynamics constraint in the lifted space. We demonstrate that the Koopman-based model more accurately predicts bipedal robot trajectories than baseline approaches. Furthermore, we show that the proposed navigation framework achieves improved safety with better success rates in dense environments with narrow passages.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Existing online planar mapping approaches struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency: direct depth image segmentation from specific sensors suffers from poor temporal integration, height map-based methods cannot represent complex 3D structures like overhangs, and voxel-based plane segmentation remains unexplored for real-time applications. To address these limitations, we develop a novel framework that integrates vertex-based connected component labeling with random sample consensus based plane detection and convex hull, leveraging GPU parallel computing to rapidly extract planar regions from point clouds accumulated in high-resolution 3D voxel maps. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fast and accurate 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz update rate even at a resolution of 0.01 m, enabling the detected planes to be utilized in real time for locomotion tasks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments in both simulated environments and physical legged robot platforms, confirming robust locomotion performance when considering 3D planar structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 12 figures, This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

The existing approaches, such as traditional sampling-based methods, struggle with resolution control and scalability, while imitation learning-based methods require a large amount of demonstration data. Active Neural Time Fields (ANTFields) have recently emerged as a promising solution by using local observations to learn cost-to-go functions without relying on demonstrations. Despite their potential, these methods are hampered by challenges such as spectral bias and catastrophic forgetting, which diminish their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these issues, our approach decomposes the planning problem into a hierarchical structure. At the high level, a sparse graph captures the environment's global connectivity, while at the low level, a planner based on neural fields navigates local obstacles by solving the Eikonal PDE. This physics-informed strategy overcomes common pitfalls like spectral bias and neural field fitting difficulties, resulting in a smooth and precise representation of the cost landscape. We validate our framework in large-scale environments, demonstrating its enhanced adaptability and precision compared to previous methods, and highlighting its potential for online exploration, mapping, and real-world navigation.</p></details> |  |

Through a proof-of-concept hardware experiment and offline Kalman filter analysis, we show that the robot's pose can be reliably estimated. State estimation is performed using an unscented Kalman filter augmented with Gaussian process residual learning to compensate for non-zero-mean, non-Gaussian noise. We further show that a filter trained on a multi-gait dataset (forward, backward, left, right, and turning) performs comparably to one trained on a larger forward-gait-only dataset when both are evaluated on the same forward-gait test trajectory. These results reveal overlap in the gait input space, which can be exploited to reduce training data requirements while enhancing the filter's generalizability across multiple gaits.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, applying MARL to robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware experiments.</p></details> |  |

Existing keypoint-based approaches can focus on manipulation-centric features and be lightweight, but either depend on manual heuristics or task-coupled selection, limiting scalability and semantic understanding. To address this, we propose AFFORD2ACT, an affordance-guided framework that distills a minimal set of semantic 2D keypoints from a text prompt and a single image. AFFORD2ACT follows a three-stage pipeline: affordance filtering, category-level keypoint construction, and transformer-based policy learning with embedded gating to reason about the most relevant keypoints, yielding a compact 38-dimensional state policy that can be trained in 15 minutes, which performs well in real-time without proprioception or dense representations. Across diverse real-world manipulation tasks, AFFORD2ACT consistently improves data efficiency, achieving an 82% success rate on unseen objects, novel categories, backgrounds, and distractors.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art methods often rely on collision-cone or velocity-obstacle constraints which, by only considering the angle of the relative velocity, are inherently conservative and can render the CBF-based quadratic program infeasible, particularly in dense scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Parabolic Control Barrier Function (DPCBF) that defines the safe set using a parabolic boundary. The parabola's vertex and curvature dynamically adapt based on both the distance to an obstacle and the magnitude of the relative velocity, creating a less restrictive safety constraint. We prove that the proposed DPCBF is valid for a kinematic bicycle model subject to input constraints. Extensive comparative simulations demonstrate that our DPCBF-based controller significantly enhances navigation success rates and QP feasibility compared to baseline methods.

| **[A Stochastic Framework for Continuous-Time State Estimation of Continuum Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01381v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation techniques for continuum robots (CRs) typically involve using computationally complex dynamic models, simplistic shape approximations, or are limited to quasi-static methods. These limitations can be sensitive to unmodelled disturbances acting on the robot. Inspired by a factor-graph optimization paradigm, this work introduces a continuous-time stochastic state estimation framework for continuum robots. We introduce factors based on continuous-time kinematics that are corrupted by a white noise Gaussian process (GP). By using a simple robot model paired with high-rate sensing, we show adaptability to unmodelled external forces and data dropout. The result contains an estimate of the mean and covariance for the robot's pose, velocity, and strain, each of which can be interpolated continuously in time or space. This same interpolation scheme can be used during estimation, allowing for inclusion of measurements on states that are not explicitly estimated. Our method's inherent sparsity leads to a linear solve complexity with respect to time and interpolation queries in constant time. We demonstrate our method on a CR with gyroscope and pose sensors, highlighting its versatility in real-world systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures.

In this work, we address both limitations within an imitation learning framework. First, we shift the typical role of Curriculum Learning in MRS, from scalability with the number of robots, to focus on improving long-term coordination. We propose a curriculum strategy that gradually increases the length of expert trajectories during training, stabilizing learning and enhancing the accuracy of long-term behaviors. Second, we introduce a method to approximate the egocentric perception of each robot using only third-person global state demonstrations. Our approach transforms idealized trajectories into locally available observations by filtering neighbors, converting reference frames, and simulating onboard sensor variability. Both contributions are integrated into a physics-informed technique to produce scalable, distributed policies from observations. We conduct experiments across two tasks with varying team sizes and noise levels. Results show that our curriculum improves long-term accuracy, while our perceptual estimation method yields policies that are robust to realistic uncertainty. Together, these strategies enable the learning of robust, distributed controllers from global demonstrations, even in the absence of expert actions or onboard measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the Eight Iberian Robotics Conference, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Real-Time Trajectory Generation and Hybrid Lyapunov-Based Control for Hopping Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01138v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of rotor-based hopping robots has created very capable hopping platforms with high agility and efficiency, and similar controllability, as compared to their purely flying quadrotor counterparts. Advances in robot performance have increased the hopping height to greater than 4 meters and opened up the possibility for more complex aerial trajectories (i.e., behaviors). However, currently hopping robots do not directly control their aerial trajectory or transition to flight, eliminating the efficiency benefits of a hopping system. Here we show a real-time, computationally efficiency, non-linear drag compensated, trajectory generation methodology and accompanying Lyapunov-based controller. The combined system can create and follow complex aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown on horizontal and vertical surfaces, while maintaining strick control over the orientation at touchdown. The computational efficiency provides broad applicability across all size scales of hopping robots while maintaining applicability to quadrotors in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Improving Diffusion-based or Flow-based Robot Policies via Test-time Distribution-level Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01068v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action (VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging existing policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sagecao1125.github.io/GPC-Site/</p></details> |

The framework strategically selects visual features using a Mean Squared Error (MSE)-based, non-submodular objective function and a simplified dynamic anticipation model. To address the NP-hardness of this problem, we introduce four polynomial-time approximation algorithms: a classic greedy method with constant-factor guarantees; a low-rank greedy variant that significantly reduces computational complexity; a randomized greedy sampler that balances efficiency and solution quality; and a linearization-based selector based on a first-order Taylor expansion for near-constant-time execution. We establish rigorous performance bounds by leveraging submodularity ratios, curvature, and element-wise curvature analyses. Extensive experiments on both standardized benchmarks and a custom control-aware platform validate our theoretical results, demonstrating that these methods achieve strong approximation guarantees while enabling real-time deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages; Accepted to appear in IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)</p></details> |

However, state estimation for these robots is challenging due to the lack of rigid-body assumptions and kinematic changes from morphing. We propose a method to estimate typical rigid-body states alongside compliance-related states, such as soft robot shape in different morphologies and locomotion modes. Our neural network-based state estimator uses a history of states and a mechanism to directly influence unreliable sensors. We test our framework on the GOAT platform, a robot capable of passive compliance and active morphing for extreme outdoor terrain. The network is trained on motion capture data in a novel compliance-centric frame that accounts for morphing-related states. Our method predicts shape-related measurements within 4.2% of the robot's size, velocities within 6.3% and 2.4% of the top linear and angular speeds, respectively, and orientation within 1.5 degrees. We also demonstrate a 300% increase in travel range during a motor malfunction when using our estimator for closed-loop autonomous outdoor operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, 1 table, preprint</p></details> |

While incorporating historical context through attention mechanisms can improve robustness, standard approaches process all past states in a sequence without explicitly modeling the temporal structure that demonstrations may include, such as failure and recovery patterns. We propose a Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer that employs a novel State Transition Attention (STA) mechanism to modulate standard attention weights based on learned state evolution patterns, enabling policies to better adapt their behavior based on execution history. Our approach combines this structured attention with temporal masking during training, where visual information is randomly removed from recent timesteps to encourage temporal reasoning from historical context. Evaluation in simulation shows that STA consistently outperforms standard cross-attention and temporal modeling approaches like TCN and LSTM networks across all tasks, achieving more than 2x improvement over cross-attention on precision-critical tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/iit-DLSLab/croSTAta</p></details> |

The ability to perceive human psycho-physical states, such as stress and cognitive load, is crucial for adaptive and human-aware robotics. This paper introduces MultiPhysio-HRC, a multimodal dataset containing physiological, audio, and facial data collected during real-world HRC scenarios. The dataset includes electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), respiration (RESP), electromyography (EMG), voice recordings, and facial action units. The dataset integrates controlled cognitive tasks, immersive virtual reality experiences, and industrial disassembly activities performed manually and with robotic assistance, to capture a holistic view of the participants' mental states. Rich ground truth annotations were obtained using validated psychological self-assessment questionnaires. Baseline models were evaluated for stress and cognitive load classification, demonstrating the dataset's potential for affective computing and human-aware robotics research.

However, existing robot learning algorithms, especially learn-from-demonstration methods, still struggle to handle diverse and dynamic food states, which often results in spillage and reduced reliability. In this work, we introduce GRITS: A Spillage-Aware Guided Diffusion Policy for Robot Food Scooping Tasks. This framework leverages guided diffusion policy to minimize food spillage during scooping and to ensure reliable transfer of food items from the initial to the target location. Specifically, we design a spillage predictor that estimates the probability of spillage given current observation and action rollout. The predictor is trained on a simulated dataset with food spillage scenarios, constructed from four primitive shapes (spheres, cubes, cones, and cylinders) with varied physical properties such as mass, friction, and particle size. At inference time, the predictor serves as a differentiable guidance signal, steering the diffusion sampling process toward safer trajectories while preserving task success. We validate GRITS on a real-world robotic food scooping platform. GRITS is trained on six food categories and evaluated on ten unseen categories with different shapes and quantities. GRITS achieves an 82% task success rate and a 4% spillage rate, reducing spillage by over 40% compared to baselines without guidance, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

The practical quality of these solutions, however, critically depends on rounding them to rank-1 matrices, a condition that can be challenging to achieve. In this work, we focus on trace-constrained SDPs (TCSDPs), where the decision variables are Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) matrices with fixed trace values. We show that the latter can be used to design a gradient-based refinement procedure that projects relaxed SDP solutions toward rank-1, low-cost candidates. We also provide fixed-trace SDP relaxations for common robotic quantities, such as rotations and translations, and a modular virtual robot abstraction that simplifies modeling across different problem settings. We demonstrate that our trace-constrained SDP framework can be applied to many robotics tasks, and we showcase its effectiveness through simulations in Perspective-n-Point (PnP) estimation, hand-eye calibration, and dual-robot system calibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to American Control Conference (ACC) 2026</p></details> |

While human videos offer a scalable alternative, effectively transferring manipulation knowledge is fundamentally hindered by the significant morphological gap between human and robotic embodiments. To address this challenge and facilitate skill transfer from human to robot, we introduce Traj2Action,a novel framework that bridges this embodiment gap by using the 3D trajectory of the operational endpoint as a unified intermediate representation, and then transfers the manipulation knowledge embedded in this trajectory to the robot's actions. Our policy first learns to generate a coarse trajectory, which forms an high-level motion plan by leveraging both human and robot data. This plan then conditions the synthesis of precise, robot-specific actions (e.g., orientation and gripper state) within a co-denoising framework. Extensive real-world experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate that Traj2Action boosts the performance by up to 27% and 22.25% over $\pi_0$ baseline on short- and long-horizon real-world tasks, and achieves significant gains as human data scales in robot policy learning.

However, inherent uncertainties in pedestrian behavior and limited environmental interaction during training often lead to suboptimal exploration and distributional shifts between offline training and online deployment. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel offline-to-online fine-tuning RL algorithm for robot social navigation by integrating Return-to-Go (RTG) prediction into a causal Transformer architecture. Our algorithm features a spatiotem-poral fusion model designed to precisely estimate RTG values in real-time by jointly encoding temporal pedestrian motion patterns and spatial crowd dynamics. This RTG prediction framework mitigates distribution shift by aligning offline policy training with online environmental interactions. Furthermore, a hybrid offline-online experience sampling mechanism is built to stabilize policy updates during fine-tuning, ensuring balanced integration of pre-trained knowledge and real-time adaptation. Extensive experiments in simulated social navigation environments demonstrate that our method achieves a higher success rate and lower collision rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results underscore the efficacy of our algorithm in enhancing navigation policy robustness and adaptability. This work paves the way for more reliable and adaptive robotic navigation systems in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing model-based and bio-inspired controllers rely on simplified assumptions that limit performance. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently emerged as a promising alternative, but online training is often impractical because of costly and potentially damaging real-world interactions. Offline RL provides a safer option by leveraging pre-collected datasets, but it suffers from distribution shift, which degrades generalization to unseen scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose DiSA-IQL (Distribution-Shift-Aware Implicit Q-Learning), an extension of IQL that incorporates robustness modulation by penalizing unreliable state-action pairs to mitigate distribution shift. We evaluate DiSA-IQL on goal-reaching tasks across two settings: in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluation. Simulation results show that DiSA-IQL consistently outperforms baseline models, including Behavior Cloning (BC), Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), and vanilla IQL, achieving higher success rates, smoother trajectories, and improved robustness. The codes are open-sourced to support reproducibility and to facilitate further research in offline RL for soft robot control.</p></details> |  |

On the other hand, implicit communication contributes to tacit and smooth interaction, making it more suitable for teaming, but requires inference for interpretation. This paper studies a novel type of implicit visual communication (IVC) using shadows via visual projection with augmented reality, referred to as active shadowing (ASD). Prior IVC methods, such as legible motion, are often used to influence the perception of robot behavior to make it more understandable. They often require changing the physical robot behavior, resulting in suboptimality. In our work, we investigate how ASD can be used to achieve similar effects without losing optimality. Our evaluations with user studies demonstrates that ASD can effectively creates ''illusions'' that maintain optimal physical behavior without compromising its understandability. We also show that ASD can be more informative than other explicit communication methods, and examine the conditions under which ASD becomes less effective.</p></details> |  |

Most current approaches follow an open-loop paradigm with limited reasoning and no feedback, resulting in poor robustness to environmental changes and severe error accumulation. We present RoboPilot, a dual-thinking closed-loop framework for robotic manipulation that supports adaptive reasoning for complex tasks in real-world dynamic environments. RoboPilot leverages primitive actions for structured task planning and flexible action generation, while introducing feedback to enable replanning from dynamic changes and execution errors. Chain-of-Thought reasoning further enhances high-level task planning and guides low-level action generation. The system dynamically switches between fast and slow thinking to balance efficiency and accuracy. To systematically evaluate the robustness of RoboPilot in diverse robot manipulation scenarios, we introduce RoboPilot-Bench, a benchmark spanning 21 tasks across 10 categories, including infeasible-task recognition and failure recovery. Experiments show that RoboPilot outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25.9\% in task success rate, and the real-world deployment on an industrial robot further demonstrates its robustness in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLA: A Multisensory Language-Action Model for Multimodal Understanding and Forecasting in Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26642v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs) and learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images, 3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex, contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved generalization to unseen configurations.

However, most prior LLM-based work in robotic applications either directly predicts waypoints or applies LLMs within fixed tool integration frameworks, offering limited flexibility in exploring and configuring solutions best suited to different tasks. In this work, we propose a framework that leverages LLMs to select appropriate planning and control strategies based on task descriptions, environmental constraints, and system dynamics. These strategies are then executed by calling the available comprehensive planning and control APIs. Our approach employs iterative LLM-based reasoning with performance feedback to refine the algorithm selection. We validate our approach through extensive experiments across tasks of varying complexity, from simple tracking to complex planning scenarios involving spatiotemporal constraints. The results demonstrate that using LLMs to determine planning and control strategies from natural language descriptions significantly enhances robotic autonomy while reducing the need for extensive manual tuning and expert knowledge. Furthermore, our framework maintains generalizability across different tasks and notably outperforms baseline methods that rely on LLMs for direct trajectory, control sequence, or code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 14 figures, submitted to the 2026 American Control Conference</p></details> |

This work proposes a multi-robot UGV-UAV localization system that leverages the two technologies with inexpensive and readily-available sensors, such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and wheel encoders, to estimate the relative position of an aerial robot with respect to a ground robot. The first stage of the system pipeline includes a nonlinear optimization framework to trilaterate the location of the aerial platform based on UWB range data, and a radar pre-processing module with loosely coupled ego-motion estimation which has been adapted for a multi-robot scenario. Then, the pre-processed radar data as well as the relative transformation are fed to a pose-graph optimization framework with odometry and inter-robot constraints. The system, implemented for the Robotic Operating System (ROS 2) with the Ceres optimizer, has been validated in Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulations and in a real-world dataset. The proposed relative localization module outperforms state-of-the-art closed-form methods which are less robust to noise. Our SITL environment includes a custom Gazebo plugin for generating realistic UWB measurements modeled after real data. Conveniently, the proposed factor graph formulation makes the system readily extensible to full Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). Finally, all the code and experimental data is publicly available to support reproducibility and to serve as a common open dataset for benchmarking.</p></details> |  |

Traditional formation control techniques often rely on time-parameterized trajectories and path integrals, which can result in synchronization issues and rigid behavior. In this work, we address the problem of sequential path following, where agents maintain fixed spatial separation along a common trajectory, guided by a leader under centralized control. We introduce Robot Conga, a leader-follower control strategy that updates each agent's desired state based on the leader's spatial displacement rather than time, assuming access to a global position reference, an assumption valid in indoor environments equipped with motion capture, vision-based tracking, or UWB localization systems. The algorithm was validated in simulation using both TurtleBot3 and quadruped (Laikago) robots. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, stable inter-agent spacing, and fast convergence, with all agents aligning within 250 time steps (approx. 0.25 seconds) in the quadruped case, and almost instantaneously in the TurtleBot3 implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 8 Figures.

These methods rely on image-based representations of target shapes to compute local density gradients and perform mean-shift exploration, which constitute their core mechanism. However, such image representations incur substantial memory overhead, which can become prohibitive for high-resolution or 3D shapes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a memory-efficient tree map representation that hierarchically encodes user-specified shapes and is applicable to both 2D and 3D scenarios. Building on this representation, we design a behavior-based distributed controller that enables assignment-free shape assembly. Comparative 2D and 3D simulations against a state-of-the-art mean-shift algorithm demonstrate one to two orders of magnitude lower memory usage and two to three times faster shape entry while maintaining comparable uniformity. Finally, we validate the framework through physical experiments with 6 to 7 UAVs, confirming its real-world practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kinodynamic Motion Planning for Mobile Robot Navigation across Inconsistent World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26339v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile ground robots lacking prior knowledge of an environment must rely on sensor data to develop a model of their surroundings. In these scenarios, consistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult due to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for motion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to overcome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as obstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential solution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for the planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a history of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world models, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to reroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major iterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search for every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world models. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively, defer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH uses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each world. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic solutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than one-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment. Analysis of results from a field experiment in an unstructured, off-road environment on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog UGV indicate that GEGRH finds lower cost trajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH. Compared to single-hypothesis (SH) search, where only the latest world model is considered, GEGRH generates more conservative plans with a small increase in average planning time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025 Workshop on Resilient Off-road Autonomous Robotics (ROAR)</p></details> |

Drawing on early cybernetics, rule-based conceptual art, and seminal robotic works, it orchestrates fluid exchanges among robotic arms, quadruped machines, their environment, and the public. A three tier faith system pilots the ecology: micro-level adaptive tactics, meso-level narrative drives, and a macro-level prime directive. This hierarchy lets behaviors evolve organically in response to environmental cues and even a viewer's breath, turning spectators into co-authors of the unfolding drama. Framed by a speculative terraforming scenario that recalls the historical exploitation of marginalized labor, the piece asks who bears responsibility in AI-mediated futures. Choreographed motion, AI-generated scripts, reactive lighting, and drifting fog cast the robots as collaborators rather than tools, forging a living, emergent artwork.

Traditional approaches often rely on greedy frontier assignment strategies with limited inter-robot coordination. In this work, we introduce LLM-MCoX (LLM-based Multi-robot Coordinated Exploration and Search), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent coordination of both homogeneous and heterogeneous robot teams tasked with efficient exploration and target object search. Our approach combines real-time LiDAR scan processing for frontier cluster extraction and doorway detection with multimodal LLM reasoning (e.g., GPT-4o) to generate coordinated waypoint assignments based on shared environment maps and robot states. LLM-MCoX demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, including greedy and Voronoi-based planners, achieving 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% improved search efficiency in large environments with 6 robots. Notably, LLM-MCoX enables natural language-based object search capabilities, allowing human operators to provide high-level semantic guidance that traditional algorithms cannot interpret.</p></details> |  |

Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD to time series data in specific robotic tasks, but its transferability across control strategies and task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their broad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high temporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency. We examine three industrial robotic tasks, each presenting several anomalies. Test scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and multimodal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are compared, evaluating generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion policy, position, and impedance control). This allows us to validate the integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 in failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.</p></details> |  |
| **[ISyHand: A Dexterous Multi-finger Robot Hand with an Articulated Palm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26236v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid increase in the development of humanoid robots and customized manufacturing solutions has brought dexterous manipulation to the forefront of modern robotics. Over the past decade, several expensive dexterous hands have come to market, but advances in hardware design, particularly in servo motors and 3D printing, have recently facilitated an explosion of cheaper open-source hands. Most hands are anthropomorphic to allow use of standard human tools, and attempts to increase dexterity often sacrifice anthropomorphism. We introduce the open-source ISyHand (pronounced easy-hand), a highly dexterous, low-cost, easy-to-manufacture, on-joint servo-driven robot hand. Our hand uses off-the-shelf Dynamixel motors, fasteners, and 3D-printed parts, can be assembled within four hours, and has a total material cost of about 1,300 USD. The ISyHands's unique articulated-palm design increases overall dexterity with only a modest sacrifice in anthropomorphism. To demonstrate the utility of the articulated palm, we use reinforcement learning in simulation to train the hand to perform a classical in-hand manipulation task: cube reorientation. Our novel, systematic experiments show that the simulated ISyHand outperforms the two most comparable hands in early training phases, that all three perform similarly well after policy convergence, and that the ISyHand significantly outperforms a fixed-palm version of its own design. Additionally, we deploy a policy trained on cube reorientation on the real hand, demonstrating its ability to perform real-world dexterous manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Humanoids 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods often suffer from pose drift due to their ignorance of terrain geometry. We propose a terrain-awared LiDAR-Inertial odometry (LIO) framework that approximates the terrain using Radial Basis Functions (RBF) whose centers are adaptively selected and weights are recursively updated. The resulting smooth terrain manifold enables ``soft constraints" that regularize the odometry optimization and mitigates the $z$-axis pose drift under abrupt elevation changes during robot's maneuver. To ensure the LIO's real-time performance, we further evaluate the RBF-related terms and calculate the inverse of the sparse kernel matrix with GPU parallelization. Experiments on unstructured terrains demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art baselines, especially in the scenarios that have continuous height changes or sparse features when abrupt height changes occur.</p></details> |  |

The chassis provides an adjustable track width of 1.42 m to 1.57 m, along with a ground clearance of 0.94 m. The AgriCruiser achieves compact pivot turns with radii of 0.71 m to 0.79 m, enabling efficient headland maneuvers. The platform is designed for the integration of the other subsystems, and in this study, a precision spraying system was implemented to assess its effectiveness in weed management. In twelve flax plots, a single robotic spray pass reduced total weed populations (pigweed and Venice mallow) by 24- to 42-fold compared to manual weeding in four flax plots, while also causing less crop damage. Mobility experiments conducted on concrete, asphalt, gravel, grass, and both wet and dry soil confirmed reliable traversal consistent with torque sizing. The complete chassis can be constructed from commodity T-slot extrusion with minimal machining, resulting in a bill of materials costing approximately $5,000 - $6,000, which enables replication and customization. The mentioned results demonstrate that low-cost, reconfigurable over-the-row robots can achieve effective weed management with reduced crop damage and labor requirements, while providing a versatile foundation for phenotyping, sensing, and other agriculture applications. Design files and implementation details are released to accelerate research and adoption of modular agricultural robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub: https://github.com/structuresComp/agri-cruiser</p></details> |

This study addresses the challenging problem of determining which robot should be assigned to which part of a task when each robot possesses different situational on-site knowledge-specifically, spatial concepts learned from the area designated to it by the user. We propose a task planning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and spatial concepts to decompose natural language instructions into subtasks and allocate them to multiple robots. We designed a novel few-shot prompting strategy that enables LLMs to infer required objects from ambiguous commands and decompose them into appropriate subtasks. In our experiments, the proposed method achieved 47/50 successful assignments, outperforming random (28/50) and commonsense-based assignment (26/50). Furthermore, we conducted qualitative evaluations using two actual mobile manipulators. The results demonstrated that our framework could handle instructions, including those involving ad hoc categories such as "Get ready for a field trip," by successfully performing task decomposition, assignment, sequential planning, and execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AROB-ISBC 2026 (Journal Track option)</p></details> |

Within a simulated hospital environment, the system adopts a leader-follower swarm configuration to perform patient monitoring, medicine delivery, and emergency assistance. Due to ethical constraints, live patient trials were not conducted; instead, validation was carried out through controlled self-testing with wearable sensors. The Leader Robot acquires key physiological parameters, including temperature, SpO2, heart rate, and fall detection, and coordinates other robots when required. The Assistant Robot patrols corridors for medicine delivery, while a robotic arm provides direct drug administration. The swarm-inspired leader-follower strategy enhanced communication reliability and ensured continuous monitoring, including automated email alerts to healthcare staff. The system hardware was implemented using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, NRF24L01 RF modules, and a HuskyLens AI camera. Experimental evaluation showed an overall sensor accuracy above 94%, a 92% task-level success rate, and a 96% communication reliability rate, demonstrating system robustness. Furthermore, the AI-enabled decision support was able to provide early warnings of abnormal health conditions, highlighting the potential of the system as a cost-effective solution for hospital automation and patient safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, MSc dissertation submission draft, prepared for conference/journal consideration</p></details> |
| **[ADPro: a Test-time Adaptive Diffusion Policy via Manifold-constrained Denoising and Task-aware Initialization for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06266v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have recently emerged as a powerful class of visuomotor controllers for robot manipulation, offering stable training and expressive multi-modal action modeling. However, existing approaches typically treat action generation as an unconstrained denoising process, ignoring valuable a priori knowledge about geometry and control structure. In this work, we propose the Adaptive Diffusion Policy (ADP), a test-time adaptation method that introduces two key inductive biases into the diffusion. First, we embed a geometric manifold constraint that aligns denoising updates with task-relevant subspaces, leveraging the fact that the relative pose between the end-effector and target scene provides a natural gradient direction, and guiding denoising along the geodesic path of the manipulation manifold. Then, to reduce unnecessary exploration and accelerate convergence, we propose an analytically guided initialization: rather than sampling from an uninformative prior, we compute a rough registration between the gripper and target scenes to propose a structured initial noisy action. ADP is compatible with pre-trained diffusion policies and requires no retraining, enabling test-time adaptation that tailors the policy to specific tasks, thereby enhancing generalization across novel tasks and environments. Experiments on RLBench, CALVIN, and real-world datasets show that ADPro, an implementation of ADP, improves success rates, generalization, and sampling efficiency, achieving up to 25% faster execution and 9% points over strong diffusion baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emotionally Expressive Robots: Implications for Children's Behavior toward Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25986v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing development of robots with artificial emotional expressiveness raises important questions about their persuasive potential in children's behavior. While research highlights the pragmatic value of emotional expressiveness in human social communication, the extent to which robotic expressiveness can or should influence empathic responses in children is grounds for debate. In a pilot study with 22 children (aged 7-11) we begin to explore the ways in which different levels of embodied expressiveness (body only, face only, body and face) of two basic emotions (happiness and sadness) displayed by an anthropomorphic robot (QTRobot) might modify children's behavior in a child-robot cooperative turn-taking game. We observed that children aligned their behavior to the robot's inferred emotional state. However, higher levels of expressiveness did not result in increased alignment. The preliminary results reported here provide a starting point for reflecting on robotic expressiveness and its role in shaping children's social-emotional behavior toward robots as social peers in the near future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulated Annealing for Multi-Robot Ergodic Information Acquisition Using Graph-Based Discretization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23214v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the goals of active information acquisition using multi-robot teams is to keep the relative uncertainty in each region at the same level to maintain identical acquisition quality (e.g., consistent target detection) in all the regions. To achieve this goal, ergodic coverage can be used to assign the number of samples according to the quality of observation, i.e., sampling noise levels. However, the noise levels are unknown to the robots. Although this noise can be estimated from samples, the estimates are unreliable at first and can generate fluctuating values. The main contribution of this paper is to use simulated annealing to generate the target sampling distribution, starting from uniform and gradually shifting to an estimated optimal distribution, by varying the coldness parameter of a Boltzmann distribution with the estimated sampling entropy as energy. Simulation results show a substantial improvement of both transient and asymptotic entropy compared to both uniform and direct-ergodic searches. Finally, a demonstration is performed with a TurtleBot swarm system to validate the physical applicability of the algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Intuitive Human-Robot Interaction through Embodied Gesture-Driven Control with Woven Tactile Skins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25951v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel human-robot interaction (HRI) framework that enables intuitive gesture-driven control through a capacitance-based woven tactile skin. Unlike conventional interfaces that rely on panels or handheld devices, the woven tactile skin integrates seamlessly with curved robot surfaces, enabling embodied interaction and narrowing the gap between human intent and robot response. Its woven design combines fabric-like flexibility with structural stability and dense multi-channel sensing through the interlaced conductive threads. Building on this capability, we define a gesture-action mapping of 14 single- and multi-touch gestures that cover representative robot commands, including task-space motion and auxiliary functions. A lightweight convolution-transformer model designed for gesture recognition in real time achieves an accuracy of near-100%, outperforming prior baseline approaches. Experiments on robot arm tasks, including pick-and-place and pouring, demonstrate that our system reduces task completion time by up to 57% compared with keyboard panels and teach pendants. Overall, our proposed framework demonstrates a practical pathway toward more natural and efficient embodied HRI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards autonomous photogrammetric forest inventory using a lightweight under-canopy robotic drone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12073v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drones are increasingly used in forestry to capture high-resolution remote sensing data, supporting enhanced monitoring, assessment, and decision-making processes. While operations above the forest canopy are already highly automated, flying inside forests remains challenging, primarily relying on manual piloting. In dense forests, relying on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for localization is not feasible. In addition, the drone must autonomously adjust its flight path to avoid collisions. Recently, advancements in robotics have enabled autonomous drone flights in GNSS-denied obstacle-rich areas. In this article, a step towards autonomous forest data collection is taken by building a prototype of a robotic under-canopy drone utilizing state-of-the-art open source methods and validating its performance for data collection inside forests. Specifically, the study focused on camera-based autonomous flight under the forest canopy and photogrammetric post-processing of the data collected with the low-cost onboard stereo camera. The autonomous flight capability of the prototype was evaluated through multiple test flights in boreal forests. The tree parameter estimation capability was studied by performing diameter at breast height (DBH) estimation. The prototype successfully carried out flights in selected challenging forest environments, and the experiments showed promising performance in forest 3D modeling with a miniaturized stereoscopic photogrammetric system. The DBH estimation achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.33 - 3.97 cm (10.69 - 12.98 %) across all trees. For trees with a DBH less than 30 cm, the RMSE was 1.16 - 2.56 cm (5.74 - 12.47 %). The results provide valuable insights into autonomous under-canopy forest mapping and highlight the critical next steps for advancing lightweight robotic drone systems for mapping complex forest environments.</p></details> | 35 pages, 11 Figures |
| **[Reinforced Embodied Planning with Verifiable Reward for Real-World Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25852v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the planner. We will open-source both the dataset and the trained model upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Time is slotted; each location can host at most one robot per slot; service consumes one slot; switching between locations incurs a one-slot travel delay; and arrivals are independent Bernoulli processes. We formulate a discounted-cost Markov decision process and propose Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL), a simple real-time policy that serves exhaustively when the current location is nonempty and, when idle, switches to a longest unoccupied nonempty location, and we prove the optimality of this policy. As baselines, we tune a fixed-dwell cyclic policy via a discrete-time delay expression and implement a first-come-first-serve policy. Across server-to-location ratios and loads, ESL consistently yields lower discounted holding cost and smaller mean queue lengths, with action-time fractions showing more serving and restrained switching. Its simplicity and robustness make ESL a practical default for real-time multi-robot scheduling systems.</p></details> |  |

Over the years, powerful tools like the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) have been developed, offering numerous motion planning algorithms. However, existing frameworks often struggle to deliver the level of predictability and repeatability demanded by high-stakes applications -- ranging from ensuring safety in industrial environments to the creation of high-quality motion datasets for robot learning. Complementing existing tools, we introduce SRMP (Search-based Robot Motion Planning), a new software framework tailored for robotic manipulation. SRMP distinguishes itself by generating consistent and reliable trajectories, and is the first software tool to offer motion planning algorithms for multi-robot manipulation tasks. SRMP easily integrates with major simulators, including MuJoCo, Sapien, Genesis, and PyBullet via a Python and C++ API. SRMP includes a dedicated MoveIt! plugin that enables immediate deployment on robot hardware and seamless integration with existing pipelines. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate in this paper that SRMP not only meets the rigorous demands of industrial and safety-critical applications but also sets a new standard for consistency in motion planning across diverse robotic systems.

However, for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks such as robotic soccer, this end-to-end approach often fails due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in developing embodied world models is not merely increasing the fidelity or size of environments, but scaling their structural complexity through explicit hierarchical scaffolding. We posit that an effective world model for decision-making must model not only the world's physics but also its task semantics. Drawing from a systematic review of 2024 research in low-resource multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Bayesian Strategy Networks (BSNs), with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These methods decompose complex goals into manageable subgoals, creating an intrinsic curriculum that shapes agent learning. We propose that such structured environments are essential for bridging the gap between simple, reactive behaviors and sophisticated, strategic team play. We further extend this principle, proposing that this scaffolding can be generalized to other complex domains and dynamically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which act as generative world models of tasks. By building environments with explicit, composable task layers, we can guide agent exploration more efficiently, generate meaningful learning signals, and ultimately train more capable and general-purpose agents with fewer resources than purely end-to-end approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Embodied World Models for Decision Making (EWM)</p></details> |

We propose a robot-centric square spiral layout with a central tramline, enabling simpler motion and more efficient coverage. To exploit this geometry, we develop a navigation stack combining DH-ResNet18 waypoint regression, pixel-to-odometry mapping, A* planning, and model predictive control (MPC). In simulations, the spiral layout yields up to 28% shorter paths and about 25% faster execution for waypoint-based tasks across 500 waypoints than linear layouts, while full-field coverage performance is comparable to an optimised linear U-turn strategy. Multi-robot studies demonstrate efficient coordination on the spirals rule-constrained graph, with a greedy allocator achieving 33-37% lower batch completion times than a Hungarian assignment under our setup. These results highlight the potential of redesigning field geometry to better suit autonomous agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> |

While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships. Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs, an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.</p></details> |  |

Although object-centric policies improve sample efficiency, it does not resolve this limitation. In this work, we propose Multi-Stream Generative Policy (MSG), an inference-time composition framework that trains multiple object-centric policies and combines them at inference to improve generalization and sample efficiency. MSG is model-agnostic and inference-only, hence widely applicable to various generative policies and training paradigms. We perform extensive experiments both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that our approach learns high-quality generative policies from as few as five demonstrations, resulting in a 95% reduction in demonstrations, and improves policy performance by 89 percent compared to single-stream approaches. Furthermore, we present comprehensive ablation studies on various composition strategies and provide practical recommendations for deployment. Finally, MSG enables zero-shot object instance transfer. We make our code publicly available at https://msg.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

In documentary filmmaking, they offer dynamic, otherwise unreachable perspectives, transforming how stories are told. Wildlife documentaries especially benefit, yet drones also raise ethical concerns: the risk of disturbing the animals they aim to capture. This paper introduces CineWild, an autonomous UAV framework that combines robotics, cinematography, and ethics. Built on model predictive control, CineWild dynamically adjusts flight paths and camera settings to balance cinematic quality with animal welfare. Key features include adaptive zoom for filming from acoustic and visual safe distances, path-planning that avoids an animal's field of view, and smooth, low-noise maneuvers. CineWild exemplifies interdisciplinary innovation-bridging engineering, visual storytelling, and environmental ethics. We validate the system through simulation studies and will release the code upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Recent works leverage pre-trained vision-language models to measure the similarity between encoded visual observations and textual instructions, and then train a model to map this similarity to robot actions. However, this two-step approach limits the model to capture the relationship between visual observations and textual instructions, leading to reduced precision in manipulation tasks. We propose to learn visual-textual associations through a self-supervised pretext task: reconstructing a masked goal image conditioned on an input image and textual instructions. This formulation allows the model to learn visual-action representations without robot action supervision. The learned representations can then be fine-tuned for manipulation tasks with only a few demonstrations. We also introduce the \textit{Omni-Object Pick-and-Place} dataset, which consists of annotated robot tabletop manipulation episodes, including 180 object classes and 3,200 instances with corresponding textual instructions. This dataset enables the model to acquire diverse object priors and allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of its generalisation capability across object instances. Experimental results on the five benchmarks, including both simulated and real-robot validations, demonstrate that our method outperforms prior art.</p></details> |  |

Conventional robotic systems however often focus on obstacle avoidance, neglecting social cues necessary for seamless human-robot interaction. To address this gap, we propose a framework to recognize human group interactions for socially aware navigation. Our method utilizes color and depth frames from a monocular RGB-D camera to estimate 3D human keypoints and positions. Principal component analysis (PCA) is then used to determine dominant interaction directions. The shoelace formula is finally applied to compute interest points and engagement areas. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the validity of the proposed method. The results show that our method is capable of recognizing group interactions across different scenarios with varying numbers of individuals. It also achieves high-speed performance, processing each frame in approximately 4 ms on a single-board computer used in robotic systems. The method is implemented as a ROS 2 package making it simple to integrate into existing navigation systems.

Teleoperated robotic echocardiography has been proposed as a solution; however, clinical studies report longer examination times than manual procedures, increasing diagnostic delays and operator workload. Automating non-expert tasks, such as automatically moving the probe to an ideal starting pose, offers a pathway to reduce this burden. Prior vision- and depth-based approaches to estimate an initial probe pose are sensitive to lighting, texture, and anatomical variability. We propose a robot-mounted 2D LiDAR-based approach that reconstructs the chest surface in 3D and estimates the initial probe pose automatically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of robot-mounted 2D LiDAR used for 3D reconstruction of a human body surface. Through plane-based extrinsic calibration, the transformation between the LiDAR and robot base frames was estimated with an overall root mean square (RMS) residual of 1.8 mm and rotational uncertainty below 0.2{\deg}. The chest front surface, reconstructed from two linear LiDAR sweeps, was aligned with non-rigid templates to identify an initial probe pose. A mannequin-based study assessing reconstruction accuracy showed mean surface errors of 2.78 +/- 0.21 mm. Human trials (N=5) evaluating the proposed approach found probe initial points typically 20-30 mm from the clinically defined initial point, while the variation across repeated trials on the same subject was less than 4 mm.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Fidelity-Aware Data Composition for Robust Robot Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24797v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale, visually homogeneous datasets can be susceptible to shortcut learning, which impairs their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While generative data augmentation is a common approach to introduce diversity, it presents a subtle challenge: data composition. Naively mixing real and synthetic data can corrupt the learning signal, as this process often prioritizes visual diversity at the expense of information fidelity. This paper suggests that robust generalization depends on principled, fidelity-aware data composition. We introduce Coherent Information Fidelity Tuning (CIFT), a framework that treats data composition as an optimization problem. CIFT uses a practical proxy for Information Fidelity based on the feature-space geometry of a dataset. This enables the identification of a phase transition, termed the Decoherence Point, where training stability degrades. The framework includes a generative engine, Multi-View Video Augmentation (MVAug), to synthesize a causally disentangled data spectrum for this tuning process. Applying CIFT to policy architectures such as $\pi_0$ and Diffusion Policy improves OOD success rates by over 54\%. These results indicate that fidelity-aware composition, beyond data synthesis alone, is an important component for developing robust, general-purpose robots.</p></details> | 33 pages |

Single-sensor systems face inherent limitations: LiDAR provides omnidirectional coverage but lacks rich texture information, while cameras capture high-resolution detail but suffer from restricted field of view. We introduce APREBot (Active Perception System for Reflexive Evasion Robot), a novel framework that integrates reflexive evasion with active hierarchical perception. APREBot strategically combines LiDAR-based omnidirectional scanning with camera-based active focusing, achieving comprehensive environmental awareness essential for agile obstacle avoidance in quadruped robots. We validate APREBot through extensive sim-to-real experiments on a quadruped platform, evaluating diverse obstacle types, trajectories, and approach directions. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in both safety metrics and operational efficiency, highlighting APREBot's potential for dependable autonomy in safety-critical scenarios.

However, many existing approaches neglect the humans post-handover action, relying on assumptions that limit generalizability. To address this gap, we propose LLM-Handover, a novel framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-based reasoning with part segmentation to enable context-aware grasp selection and execution. Given an RGB-D image and a task description, our system infers relevant object parts and selects grasps that optimize post-handover usability. To support evaluation, we introduce a new dataset of 60 household objects spanning 12 categories, each annotated with detailed part labels. We first demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of the used state-of-the-art part segmentation method, in the context of robot-human handovers. Next, we show that LLM-Handover achieves higher grasp success rates and adapts better to post-handover task constraints. During hardware experiments, we achieve a success rate of 83% in a zero-shot setting over conventional and unconventional post-handover tasks. Finally, our user study underlines that our method enables more intuitive, context-aware handovers, with participants preferring it in 86% of cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Stabilizing Humanoid Robot Trajectory Generation via Physics-Informed Learning and Control-Informed Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24697v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent trends in humanoid robot control have successfully employed imitation learning to enable the learned generation of smooth, human-like trajectories from human data. While these approaches make more realistic motions possible, they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability. We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Hangzhou, China, 2025</p></details> |
| **[PoseDiff: A Unified Diffusion Model Bridging Robot Pose Estimation and Video-to-Action Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24591v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI.

| **[U-DiT Policy: U-shaped Diffusion Transformers for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24579v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based methods have been acknowledged as a powerful paradigm for end-to-end visuomotor control in robotics. Most existing approaches adopt a Diffusion Policy in U-Net architecture (DP-U), which, while effective, suffers from limited global context modeling and over-smoothing artifacts. To address these issues, we propose U-DiT Policy, a novel U-shaped Diffusion Transformer framework. U-DiT preserves the multi-scale feature fusion advantages of U-Net while integrating the global context modeling capability of Transformers, thereby enhancing representational power and policy expressiveness. We evaluate U-DiT extensively across both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. In simulation, U-DiT achieves an average performance gain of 10\% over baseline methods and surpasses Transformer-based diffusion policies (DP-T) that use AdaLN blocks by 6\% under comparable parameter budgets. On real-world robotic tasks, U-DiT demonstrates superior generalization and robustness, achieving an average improvement of 22.5\% over DP-U. In addition, robustness and generalization experiments under distractor and lighting variations further highlight the advantages of U-DiT. These results highlight the effectiveness and practical potential of U-DiT Policy as a new foundation for diffusion-based robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting Robot Teams with Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24575v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a framework towards prompting multi-robot teams with high-level tasks using natural language expressions. Our objective is to use the reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in understanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these for multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an individual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and must continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework that possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and semantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time operation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and sequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an RNN, and align its internal states with the semantics of a given task. By training a graph neural network (GNN) control policy that is conditioned on the hidden states of the RNN and the language embeddings, our method enables robots to execute task-relevant actions in a decentralized manner. We present evaluations of this single light-weight interpretable model on various simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks that require sequential and collaborative behavior by the team -- sites.google.com/view/prompting-teams.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCOPE: Semantic Conditioning for Sim2Real Category-Level Object Pose Estimation in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24572v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of 31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to 100\%.

| **[Loosely coupled 4D-Radar-Inertial Odometry for Ground Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17289v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate robot odometry is essential for autonomous navigation. While numerous techniques have been developed based on various sensor suites, odometry estimation using only radar and IMU remains an underexplored area. Radar proves particularly valuable in environments where traditional sensors, like cameras or LiDAR, may struggle, especially in low-light conditions or when faced with environmental challenges like fog, rain or smoke. However, despite its robustness, radar data is noisier and more prone to outliers, requiring specialized processing approaches. In this paper, we propose a graph-based optimization approach using a sliding window for radar-based odometry, designed to maintain robust relationships between poses by forming a network of connections, while keeping computational costs fixed (specially beneficial in long trajectories). Additionally, we introduce an enhancement in the ego-velocity estimation specifically for ground vehicles, both holonomic and non-holonomic, which subsequently improves the direct odometry input required by the optimizer. Finally, we present a comparative study of our approach against existing algorithms, showing how our pure odometry approach inproves the state of art in most trajectories of the NTU4DRadLM dataset, achieving promising results when evaluating key performance metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, 33 references</p></details> |

Particularly, we introduce the Public Good Game (PGG), a model highlighting the tension between individual self-interest and collective well-being. In this work, we present a modified version of the PGG, where three human participants engage in the game with the humanoid robot iCub to assess whether various robot game strategies (e.g., always cooperate, always free ride, and tit-for-tat) can influence the participants' inclination to cooperate. We test our setup during a pilot study with nineteen participants. A preliminary analysis indicates that participants prefer not to invest their money in the common pool, despite they perceive the robot as generous. By conducting this research, we seek to gain valuable insights into the role that robots can play in promoting trust and cohesion during human-robot interactions within group contexts. The results of this study may hold considerable potential for developing social robots capable of fostering trust and cooperation within mixed human-robot groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work presented at the workshop BAILAR in conjunction with IEEE RO-MAN 2023.

| **[Towards agile multi-robot systems in the real world: Fast onboard tracking of active blinking markers for relative localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01172v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel onboard tracking approach enabling vision-based relative localization and communication using Active blinking Marker Tracking (AMT) is introduced in this article. Active blinking markers on multi-robot team members improve the robustness of relative localization for aerial vehicles in tightly coupled multi-robot systems during real-world deployments, while also serving as a resilient communication system. Traditional tracking algorithms struggle with fast-moving blinking markers due to their intermittent appearance in camera frames and the complexity of associating multiple of these markers across consecutive frames. AMT addresses this by using weighted polynomial regression to predict the future appearance of active blinking markers while accounting for uncertainty in the prediction. In outdoor experiments, the AMT approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods in tracking density, accuracy, and complexity. The experimental validation of this novel tracking approach for relative localization and optical communication involved testing motion patterns motivated by our research on agile multi-robot deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided Reinforcement Learning for Omnidirectional 3D Jumping in Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16481v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jumping poses a significant challenge for quadruped robots, despite being crucial for many operational scenarios. While optimisation methods exist for controlling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive knowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in real-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable alternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of sample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and predictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the safety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages physical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining B\'ezier curves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynaMIC: Dynamic Multimodal In-Context Learning Enabled Embodied Robot Counterfactual Resistance Ability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24413v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large pre-trained models based on natural language has breathed new life into robotics development. Extensive research has integrated large models with robots, utilizing the powerful semantic understanding and generation capabilities of large models to facilitate robot control through natural language instructions gradually. However, we found that robots that strictly adhere to human instructions, especially those containing misleading information, may encounter errors during task execution, potentially leading to safety hazards. This resembles the concept of counterfactuals in natural language processing (NLP), which has not yet attracted much attention in robotic research. In an effort to highlight this issue for future studies, this paper introduced directive counterfactuals (DCFs) arising from misleading human directives. We present DynaMIC, a framework for generating robot task flows to identify DCFs and relay feedback to humans proactively. This capability can help robots be sensitive to potential DCFs within a task, thus enhancing the reliability of the execution process. We conducted semantic-level experiments and ablation studies, showcasing the effectiveness of this framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[MimicDreamer: Aligning Human and Robot Demonstrations for Scalable VLA Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22199v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Action (VLA) models derive their generalization capability from diverse training data, yet collecting embodied robot interaction data remains prohibitively expensive. In contrast, human demonstration videos are far more scalable and cost-efficient to collect, and recent studies confirm their effectiveness in training VLA models. However, a significant domain gap persists between human videos and robot-executed videos, including unstable camera viewpoints, visual discrepancies between human hands and robotic arms, and differences in motion dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose MimicDreamer, a framework that turns fast, low-cost human demonstrations into robot-usable supervision by jointly aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to directly support policy training. For visual alignment, we propose H2R Aligner, a video diffusion model that generates high-fidelity robot demonstration videos by transferring motion from human manipulation footage. For viewpoint stabilization, EgoStabilizer is proposed, which canonicalizes egocentric videos via homography and inpaints occlusions and distortions caused by warping. For action alignment, we map human hand trajectories to the robot frame and apply a constrained inverse kinematics solver to produce feasible, low-jitter joint commands with accurate pose tracking. Empirically, VLA models trained purely on our synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real robots. Moreover, scaling training with human data significantly boosts performance compared to models trained solely on real robot data; our approach improves the average success rate by 14.7\% across six representative manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViReSkill: Vision-Grounded Replanning with Skill Memory for LLM-Based Planning in Lifelong Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24219v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Imitation Learning (IL) often adapt slowly to new tasks, whereas recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promise knowledge-rich planning from minimal data. Deploying LLMs/VLMs for motion planning, however, faces two key obstacles: (i) symbolic plans are rarely grounded in scene geometry and object physics, and (ii) model outputs can vary for identical prompts, undermining execution reliability. We propose ViReSkill, a framework that pairs vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory for accumulation and reuse. When a failure occurs, the replanner generates a new action sequence conditioned on the current scene, tailored to the observed state. On success, the executed plan is stored as a reusable skill and replayed in future encounters without additional calls to LLMs/VLMs. This feedback loop enables autonomous continual learning: each attempt immediately expands the skill set and stabilizes subsequent executions. We evaluate ViReSkill on simulators such as LIBERO and RLBench as well as on a physical robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate, demonstrating robust sim-to-real generalization.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches face a dilemma: imitation policy learning demands extensive demonstrations to cover task variations, while modular methods often lack flexibility in dynamic scenes. We introduce VLBiMan, a framework that derives reusable skills from a single human example through task-aware decomposition, preserving invariant primitives as anchors while dynamically adapting adjustable components via vision-language grounding. This adaptation mechanism resolves scene ambiguities caused by background changes, object repositioning, or visual clutter without policy retraining, leveraging semantic parsing and geometric feasibility constraints. Moreover, the system inherits human-like hybrid control capabilities, enabling mixed synchronous and asynchronous use of both arms. Extensive experiments validate VLBiMan across tool-use and multi-object tasks, demonstrating: (1) a drastic reduction in demonstration requirements compared to imitation baselines, (2) compositional generalization through atomic skill splicing for long-horizon tasks, (3) robustness to novel but semantically similar objects and external disturbances, and (4) strong cross-embodiment transfer, showing that skills learned from human demonstrations can be instantiated on different robotic platforms without retraining. By bridging human priors with vision-language anchored adaptation, our work takes a step toward practical and versatile dual-arm manipulation in unstructured settings.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Blast Hole Seeking and Dipping -- The Navigation and Perception Framework in a Mine Site Inspection Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13785v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site and detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to be inspected internally to assess subsurface material types and drill quality, in order to significantly reduce downstream material handling costs. Manual hole inspection is slow and expensive, limited in its ability to capture the geometric and geological characteristics of holes. This has been the motivation for the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - "DIPPeR". In this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a robust perception and navigation framework that provides streamlined blasthole seeking, tracking and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. To address challenges in the surface mining environment, where GPS and odometry data are noisy without RTK correction, we adopt a proximity-based adaptive navigation approach, enabling the vehicle to dynamically adjust its operations based on detected target availability and localisation accuracy. For perception, we process LiDAR data to extract the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above ground, then project the 3D cone points into a virtual depth image to form accurate 2D segmentation of hole regions. To ensure continuous target-tracking as the robot approaches the goal, our system automatically adjusts projection parameters to preserve consistent hole image appearance. At the vicinity of the hole, we apply least squares circle fitting with non-maximum candidate suppression to achieve accurate hole detection and collision-free down-hole sensor placement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field trials.

| **[Preference-Based Long-Horizon Robotic Stacking with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24163v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained large language models (LLMs) can work as high-level robotic planners by reasoning over abstract task descriptions and natural language instructions, etc. However, they have shown a lack of knowledge and effectiveness in planning long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks where the physical properties of the objects are essential. An example is the stacking of containers with hidden objects inside, which involves reasoning over hidden physics properties such as weight and stability. To this end, this paper proposes to use multimodal LLMs as high-level planners for such long-horizon robotic stacking tasks. The LLM takes multimodal inputs for each object to stack and infers the current best stacking sequence by reasoning over stacking preferences. Furthermore, in order to enable the LLM to reason over multiple preferences at the same time without giving explicit instructions, we propose to create a custom dataset considering stacking preferences including weight, stability, size, and footprint, to fine-tune the LLM. Compared to the pretrained LLM with prompt tuning, we demonstrate the improved stacking completion of the LLM fine-tuned with our custom dataset via large-scale simulation evaluation. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework for the long-horizon stacking task on a real humanoid robot in an online manner.</p></details> |  |
