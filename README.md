| **[Can AI Perceive Physical Danger and Intervene?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21651v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent -- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions. The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark is released at https://asimov-benchmark.github.io/v2</p></details> |  |
| **[PersonaAgent with GraphRAG: Community-Aware Knowledge Graphs for Personalized LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17467v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for persona-based language model system, motivated by the need for personalized AI agents that adapt to individual user preferences. In our approach, the agent embodies the user's "persona" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge. On the LaMP benchmark, our method improves news categorization F1 by 11.1%, movie tagging F1 by 56.1%, and reduces product rating MAE by 10.4% over prior methods. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PersonaAgentwGraphRAG-DE6F</p></details> |  |
| **[TP-MDDN: Task-Preferenced Multi-Demand-Driven Navigation with Autonomous Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17225v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In daily life, people often move through spaces to find objects that meet their needs, posing a key challenge in embodied AI. Traditional Demand-Driven Navigation (DDN) handles one need at a time but does not reflect the complexity of real-world tasks involving multiple needs and personal choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task-Preferenced Multi-Demand-Driven Navigation (TP-MDDN), a new benchmark for long-horizon navigation involving multiple sub-demands with explicit task preferences. To solve TP-MDDN, we propose AWMSystem, an autonomous decision-making system composed of three key modules: BreakLLM (instruction decomposition), LocateLLM (goal selection), and StatusMLLM (task monitoring). For spatial memory, we design MASMap, which combines 3D point cloud accumulation with 2D semantic mapping for accurate and efficient environmental understanding. Our Dual-Tempo action generation framework integrates zero-shot planning with policy-based fine control, and is further supported by an Adaptive Error Corrector that handles failure cases in real time. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both perception accuracy and navigation robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Toward Sustainable Generative AI: A Scoping Review of Carbon Footprint and Environmental Impacts Across Training and Inference Stages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17179v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI is spreading rapidly, creating significant social and economic value while also raising concerns about its high energy use and environmental sustainability. While prior studies have predominantly focused on the energy-intensive nature of the training phase, the cumulative environmental footprint generated during large-scale service operations, particularly in the inference phase, has received comparatively less attention. To bridge this gap this study conducts a scoping review of methodologies and research trends in AI carbon footprint assessment. We analyze the classification and standardization status of existing AI carbon measurement tools and methodologies, and comparatively examine the environmental impacts arising from both training and inference stages. In addition, we identify how multidimensional factors such as model size, prompt complexity, serving environments, and system boundary definitions shape the resulting carbon footprint. Our review reveals critical limitations in current AI carbon accounting practices, including methodological inconsistencies, technology-specific biases, and insufficient attention to end-to-end system perspectives. Building on these insights, we propose future research and governance directions: (1) establishing standardized and transparent universal measurement protocols, (2) designing dynamic evaluation frameworks that incorporate user behavior, (3) developing life-cycle monitoring systems that encompass embodied emissions, and (4) advancing multidimensional sustainability assessment framework that balance model performance with environmental efficiency. This paper provides a foundation for interdisciplinary dialogue aimed at building a sustainable AI ecosystem and offers a baseline guideline for researchers seeking to understand the environmental implications of AI across technical, social, and operational dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 5 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[VLA-Pruner: Temporal-Aware Dual-Level Visual Token Pruning for Efficient Vision-Language-Action Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16449v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergence of psychopathological computations in large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08016v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can large language models (LLMs) instantiate computations of psychopathology? An effective approach to the question hinges on addressing two factors. First, for conceptual validity, we require a general and computational account of psychopathology that is applicable to computational entities without biological embodiment or subjective experience. Second, psychopathological computations, derived from the adapted theory, need to be empirically identified within the LLM's internal processing. Thus, we establish a computational-theoretical framework to provide an account of psychopathology applicable to LLMs. Based on the framework, we conduct experiments demonstrating two key claims: first, that the computational structure of psychopathology exists in LLMs; and second, that executing this computational structure results in psychopathological functions. We further observe that as LLM size increases, the computational structure of psychopathology becomes denser and that the functions become more effective. Taken together, the empirical results corroborate our hypothesis that network-theoretic computations of psychopathology have already emerged in LLMs. This suggests that certain LLM behaviors mirroring psychopathology may not be a superficial mimicry but a feature of their internal processing. Our work shows the promise of developing a new powerful in silico model of psychopathology and also alludes to the possibility of safety threat from the AI systems with psychopathological behaviors in the near future.</p></details> | pre-print |
| **[InternData-A1: Pioneering High-Fidelity Synthetic Data for Pre-training Generalist Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16651v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works explore how real and synthetic data contribute to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models' generalization. While current VLA models have shown the strong effectiveness of large-scale real-robot pre-training, synthetic data has not previously demonstrated comparable capability at scale. This paper provides the first evidence that synthetic data alone can match the performance of the strongest $π$-dataset in pre-training a VLA model, revealing the substantial value of large-scale simulation. The resulting model also exhibits surprisingly zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on several challenging tasks. Our synthetic dataset, InternData-A1, contains over 630k trajectories and 7,433 hours across 4 embodiments, 18 skills, 70 tasks, and 227 scenes, covering rigid, articulated, deformable, and fluid-object manipulation. It is generated through a highly autonomous, fully decoupled, and compositional simulation pipeline that enables long-horizon skill composition, flexible task assembly, and heterogeneous embodiments with minimal manual tuning. Using the same architecture as $π_0$, we pre-train a model entirely on InternData-A1 and find that it matches the official $π_0$ across 49 simulation tasks, 5 real-world tasks, and 4 long-horizon dexterous tasks. We release the dataset and will open-source the generation pipeline to broaden access to large-scale robotic data and to lower the barrier to scalable data creation for embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

MiMo-Embodied sets new records across 17 embodied AI benchmarks in Task Planning, Affordance Prediction and Spatial Understanding, while also excelling in 12 autonomous driving benchmarks across Environmental Perception, Status Prediction, and Driving Planning. Across these tasks, MiMo-Embodied significantly outperforms existing open-source, closed-source, and specialized baselines. Our results indicate that through multi-stage learning, curated data construction, and CoT/RL fine-tuning, these two domains exhibit strong positive transfer and mutually reinforce one another. We provide a detailed analysis of our model design and training methodologies to facilitate further research.

| **[TC-Light: Temporally Coherent Generative Rendering for Realistic World Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18904v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Illumination and texture editing are critical dimensions for world-to-world transfer, which is valuable for applications including sim2real and real2real visual data scaling up for embodied AI. Existing techniques generatively re-render the input video to realize the transfer, such as video relighting models and conditioned world generation models. Nevertheless, these models are predominantly limited to the domain of training data (e.g., portrait) or fall into the bottleneck of temporal consistency and computation efficiency, especially when the input video involves complex dynamics and long durations. In this paper, we propose TC-Light, a novel generative renderer to overcome these problems. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark. Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible re-rendering results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost. The code and video demos are available at https://dekuliutesla.github.io/tclight/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dekuliutesla.github.io/tclight/ Code: https://github.com/Linketic/TC-Light</p></details> |
| **[The Shawshank Redemption of Embodied AI: Understanding and Benchmarking Indirect Environmental Jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16347v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in embodied AI agents, while being effective, brings safety concerns such as jailbreaking. Prior work have explored the possibility of directly jailbreaking the embodied agents through elaborated multi-modal prompts. However, no prior work has studied or even reported indirect jailbreaks in embodied AI, where a black-box attacker induces a jailbreak without issuing direct prompts to the embodied agent. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, indirect environmental jailbreak (IEJ), a novel attack to jailbreak embodied AI via indirect prompt injected into the environment, such as malicious instructions written on a wall. Our key insight is that embodied AI does not ''think twice'' about the instructions provided by the environment -- a blind trust that attackers can exploit to jailbreak the embodied agent. We further design and implement open-source prototypes of two fully-automated frameworks: SHAWSHANK, the first automatic attack generation framework for the proposed attack IEJ; and SHAWSHANK-FORGE, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for IEJ. Then, using SHAWSHANK-FORGE, we automatically construct SHAWSHANK-BENCH, the first benchmark for indirectly jailbreaking embodied agents. Together, our two frameworks and one benchmark answer the questions of what content can be used for malicious IEJ instructions, where they should be placed, and how IEJ can be systematically evaluated. Evaluation results show that SHAWSHANK outperforms eleven existing methods across 3,957 task-scene combinations and compromises all six tested VLMs. Furthermore, current defenses only partially mitigate our attack, and we have responsibly disclosed our findings to all affected VLM vendors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models with Daily Composite Tasks in Home Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17425v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key feature differentiating artificial general intelligence (AGI) from traditional AI is that AGI can perform composite tasks that require a wide range of capabilities. Although embodied agents powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer rich perceptual and interactive capabilities, it remains largely unexplored whether they can solve composite tasks. In the current work, we designed a set of composite tasks inspired by common daily activities observed in early childhood development. Within a dynamic and simulated home environment, these tasks span three core domains: object understanding, spatial intelligence, and social activity. We evaluated 17 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs on these tasks. The results consistently showed poor performance across all three domains, indicating a substantial gap between current capabilities and general intelligence requirements. Together, our tasks offer a preliminary framework for evaluating the general capabilities of embodied agents, marking an early but significant step toward the development of embodied MLLMs and their real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sensorium Arc: AI Agent System for Oceanic Data Exploration and Interactive Eco-Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15997v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensorium Arc (AI reflects on climate) is a real-time multimodal interactive AI agent system that personifies the ocean as a poetic speaker and guides users through immersive explorations of complex marine data. Built on a modular multi-agent system and retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework, Sensorium enables natural spoken conversations with AI agents that embodies the ocean's perspective, generating responses that blend scientific insight with ecological poetics. Through keyword detection and semantic parsing, the system dynamically triggers data visualizations and audiovisual playback based on time, location, and thematic cues drawn from the dialogue. Developed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of the Force Majeure and inspired by the eco-aesthetic philosophy of Newton Harrison, Sensorium Arc reimagines ocean data not as an abstract dataset but as a living narrative. The project demonstrates the potential of conversational AI agents to mediate affective, intuitive access to high-dimensional environmental data and proposes a new paradigm for human-machine-ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>(to a...</summary><p>(to appear) NeurIPS 2025 Creative AI Track</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Shot Open-Vocabulary Human Motion Grounding with Test-Time Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15379v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding complex human activities demands the ability to decompose motion into fine-grained, semantic-aligned sub-actions. This motion grounding process is crucial for behavior analysis, embodied AI and virtual reality. Yet, most existing methods rely on dense supervision with predefined action classes, which are infeasible in open-vocabulary, real-world settings. In this paper, we propose ZOMG, a zero-shot, open-vocabulary framework that segments motion sequences into semantically meaningful sub-actions without requiring any annotations or fine-tuning. Technically, ZOMG integrates (1) language semantic partition, which leverages large language models to decompose instructions into ordered sub-action units, and (2) soft masking optimization, which learns instance-specific temporal masks to focus on frames critical to sub-actions, while maintaining intra-segment continuity and enforcing inter-segment separation, all without altering the pretrained encoder. Experiments on three motion-language datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art effectiveness and efficiency of motion grounding performance, outperforming prior methods by +8.7\% mAP on HumanML3D benchmark. Meanwhile, significant improvements also exist in downstream retrieval, establishing a new paradigm for annotation-free motion understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Look, Zoom, Understand: The Robotic Eyeball for Embodied Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15279v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embodied AI perception systems, visual perception should be active: the goal is not to passively process static images, but to actively acquire more informative data within pixel and spatial budget constraints. Existing vision models and fixed RGB-D camera systems fundamentally fail to reconcile wide-area coverage with fine-grained detail acquisition, severely limiting their efficacy in open-world robotic applications. To address this issue, we propose EyeVLA, a robotic eyeball for active visual perception that can take proactive actions based on instructions, enabling clear observation of fine-grained target objects and detailed information across a wide spatial extent. EyeVLA discretizes action behaviors into action tokens and integrates them with vision-language models (VLMs) that possess strong open-world understanding capabilities, enabling joint modeling of vision, language, and actions within a single autoregressive sequence. By using the 2D bounding box coordinates to guide the reasoning chain and applying reinforcement learning to refine the viewpoint selection policy, we transfer the open-world scene understanding capability of the VLM to a vision language action (VLA) policy using only minimal real-world data. Experiments show that our system efficiently performs instructed scenes in real-world environments and actively acquires more accurate visual information through instruction-driven actions of rotation and zoom, thereby achieving strong environmental perception capabilities. EyeVLA introduces a novel robotic vision system that leverages detailed and spatially rich, large-scale embodied data, and actively acquires highly informative visual observations for downstream embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboTidy : A 3D Gaussian Splatting Household Tidying Benchmark for Embodied Navigation and Action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14161v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Household tidying is an important application area, yet current benchmarks neither model user preferences nor support mobility, and they generalize poorly, making it hard to comprehensively assess integrated language-to-action capabilities. To address this, we propose RoboTidy, a unified benchmark for language-guided household tidying that supports Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and Vision-Language-Navigation (VLN) training and evaluation. RoboTidy provides 500 photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) household scenes (covering 500 objects and containers) with collisions, formulates tidying as an "Action (Object, Container)" list, and supplies 6.4k high-quality manipulation demonstration trajectories and 1.5k naviagtion trajectories to support both few-shot and large-scale training. We also deploy RoboTidy in the real world for object tidying, establishing an end-to-end benchmark for household tidying. RoboTidy offers a scalable platform and bridges a key gap in embodied AI by enabling holistic and realistic evaluation of language-guided robots.</p></details> |  |

The applications running on these edge devices impose differentiated Service Level Objectives (SLO) requirements on LLM services, specifically manifested as distinct constraints on Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT) as well as end-to-end latency. Notably, edge devices typically handle real-time tasks that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as machine control and navigation planning. However, existing scheduling service systems still prioritize maximizing output token throughput as the sole optimization objective, failing to adequately address the diversity of SLO requirements. This ultimately results in persistently high violation rates for end-to-end latency or TPOT related SLOs. This paper proposes SLICE, an innovative scheduling solution designed for edge computing scenarios with differentiated SLO requirements. By combining a utility-maximizing request scheduling algorithm with a dynamic iterative control mechanism for generation rates, SLICE significantly improves LLM inference service SLO attainment. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art solutions Orca and FastServe, SLICE achieves up to 35x higher SLO attainment and 3.4x advantage in task completion time than the other two solutions.

| **[Continuous Vision-Language-Action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment for Behavioral Cloning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14396v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026, the Project website is available at https://qhemu.github.io/CCoL/</p></details> |

Additionally, 3D scene generation is vital for advancing embodied AI and world models, which depend on diverse, high-quality scenes for learning and evaluation. In this work, we propose Gen3d, a novel method for generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes from a single image. After the initial point cloud is created by lifting the RGBD image, Gen3d maintains and expands its world model. The 3D scene is finalized through optimizing a Gaussian splatting representation. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of our method in generating a world model and Synthesizing high-fidelity and consistent novel views.</p></details> | 5 pages , 2 figures |

The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has allowed rapid progress in robotic manipulation. This survey summarizes the evolution of robotic manipulation from mechanical programming to embodied intelligence, alongside the transition from simple grippers to multi-fingered dexterous hands, outlining key characteristics and main challenges. Focusing on the current stage of embodied dexterous manipulation, we highlight recent advances in two critical areas: dexterous manipulation data collection (via simulation, human demonstrations, and teleoperation) and skill-learning frameworks (imitation and reinforcement learning). Then, based on the overview of the existing data collection paradigm and learning framework, three key challenges restricting the development of dexterous robotic manipulation are summarized and discussed.</p></details> |  |

Existing systems mitigate this through compute-communication overlap but often fail to meet theoretical peak performance across heterogeneous workloads and new accelerators. Instead of operator-specific techniques, we ask whether a small set of simple, reusable principles can systematically guide the design of optimal multi-GPU kernels. We present ParallelKittens (PK), a minimal CUDA framework that drastically simplifies the development of overlapped multi-GPU kernels. PK extends the ThunderKittens framework and embodies the principles of multi-GPU kernel design through eight core primitives and a unified programming template, derived from a comprehensive analysis of the factors that govern multi-GPU performance$\unicode{x2014}$data-transfer mechanisms, resource scheduling, and design overheads. We validate PK on both Hopper and Blackwell architectures. With fewer than 50 lines of device code, PK achieves up to $2.33 \times$ speedup for data- and tensor-parallel workloads, $4.08 \times$ for sequence-parallel workloads, and $1.22 \times$ for expert-parallel workloads.</p></details> |  |

Interactable digital twins of such objects have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. Unfortunately, current methods to digitize articulated real-world objects require carefully captured data, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable acquisition. We focus on motion analysis and part-level segmentation of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to obtain at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is challenging due to simultaneous object and camera motion and significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iTACO: a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories that is 20$\times$ larger than available in prior work. We then compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Our experiments show that iTACO outperforms existing articulated object digital twin methods on both synthetic and real casually captured RGBD videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>3DV 2...</summary><p>3DV 2026 camera-ready version.

However, most existing 3D generation methods overlook key physical and articulation properties, thereby limiting their utility in embodied AI. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhysX-Anything, the first simulation-ready physical 3D generative framework that, given a single in-the-wild image, produces high-quality sim-ready 3D assets with explicit geometry, articulation, and physical attributes. Specifically, we propose the first VLM-based physical 3D generative model, along with a new 3D representation that efficiently tokenizes geometry. It reduces the number of tokens by 193x, enabling explicit geometry learning within standard VLM token budgets without introducing any special tokens during fine-tuning and significantly improving generative quality. In addition, to overcome the limited diversity of existing physical 3D datasets, we construct a new dataset, PhysX-Mobility, which expands the object categories in prior physical 3D datasets by over 2x and includes more than 2K common real-world objects with rich physical annotations. Extensive experiments on PhysX-Mobility and in-the-wild images demonstrate that PhysX-Anything delivers strong generative performance and robust generalization. Furthermore, simulation-based experiments in a MuJoCo-style environment validate that our sim-ready assets can be directly used for contact-rich robotic policy learning. We believe PhysX-Anything can substantially empower a broad range of downstream applications, especially in embodied AI and physics-based simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://physx-anything.github.io/</p></details> |

We introduce FreeAskWorld, an interactive simulation framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for high-level behavior planning and semantically grounded interaction, informed by theories of intention and social cognition. Our framework supports scalable, realistic human-agent simulations and includes a modular data generation pipeline tailored for diverse embodied tasks.To validate the framework, we extend the classic Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task into a interaction enriched Direction Inquiry setting, wherein agents can actively seek and interpret navigational guidance. We present and publicly release FreeAskWorld, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising reconstructed environments, six diverse task types, 16 core object categories, 63,429 annotated sample frames, and more than 17 hours of interaction data to support training and evaluation of embodied AI systems. We benchmark VLN models, and human participants under both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on FreeAskWorld outperform their original counterparts, achieving enhanced semantic understanding and interaction competency. These findings underscore the efficacy of socially grounded simulation frameworks in advancing embodied AI systems toward sophisticated high-level planning and more naturalistic human-agent interaction. Importantly, our work underscores that interaction itself serves as an additional information modality.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Unlike narrative ladders, our scale is multi-axis and testable. We define ten capability axes (Autonomy, Generality, Planning, Memory/Persistence, Tool Economy, Self-Revision, Sociality/Coordination, Embodiment, World-Model Fidelity, Economic Throughput) aggregated by a composite AAI-Index (a weighted geometric mean). We introduce a measurable Self-Improvement Coefficient $κ$ (capability growth per unit of agent-initiated resources) and two closure properties (maintenance and expansion) that convert ``self-improving AI'' into falsifiable criteria. We specify OWA-Bench, an open-world agency benchmark suite that evaluates long-horizon, tool-using, persistent agents. We define level gates for AAI-0\ldots AAI-4 using thresholds on the axes, $κ$, and closure proofs. Synthetic experiments illustrate how present-day systems map onto the scale and how the delegability frontier (quality vs.\ autonomy) advances with self-improvement. We also prove a theorem that AAI-3 agent becomes AAI-5 over time with sufficient conditions, formalizing "baby AGI" becomes Superintelligence intuition.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent implicit nature of psychological processes, particularly those of clients, poses challenges to the authenticity and diversity of synthetic data. In this paper, we propose ECAs (short for Embodied Conversational Agents), a framework for embodied agent simulation based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that incorporates multiple psychological theoretical principles.Using simulation, we expand real counseling case data into a nuanced embodied cognitive memory space and generate dialogue data based on high-frequency counseling questions.We validated our framework using the D4 dataset. First, we created a public ECAs dataset through batch simulations based on D4. Licensed counselors evaluated our method, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms baselines in simulation authenticity and necessity. Additionally, two LLM-based automated evaluation methods were employed to confirm the higher quality of the generated dialogues compared to the baselines.

Yet-as Thomas Nagel's famous "What is it like to be a bat?" thought experiment highlights-human experience is constrained by our own sensorium and an irreducible gap in phenomenal access to nonhuman lifeworlds. This paper proposes More-than-Human through Human Augmentation (MtHtHA, denoted ">HtH+") as a design approach that repurposes human augmentation technologies-typically aimed at enhancing human capabilities-away from human optimization and exceptionalism but toward eco-phenomenological awareness. Grounded in somaesthetic design and eco-somatics, MtHtHA entails creating temporary, embodied experiences that modulate the human Umwelt to re-sensitize us to pluriversal more-than-human perceptions. We articulate seven design principles and report five design cases-EchoVision (bat-like echolocation), FeltSight (star-nosed-mole tactile navigation), FungiSync (fungal network attunement), TentacUs (octopus-like distributed agency), and City of Sparkles (urban data from AI's perspective). We demonstrate that such experiential "designing-with" can cultivate ecological awareness, empathy and obligations of care across species boundaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to DRS 2026</p></details> |

Achieving these capabilities requires a cohesive understanding of the environment, including object recognition to localize target objects, object affordances to identify potential interaction areas and spatial affordances to discern optimal areas for both object placement and robot movement. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level task planning and scene understanding, they often struggle to infer actionable positions for physical interaction, such as functional grasping points and permissible placement regions. This limitation stems from the lack of fine-grained annotations for object and spatial affordances in their training datasets. To tackle this challenge, we introduce RoboAfford++, a generative AI-enhanced dataset for multimodal affordance learning for both robotic manipulation and navigation. Our dataset comprises 869,987 images paired with 2.0 million question answering (QA) annotations, covering three critical tasks: object affordance recognition to identify target objects based on attributes and spatial relationships, object affordance prediction to pinpoint functional parts for manipulation, and spatial affordance localization to identify free space for object placement and robot navigation. Complementing this dataset, we propose RoboAfford-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing affordance-aware prediction in real-world scenarios, featuring 338 meticulously annotated samples across the same three tasks. Extensive experimental results reveal the deficiencies of existing VLMs in affordance learning, while fine-tuning on the RoboAfford++ dataset significantly enhances their ability to reason about object and spatial affordances, validating the dataset's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Reasoning Segmentation for Images and Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12368v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning segmentation enables open-set object segmentation via implicit text queries, therefore serving as a foundation for embodied agents that should operate autonomously in real-world environments. However, existing methods for reasoning segmentation require multimodal large language models with billions of parameters that exceed the computational capabilities of edge devices that typically deploy the embodied AI systems. Distillation offers a pathway to compress these models while preserving their capabilities. Yet, existing distillation approaches fail to transfer the multi-step reasoning capabilities that reasoning segmentation demands, as they focus on matching output predictions and intermediate features rather than preserving reasoning chains. The emerging paradigm of reasoning over digital twin representations presents an opportunity for more effective distillation by re-framing the problem. Consequently, we propose FastReasonSeg, which employs digital twin representations that decouple perception from reasoning to enable more effective distillation. Our distillation scheme first relies on supervised fine-tuning on teacher-generated reasoning chains. Then it is followed by reinforcement fine-tuning with joint rewards evaluating both segmentation accuracy and reasoning quality alignment. Experiments on two video (JiTBench, RVTBench) and two image benchmarks (ReasonSeg, LLM-Seg40K) demonstrate that our FastReasonSeg achieves state-of-the-art reasoning segmentation performance. Moreover, the distilled 0.6B variant outperforms models with 20 times more parameters while achieving 7.79 FPS throughput with only 2.1GB memory consumption. This efficiency enables deployment in resource-constrained environments to enable real-time reasoning segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIR-Bench: Evaluating Geospatial and Temporal Understanding of MLLMs via Travel Video Itinerary Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19002v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[SRSplat: Feed-Forward Super-Resolution Gaussian Splatting from Sparse Multi-View Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12040v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feed-forward 3D reconstruction from sparse, low-resolution (LR) images is a crucial capability for real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and embodied AI. However, existing methods often fail to recover fine texture details. This limitation stems from the inherent lack of high-frequency information in LR inputs. To address this, we propose \textbf{SRSplat}, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs high-resolution 3D scenes from only a few LR views. Our main insight is to compensate for the deficiency of texture information by jointly leveraging external high-quality reference images and internal texture cues. We first construct a scene-specific reference gallery, generated for each scene using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and diffusion models. To integrate this external information, we introduce the \textit{Reference-Guided Feature Enhancement (RGFE)} module, which aligns and fuses features from the LR input images and their reference twin image. Subsequently, we train a decoder to predict the Gaussian primitives using the multi-view fused feature obtained from \textit{RGFE}. To further refine predicted Gaussian primitives, we introduce \textit{Texture-Aware Density Control (TADC)}, which adaptively adjusts Gaussian density based on the internal texture richness of the LR inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SRSplat outperforms existing methods on various datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DTU, and exhibits strong cross-dataset and cross-resolution generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI2...</summary><p>AAAI2026-Oral.

We introduce SITE, a benchmark dataset towards SI Thorough Evaluation in a standardized format of multi-choice visual question-answering, designed to assess large vision-language models' spatial intelligence across diverse visual modalities (single-image, multi-image, and video) and SI factors (figural to environmental scales, spatial visualization and orientation, intrinsic and extrinsic, static and dynamic). Our approach to curating the benchmark combines a bottom-up survey about 31 existing datasets and a top-down strategy drawing upon three classification systems in cognitive science, which prompt us to design two novel types of tasks about view-taking and dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments reveal that leading models fall behind human experts especially in spatial orientation, a fundamental SI factor. Moreover, we demonstrate a positive correlation between a model's spatial reasoning proficiency and its performance on an embodied AI task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Our explicit mission is clearly stated as: To embed powerful intelligence into various embodiments. Pelican-VL 1.0 is currently the largest-scale open-source embodied multimodal brain model. Its core advantage lies in the in-depth integration of data power and intelligent adaptive learning mechanisms. Specifically, metaloop distilled a high-quality dataset from a raw dataset containing 4+ billion tokens. Pelican-VL 1.0 is trained on a large-scale cluster of 1000+ A800 GPUs, consuming over 50k+ A800 GPU-hours per checkpoint. This translates to a 20.3% performance uplift from its base model and outperforms 100B-level open-source counterparts by 10.6%, placing it on par with leading proprietary systems on well-known embodied benchmarks. We establish a novel framework, DPPO (Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization), inspired by human metacognition to train Pelican-VL 1.0. We operationalize this as a metaloop that teaches the AI to practice deliberately, which is a RL-Refine-Diagnose-SFT loop.</p></details> |  |

Cloud provider tools improve transparency but remain heterogeneous and often omit water and value chain effects, limiting comparability and reproducibility. Addressing these multi dimensional burdens requires a lifecycle approach linking phase explicit mapping with system levers (hardware, placement, energy mix, cooling, scheduling) and calibrated measurement across facility, system, device, and workload levels. This article (i) establishes a unified, operational definition of Green AI distinct from Sustainable AI; (ii) formalizes a five phase lifecycle mapped to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) stages, making energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts first class; (iii) specifies governance via Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycles with decision gateways; (iv) systematizes hardware and system level strategies across the edge cloud continuum to reduce embodied burdens; and (v) defines a calibrated measurement framework combining estimator models with direct metering to enable reproducible, provider agnostic comparisons. Combining definition, lifecycle processes, hardware strategies, and calibrated measurement, this article offers actionable, evidence based guidance for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.</p></details> |  |

Here we introduce EnvTrace, a simulation-based method that evaluates execution traces to assess semantic code equivalence. EnvTrace is demonstrated with a beamline control-logic digital twin to facilitate the evaluation of instrument control code, with the digital twin itself also enabling the pre-execution validation of live experiments. Over 30 LLMs were evaluated using trace alignment to generate a multi-faceted score for functional correctness across key behavioral dimensions, showing that many top-tier models can approach human-level performance in rapid control-code generation. This is a first step toward a broader vision where LLMs and digital twins work symbiotically: LLMs providing intuitive control and agentic orchestration, and digital twins offering safe and high-fidelity environments, paving the way towards autonomous embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Embodied Agentic AI: Review and Classification of LLM- and VLM-Driven Robot Autonomy and Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05294v4)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or large behavior models (LBMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of robotic systems. This survey paper reviews works that advance agentic applications and architectures, including initial efforts with GPT-style interfaces and more complex systems where AI agents function as coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fundamentals of Physical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09497v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is already published in Journal of Intelligent System of Systems Lifecycle Management</p></details> |

We present EAGLE, a novel framework that leverages episodic appearance- and geometry-aware memory to achieve unified 2D-3D visual query localization in egocentric vision. Inspired by avian memory consolidation, EAGLE synergistically integrates segmentation guided by an appearance-aware meta-learning memory (AMM), with tracking driven by a geometry-aware localization memory (GLM). This memory consolidation mechanism, through structured appearance and geometry memory banks, stores high-confidence retrieval samples, effectively supporting both long- and short-term modeling of target appearance variations. This enables precise contour delineation with robust spatial discrimination, leading to significantly improved retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, by integrating the VQL-2D output with a visual geometry grounded Transformer (VGGT), we achieve a efficient unification of 2D and 3D tasks, enabling rapid and accurate back-projection into 3D space. Our method achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the Ego4D-VQ benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, accepted by AAAI-2026</p></details> |

This growing adoption is expected to increase the associated lifecycle carbon footprint, including both \emph{operational carbon} from training and inference and \emph{embodied carbon} from AI hardware manufacturing. We introduce \ourframework -- the first carbon-aware co-optimization framework for Transformer-based models and hardware accelerators. By integrating both operational and embodied carbon into early-stage design space exploration, \ourframework enables sustainability-driven model architecture and hardware accelerator co-design that reveals fundamentally different trade-offs than latency- or energy-centric approaches. Evaluated across a range of Transformer models, \ourframework consistently demonstrates the potential to reduce total carbon emissions -- by up to 30\% -- while maintaining accuracy and latency. We further highlight its extensibility through a focused case study on multi-modal models. Our results emphasize the need for holistic optimization methods that prioritize carbon efficiency without compromising model capability and execution time performance.

| **[Towards Affordance-Aware Robotic Dexterous Grasping with Human-like Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08896v4)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage, a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects, unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents -- virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.

The system combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation with DALL-E 3 text-to-image generation, creating consistent VGA-style visuals as players embody Malinowski during his Trobriand Islands fieldwork (1915-1918). To address ethical concerns, indigenous peoples appear as silhouettes while Malinowski is detailed, prompting reflection on anthropological representation. Two validation studies confirmed effectiveness: Study 1 with 10 non-specialists showed strong learning outcomes (average quiz score 7.5/10) and excellent usability (SUS: 83/100). Study 2 with 4 expert anthropologists confirmed pedagogical value, with one senior researcher discovering "new aspects" of Malinowski's work through gameplay. The findings demonstrate that AI-driven educational games can effectively convey complex anthropological concepts while sparking disciplinary curiosity. This study advances AI-native educational game design and provides a replicable model for transforming academic texts into engaging interactive experiences.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures.

However, safety regulations and operational constraints in operating rooms (ORs) limit embodied agents from freely perceiving and interacting in realistic settings. Digital twins provide high-fidelity, risk-free environments for exploration and training. How we may create photorealistic and dynamic digital representations of ORs that capture relevant spatial, visual, and behavioral complexity remains unclear. We introduce TwinOR, a framework for constructing photorealistic, dynamic digital twins of ORs for embodied AI research. The system reconstructs static geometry from pre-scan videos and continuously models human and equipment motion through multi-view perception of OR activities. The static and dynamic components are fused into an immersive 3D environment that supports controllable simulation and embodied exploration. The proposed framework reconstructs complete OR geometry with centimeter level accuracy while preserving dynamic interaction across surgical workflows, enabling realistic renderings and a virtual playground for embodied AI systems. In our experiments, TwinOR simulates stereo and monocular sensor streams for geometry understanding and visual localization tasks. Models such as FoundationStereo and ORB-SLAM3 on TwinOR-synthesized data achieve performance within their reported accuracy on real indoor datasets, demonstrating that TwinOR provides sensor-level realism sufficient for perception and localization challenges. By establishing a real-to-sim pipeline for constructing dynamic, photorealistic digital twins of OR environments, TwinOR enables the safe, scalable, and data-efficient development and benchmarking of embodied AI, ultimately accelerating the deployment of embodied AI from sim-to-real.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement this diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and compare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we investigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing, co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions. Through systematic evaluation, our work not only demonstrates the critical importance of preserving VLM priors for the generalization of VLA but also establishes guidelines for future research in developing truly generalizable embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

To address the challenges of scalability and expertise dependence, we present Data Agent, a fully autonomous system specialized for tabular data. Leveraging large language model (LLM) reasoning and grounded validation, Data Agent automatically performs data cleaning, hierarchical routing, and feature-level optimization through dual feedback loops. It embodies three core principles: automatic, safe, and non-expert friendly, which ensure end-to-end reliability without human supervision.

Furthermore, we discuss the emerging trends of using spatial understanding, modeling world dynamics, post training, and data synthesis -- all aiming to reach these milestones.

However, developers face a critical gap: the Platform for Situated Intelligence (psi), which excels at deterministic temporal alignment and multimodal data management, has been largely inaccessible to the dominant Unity/MRTK ecosystem used for HoloLens development. We introduce psiUnity, an open-source C# integration that bridges psi's .NET libraries with Unity 2022.3 and MRTK3 for HoloLens 2. psiUnity enables bidirectional, real-time streaming of head pose, hand tracking, gaze, IMU, audio, and depth sensor data (AHAT and long-throw) with microsecond-level temporal precision, allowing Unity applications to both consume and produce synchronized multimodal data streams. By embedding psi's native serialization, logging, and temporal coordination directly within Unity's architecture, psiUnity extends psi beyond its previous StereoKit limitations and empowers the HRI, HCI, and embodied-AI communities to develop reproducible, data-driven XR interactions and experiments within the familiar Unity environment. The integration is available at https://github.com/sailgt/psiUnity.</p></details> |  |
| **[iFlyBot-VLM Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04976v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce iFlyBot-VLM, a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (VLM) used to improve the domain of Embodied Intelligence. The central objective of iFlyBot-VLM is to bridge the cross-modal semantic gap between high-dimensional environmental perception and low-level robotic motion control. To this end, the model abstracts complex visual and spatial information into a body-agnostic and transferable Operational Language, thereby enabling seamless perception-action closed-loop coordination across diverse robotic platforms. The architecture of iFlyBot-VLM is systematically designed to realize four key functional capabilities essential for embodied intelligence: 1) Spatial Understanding and Metric Reasoning; 2) Interactive Target Grounding; 3) Action Abstraction and Control Parameter Generation; 4) Task Planning and Skill Sequencing. We envision iFlyBot-VLM as a scalable and generalizable foundation model for embodied AI, facilitating the progression from specialized task-oriented systems toward generalist, cognitively capable agents. We conducted evaluations on 10 current mainstream embodied intelligence-related VLM benchmark datasets, such as Blink and Where2Place, and achieved optimal performance while preserving the model's general capabilities. We will publicly release both the training data and model weights to foster further research and development in the field of Embodied Intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Action Deviation-Aware Inference for Low-Latency Wireless Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02851v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML with computational resources in mobile, edge, and cloud connected over hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: a lightweight on-device model locally generates drafts while a more capable remote target model on a server verifies and corrects them in parallel with speculative sampling, thus resulting in lower latency without compromising accuracy. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each generated action depends on observation updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference (ADAHI), wherein drafts are selectively transmitted and verified based on action deviation, which has a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model. By invoking server operation only when necessary, communication and computational overhead can be reduced while accuracy gain from speculative sampling is preserved. Experiments on our testbed show that ADAHI reduces transmission and server operations by approximately 40%, lowers end-to-end latency by 39.2%, and attains up to 97.2% of the task-success rate of baseline that invokes speculative sampling for every draft embedding vector.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are We Aligned? A Preliminary Investigation of the Alignment of Responsible AI Values between LLMs and Human Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04157v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in software engineering tasks such as requirements elicitation, design, and evaluation, raising critical questions regarding their alignment with human judgments on responsible AI values. This study investigates how closely LLMs' value preferences align with those of two human groups: a US-representative sample and AI practitioners. We evaluate 23 LLMs across four tasks: (T1) selecting key responsible AI values, (T2) rating their importance in specific contexts, (T3) resolving trade-offs between competing values, and (T4) prioritizing software requirements that embody those values. The results show that LLMs generally align more closely with AI practitioners than with the US-representative sample, emphasizing fairness, privacy, transparency, safety, and accountability. However, inconsistencies appear between the values that LLMs claim to uphold (Tasks 1-3) and the way they prioritize requirements (Task 4), revealing gaps in faithfulness between stated and applied behavior. These findings highlight the practical risk of relying on LLMs in requirements engineering without human oversight and motivate the need for systematic approaches to benchmark, interpret, and monitor value alignment in AI-assisted software development.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysCorr: Dual-Reward DPO for Physics-Constrained Text-to-Video Generation with Automated Preference Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03997v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics, incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaRF: Enhancing Multi-View Consistency in Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03992v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically, CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization. Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively. Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and autonomous perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROSBag MCP Server: Analyzing Robot Data with LLMs for Agentic Embodied AI Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03497v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.

| **[EQ-Negotiator: Dynamic Emotional Personas Empower Small Language Models for Edge-Deployable Credit Negotiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03370v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in automated negotiation has set a high performance benchmark, but their computational cost and data privacy requirements render them unsuitable for many privacy-sensitive, on-device applications such as mobile assistants, embodied AI agents or private client interactions. While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative, they suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing emotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This paper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability gap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates game theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional states online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs with the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating conflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent simulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial debtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show that a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its size. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles to dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints. Besides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw model scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation, paving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators that can operate on the edge.</p></details> |  |

It is a fundamental mode of human creativity spanning music, dance, and everyday life. The open-ended nature of improvisation produces a stream of novel, unrepeatable moments-an aspect highly valued in artistic creativity. In parallel, open-endedness (OE)-a system's capacity for unbounded novelty and endless "interestingness"-is exemplified in natural or cultural evolution and has been considered "the last grand challenge" in artificial life (ALife). The rise of generative AI now raises the question in computational creativity (CC) research: What makes a "good" improvisation for AI? Can AI learn to improvise in a genuinely open-ended way? In this work-in-progress paper, we report insights from in-depth interviews with 6 experts in improvisation across dance, music, and contact improvisation. We draw systemic connections between human improvisational arts and the design of future experiential AI agents that could improvise alone or alongside humans-or even with other AI agents-embodying qualities of improvisation drawn from practice: active listening (umwelt and awareness), being in the time (mindfulness and ephemerality), embracing the unknown (source of randomness and serendipity), non-judgmental flow (acceptance and dynamical stability, balancing structure and surprise (unpredictable criticality at edge of chaos), imaginative metaphor (synaesthesia and planning), empathy, trust, boundary, and care (mutual theory of mind), and playfulness and intrinsic motivation (maintaining interestingness).</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI 2026 Creative AI for Live Interactive Performances Workshop (CLIP) as a work-in-progress paper</p></details> |

This diversity in objectives, modality, and technical stacks creates an urgent need for a unified framework. To address this gap, this paper systematizes the field by proposing a Four-Quadrant Technical Taxonomy for AI companion applications. The framework is structured along two critical axes: Virtual vs. Embodied and Emotional Companionship vs. Functional Augmentation. Quadrant I (Virtual Companionship) explores virtual idols, romantic companions, and story characters, introducing a four-layer technical framework to analyze their challenges in maintaining long-term emotional consistency. Quadrant II (Functional Virtual Assistants) analyzes AI applications in work, gaming, and mental health, highlighting the shift from "feeling" to "thinking and acting" and pinpointing key technologies like enterprise RAG and on-device inference. Quadrants III & IV (Embodied Intelligence) shift from the virtual to the physical world, analyzing home robots and vertical-domain assistants, revealing core challenges in symbol grounding, data privacy, and ethical liability. This taxonomy provides not only a systematic map for researchers and developers to navigate the complex persona design space but also a basis for policymakers to identify and address the unique risks inherent in different application scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Neurips 2025 workshop: LLM Persona Workshop</p></details> |

In particular, traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda embody centuries of nuanced textual and clinical knowledge that mainstream LLMs fail to accurately interpret or apply. We introduce AyurParam-2.9B, a domain-specialized, bilingual language model fine-tuned from Param-1-2.9B using an extensive, expertly curated Ayurveda dataset spanning classical texts and clinical guidance. AyurParam's dataset incorporates context-aware, reasoning, and objective-style Q&A in both English and Hindi, with rigorous annotation protocols for factual precision and instructional clarity. Benchmarked on BhashaBench-Ayur, AyurParam not only surpasses all open-source instruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5--3B parameters), but also demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to much larger models. The results from AyurParam highlight the necessity for authentic domain adaptation and high-quality supervision in delivering reliable, culturally congruent AI for specialized medical knowledge.</p></details> |  |

A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), which uses the agent's own policy to simulate future states. A Message Generation Network (MGN) then compresses this plan into a message. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems, while scaling environmental complexity. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

However, most object-centric RL methods factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular interaction learning is crucial for robust control.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Human-AI Co-Embodied Intelligence for Scientific Experimentation and Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02071v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific experiment and manufacture rely on complex, multi-step procedures that demand continuous human expertise for precise execution and decision-making. Despite advances in machine learning and automation, conventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world experiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This gap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility, scalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows. Here, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI that unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated system for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm, humans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes memory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The wearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture processes, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for corrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we present Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic reasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and interprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures, provides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large language models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to beginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human intelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce Aria-Duet, an interactive system facilitating a real-time musical duet between a human pianist and Aria, a state-of-the-art generative model, using a Yamaha Disklavier as a shared physical interface. The framework enables a turn-taking collaboration: the user performs, signals a handover, and the model generates a coherent continuation performed acoustically on the piano. Beyond describing the technical architecture enabling this low-latency interaction, we analyze the system's output from a musicological perspective, finding the model can maintain stylistic semantics and develop coherent phrasal ideas, demonstrating that such embodied systems can engage in musically sophisticated dialogue and open a promising new path for human-AI co-creation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose \textbf{URDF-Anything}, an end-to-end automatic reconstruction framework based on a 3D multimodal large language model (MLLM). URDF-Anything utilizes an autoregressive prediction framework based on point-cloud and text multimodal input to jointly optimize geometric segmentation and kinematic parameter prediction. It implements a specialized $[SEG]$ token mechanism that interacts directly with point cloud features, enabling fine-grained part-level segmentation while maintaining consistency with the kinematic parameter predictions. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches regarding geometric segmentation (mIoU 17\% improvement), kinematic parameter prediction (average error reduction of 29\%), and physical executability (surpassing baselines by 50\%). Notably, our method exhibits excellent generalization ability, performing well even on objects outside the training set. This work provides an efficient solution for constructing digital twins for robotic simulation, significantly enhancing the sim-to-real transfer capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

Large multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However, systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space. We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning.

The AT defence embodies several common concurrent misconceptions that pile on each other: the belief that Turing machines impose artefactual constraints, the mischaracterisation of Kolmogorov complexity as inapplicable, and the claims around Ai as different from Shannon entropy or compression algorithms. Here we show that the new arguments advanced by the AT group in their defence, are based on misleading and incomplete experiments that, when completed, show the extent of the correlations and overlapping with popular statistical compression algorithms, conforming with the mathematical equivalence to Shannon entropy previously mathematically proved and reported, which remains undisputed. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that Ai does not offer a path towards fundamental novel causal or informational insights beyond what existing statistical frameworks already offer. Rather than offering a unifying theory of life as the AT authors suggest, we argue that AT obfuscates the field and provides a cautionary example of how the accumulation of conceptual mistakes can lead to a misleading theory. Finally, we show that Ai is a particular limited case of another complexity metric based on algorithmic (Kolmogorov) complexity, consisting of decomposing an object into its causal blocks that goes beyond, and outperforms, AT.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 fi...</summary><p>10 figures, 60 pages (reorganization after peer review)</p></details> |

Existing vision_language models (VLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning due to their implicit, correlation-driven reasoning and reliance solely on images. We propose a novel neuro_symbolic framework that integrates both panoramic-image and 3D point cloud information, combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning to explicitly model spatial and logical relationships. Our framework consists of a perception module for detecting entities and extracting attributes, and a reasoning module that constructs a structured scene graph to support precise, interpretable queries. Evaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, our approach demonstrates superior performance and reliability in crowded, human_built environments while maintaining a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI applications.</p></details> |  |

Sub-symbolic machine learning algorithms, such as the LLMs, simulate reasoning but hallucinate and their decisions cannot be explained or audited (crucial aspects for trustworthiness). On the other hand, rule-based reasoners, such as Cyc, are able to provide the chain of reasoning steps but are complex and use a large number of reasoners. We propose a middle ground using s(CASP), a goal-directed constraint-based answer set programming reasoner that employs a small number of mechanisms to emulate reliable and explainable human-style commonsense reasoning. In this paper, we explain how s(CASP) supports the 16 desiderata for trustworthy AI introduced by Doug Lenat and Gary Marcus (2023), and two additional ones: inconsistency detection and the assumption of alternative worlds. To illustrate the feasibility and synergies of s(CASP), we present a range of diverse applications, including a conversational chatbot and a virtually embodied reasoner.</p></details> |  |

At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI.

To address this tension, a coach-like LLM environment was developed that embodies divergent and convergent thinking personas as two complementary processes. Effectiveness and user behavior were assessed through a controlled experiment in which participants interacted with either persona, while a control group engaged with a standard LLM providing direct answers. Notably, users' perceptions of which persona best supported their creativity often diverged from objective performance measures. Trait-based analyses revealed that individual differences predict when people utilize divergent versus convergent personas, suggesting opportunities for adaptive sequencing. Furthermore, interaction patterns reflected the design thinking model, demonstrating how persona-guided support shapes creative problem-solving. Our findings provide design principles for creativity support systems that strike a balance between exploration and convergence through persona-based guidance and personalization. These insights advance human-AI collaboration tools that scaffold rather than overshadow human creativity.</p></details> |  |

While transferring into hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Built on a flow-based architecture, [Cosmos-Predict2.5] unifies Text2World, Image2World, and Video2World generation in a single model and leverages [Cosmos-Reason1], a Physical AI vision-language model, to provide richer text grounding and finer control of world simulation. Trained on 200M curated video clips and refined with reinforcement learning-based post-training, [Cosmos-Predict2.5] achieves substantial improvements over [Cosmos-Predict1] in video quality and instruction alignment, with models released at 2B and 14B scales. These capabilities enable more reliable synthetic data generation, policy evaluation, and closed-loop simulation for robotics and autonomous systems. We further extend the family with [Cosmos-Transfer2.5], a control-net style framework for Sim2Real and Real2Real world translation. Despite being 3.5$\times$ smaller than [Cosmos-Transfer1], it delivers higher fidelity and robust long-horizon video generation. Together, these advances establish [Cosmos-Predict2.5] and [Cosmos-Transfer2.5] as versatile tools for scaling embodied intelligence. To accelerate research and deployment in Physical AI, we release source code, pretrained checkpoints, and curated benchmarks under the NVIDIA Open Model License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2.5 and https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer2.5. We hope these open resources lower the barrier to adoption and foster innovation in building the next generation of embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |

HAI aims to better serve human welfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of robots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex task planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up new pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents often lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control tasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic manipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical world. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises a human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an action execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a vision-based task planner, a natural language instruction converter, and a task performance feedback evaluator. Experimental results demonstrate that our agent achieves a 28\% higher average task success rate in both simulated and real environments compared to approaches relying solely on LLM+CLIP, significantly improving the execution success rate of high-level natural language instruction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Pipelines: A Survey of the Paradigm Shift toward Model-Native Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16720v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial intelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but act, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm, where these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey systematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory -- has evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors. Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments outline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing systems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence through experience.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

While diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and video generation, many of their inference strategies have been directly transferred to control domains without adaptation. In this work, we show that by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied AI tasks -- particularly structured, low-dimensional nature of action distributions -- diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as 5 neural function evaluations (NFE). Building on this insight, we propose a population-based sampling strategy, genetic denoising, which enhances both performance and stability by selecting denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk. Our method solves challenging tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. We evaluate our approach across 14 robotic manipulation tasks from D4RL and Robomimic, spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets. In over 2 million evaluations, our method consistently outperforms standard diffusion-based policies, achieving up to 20\% performance gains with significantly fewer inference steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figure, 2 tables, accepted at Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[MEReQ: Max-Ent Residual-Q Inverse RL for Sample-Efficient Alignment from Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16258v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning robot behavior with human preferences is crucial for deploying embodied AI agents in human-centered environments. A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

However, current large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model (GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency. For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks, highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data, model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at https://zterobot.github.io/EmbodiedBrain.github.io.</p></details> |  |

It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://directlayout.github.io/</p></details> |

World simulators provide such environments but face distinct limitations: video-based methods generate diverse content but lack real-time physics feedback for interactive learning, while physics-based engines provide accurate dynamics but face scalability limitations from costly manual asset creation. We present Seed3D 1.0, a foundation model that generates simulation-ready 3D assets from single images, addressing the scalability challenge while maintaining physics rigor. Unlike existing 3D generation models, our system produces assets with accurate geometry, well-aligned textures, and realistic physically-based materials. These assets can be directly integrated into physics engines with minimal configuration, enabling deployment in robotic manipulation and simulation training. Beyond individual objects, the system scales to complete scene generation through assembling objects into coherent environments. By enabling scalable simulation-ready content creation, Seed3D 1.0 provides a foundation for advancing physics-based world simulators.

Yet, researchers are often sidetracked by the manual, repetitive chore of building project webpages to make their dense papers accessible. While automation has tackled static slides and posters, the dynamic, interactive nature of webpages has remained an unaddressed challenge. To bridge this gap, we reframe the problem, arguing that the solution lies not in a single command, but in a collaborative, hierarchical process. We introduce $\textbf{AutoPage}$, a novel multi-agent system that embodies this philosophy. AutoPage deconstructs paper-to-page creation into a coarse-to-fine pipeline from narrative planning to multimodal content generation and interactive rendering. To combat AI hallucination, dedicated "Checker" agents verify each step against the source paper, while optional human checkpoints ensure the final product aligns perfectly with the author's vision, transforming the system from a mere tool into a powerful collaborative assistant. To rigorously validate our approach, we also construct $\textbf{PageBench}$, the first benchmark for this new task. Experiments show AutoPage not only generates high-quality, visually appealing pages but does so with remarkable efficiency in under 15 minutes for less than \$0.1. Code and dataset will be released at $\href{https://mqleet.github.io/AutoPage_ProjectPage/}{Webpage}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing Across Views: Benchmarking Spatial Reasoning of Vision-Language Models in Robotic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19400v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project and benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/MV-RoboBench</p></details> |

A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned from limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural network-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that paradoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper introduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization. Specifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it transforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal calibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii) it reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization problem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments. Extensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation tasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in generalization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |

While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://faceong.github.io/VIKI-R/</p></details> |

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the methodologies enabling LLMs to process, understand, and generate 3D data. Highlighting the unique advantages of LLMs, such as in-context learning, step-by-step reasoning, open-vocabulary capabilities, and extensive world knowledge, we underscore their potential to significantly advance spatial comprehension and interaction within embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Our investigation spans various 3D data representations, from point clouds to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). It examines their integration with LLMs for tasks such as 3D scene understanding, captioning, question-answering, and dialogue, as well as LLM-based agents for spatial reasoning, planning, and navigation. The paper also includes a brief review of other methods that integrate 3D and language. The meta-analysis presented in this paper reveals significant progress yet underscores the necessity for novel approaches to harness the full potential of 3D-LLMs. Hence, with this paper, we aim to chart a course for future research that explores and expands the capabilities of 3D-LLMs in understanding and interacting with the complex 3D world.

To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has led to a growing demand for AI-enabled wireless networks. The open-source DeepSeek models are famous for their innovative designs, such as large-scale pure RL and cost-efficient training, which make them well-suited for practical deployment in wireless networks. By integrating DeepSeek-style LLMs with wireless infrastructures, a synergistic opportunity arises: the DeepSeek-style LLMs enhance network optimization with strong reasoning and decision-making abilities, while wireless infrastructure enables the broad deployment of these models. Motivated by this convergence, this survey presents a comprehensive DeepSeek-inspired exploration of RL-based LLMs in the context of wireless networks. We begin by reviewing key techniques behind network optimization to establish a foundation for understanding DeepSeek-style LLM integration. Next, we examine recent advancements in RL-based LLMs, using DeepSeek models as a representative example. Building on this, we explore the synergy between the two domains, highlighting motivations, challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we highlight emerging directions for integrating LLMs with wireless networks, such as quantum, on-device, and neural-symbolic LLM models, as well as embodied AI agents. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive examination of the interplay between DeepSeek-style LLMs and wireless networks, demonstrating how these domains can mutually enhance each other to drive innovation.</p></details> | 45 pages, 12 figures |

A prerequisite for embodied agents deployed in real world interactions ought to be training with interaction, yet today's most successful AI models (e.g., VLMs, LLMs) are trained without an explicit notion of action. The problem of pure exploration (which assumes no data as input) is well studied in the reinforcement learning literature and provides agents with a wide array of experiences, yet it fails to prepare them for rapid adaptation to new tasks. Today's language and vision models are trained on data provided by humans, which provides a strong inductive bias for the sorts of tasks that the model will have to solve (e.g., modeling chords in a song, phrases in a sonnet, sentences in a medical record). However, when they are prompted to solve a new task, there is a faulty tacit assumption that humans spend most of their time in the most rewarding states. The key contribution of our paper is a method for pre-training interactive agents in a self-supervised fashion, so that they can instantly mimic human demonstrations. Our method treats goals (i.e., observations) as the atomic construct. During training, our method automatically proposes goals and practices reaching them, building off prior work in reinforcement learning exploration. During evaluation, our method solves an (amortized) inverse reinforcement learning problem to explain demonstrations as optimal goal-reaching behavior. Experiments on standard benchmarks (not designed for goal-reaching) show that our approach outperforms prior methods for zero-shot imitation.</p></details> |  |

This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/visper_lm/</p></details> |

Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware, interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

Despite recent progress in video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking. Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG, particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.</p></details> |  |

While such models support users in a variety of creative tasks, they lack the embodied nature of human interaction. Dance, as a primal form of human expression, is predestined to complement this experience. To explore creative human-AI interaction exemplified by dance, we build an interactive model based on motion capture (MoCap) data. It generates an artificial other by partially mimicking and also "creatively" enhancing an incoming sequence of movement data. It is the first model, which leverages single-person motion data and high level features in order to do so and, thus, it does not rely on low level human-human interaction data. It combines ideas of two diffusion models, motion inpainting, and motion style transfer to generate movement representations that are both temporally coherent and responsive to a chosen movement reference. The success of the model is demonstrated by quantitatively assessing the convergence of the feature distribution of the generated samples and the test set which serves as simulating the human performer. We show that our generations are first steps to creative dancing with AI as they are both diverse showing various deviations from the human partner while appearing realistic.</p></details> |  |

Towards this vision, we focus on the innovative task where, given ego-streaming video input, an assistant proactively answers diverse, evolving questions at the opportune moment, while maintaining synchronized perception and reasoning. This task embodies three key properties: (1) Proactive Coherence, (2) Just-in-Time Responsiveness, and (3) Synchronized Efficiency. To evaluate and address these properties, we first introduce ESTP-Bench (Ego Streaming Proactive Benchmark) alongside the ESTP-F1 metric-a novel framework designed for their rigorous assessment.

This pipeline comprises: (1) a data engine, (2) a multi-stage training strategy, and (3) a proactive dynamic compression technique.

As these agents proliferate across virtual and physical environments, from virtual assistants to embodied robots, the need for a unified, agent-centric infrastructure becomes paramount. In this survey, we introduce the Internet of Agents (IoA) as a foundational framework that enables seamless interconnection, dynamic discovery, and collaborative orchestration among heterogeneous agents at scale. We begin by presenting a general IoA architecture, highlighting its hierarchical organization, distinguishing features relative to the traditional Internet, and emerging applications. Next, we analyze the key operational enablers of IoA, including capability notification and discovery, adaptive communication protocols, dynamic task matching, consensus and conflict-resolution mechanisms, and incentive models.

As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Project Page: https://cl-splats.github.io</p></details> |

This can present a number of challenges including linguistic barriers (Ullah et al., 2021), cultural differences in learning style (Omidvar & Tan, 2012), cultural sensitivity in course design (Nguyen, 2022) and perceived isolation when students feel their perspectives or experiences are not reflected or valued in the learning environment (Hansen-Brown et al., 2022). Ensuring active engagement and reasonable learning outcomes in such a environments requires distance educational systems that are not only adaptive but also culturally resonant (Dalle et al., 2024). Both embodied and virtual AI-Agents have great potential in this regard as they can facilitate personalized learning and adapt their interactions and content delivery to align with students' cultural context. In addition, Generative AI (GAI), such as, Large Language Models (LLMs) can amplify the potential for these culturally aware AI agents to address educational challenges due to their advanced capacity for understanding and generating contextually relevant content (Wang et al., 2024). This chapter reviews existing research and suggests the usage of culturally aware AI-Agents, powered by GAI, to foster engagement and improve learning outcomes in culturally diverse online higher education environments.</p></details> |  |

Yet most video QA models rely on single-pass perception over fixed frames, leading to hallucinations and failures on fine-grained evidence. Inspired by how humans pause, zoom, and re-read critical regions, we introduce Video-R4 (Reinforcing Text-Rich Video Reasoning with Visual Rumination), a video reasoning LMM that performs visual rumination: iteratively selecting frames, zooming into informative regions, re-encoding retrieved pixels, and updating its reasoning state. We construct two datasets with executable rumination trajectories: Video-R4-CoT-17k for supervised practice and Video-R4-RL-30k for reinforcement learning. We propose a multi-stage rumination learning framework that progressively finetunes a 7B LMM to learn atomic and mixing visual operations via SFT and GRPO-based RL. Video-R4-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on M4-ViteVQA and further generalizes to multi-page document QA, slides QA, and generic video QA, demonstrating that iterative rumination is an effective paradigm for pixel-grounded multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Data from Clustered LQR Systems: Personalized and Collaborative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17489v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is known that reinforcement learning (RL) is data-hungry. To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes. From a distributed implementation perspective, our method is attractive as it incurs only a mild logarithmic communication overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[ID-Crafter: VLM-Grounded Online RL for Compositional Multi-Subject Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00511v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant progress has been achieved in high-fidelity video synthesis, yet current paradigms often fall short in effectively integrating identity information from multiple subjects. This leads to semantic conflicts and suboptimal performance in preserving identities and interactions, limiting controllability and applicability. To tackle this issue, we introduce ID-Crafter, a framework for multi-subject video generation that achieves superior identity preservation and semantic coherence. ID-Crafter integrates three key components: (i) a hierarchical identity-preserving attention mechanism that progressively aggregates features at intra-subject, inter-subject, and cross-modal levels; (ii) a semantic understanding module powered by a pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM) to provide fine-grained guidance and capture complex inter-subject relationships; and (iii) an online reinforcement learning phase to further refine the model for critical concepts. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset to facilitate robust training and evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ID-Crafter establishes new state-of-the-art performance on multi-subject video generation benchmarks, excelling in identity preservation, temporal consistency, and overall video quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Reward Optimization for Machine Translation using Error Severity Mappings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05986v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been proven to be an effective and robust method for training neural machine translation systems, especially when paired with powerful reward models that accurately assess translation quality. However, most research has focused on RL methods that use sentence-level feedback, leading to inefficient learning signals due to the reward sparsity problem -- the model receives a single score for the entire sentence. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages fine-grained, token-level quality assessments along with error severity levels using RL methods. Specifically, we use xCOMET, a state-of-the-art quality estimation system, as our token-level reward model. We conduct experiments on small and large translation datasets with standard encoder-decoder and large language models-based machine translation systems, comparing the impact of sentence-level versus fine-grained reward signals on translation quality. Our results show that training with token-level rewards improves translation quality across language pairs over baselines according to both automatic and human evaluation. Furthermore, token-level reward optimization improves training stability, evidenced by a steady increase in mean rewards over training epochs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked-and-Reordered Self-Supervision for Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17473v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling has been shown to substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning. However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings.</p></details> |  |

MVDPDPSR is an extension of the vehicle routing problem and a spatio-temporal system optimization problem, widely applied in scenarios such as on-demand delivery. Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration. Experiments on 8 datasets demonstrate that MAPT significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of performance and exhibits substantial computational time advantages compared to classical operations research methods.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Concise Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05185v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major drawback of reasoning models is their excessive token usage, inflating computational cost, resource demand, and latency. We show this verbosity stems not from deeper reasoning but from reinforcement learning loss minimization when models produce incorrect answers. With unsolvable problems dominating training, this effect compounds into a systematic tendency toward longer outputs. Through theoretical analysis of PPO and GRPO, we prove that incorrect answers inherently drive policies toward verbosity \textit{even when} $γ=1$, reframing response lengthening as an optimization artifact. We further uncover a consistent correlation between conciseness and correctness across reasoning and non-reasoning models. Building on these insights, we propose a two-phase RL procedure where a brief secondary stage, trained on a small set of solvable problems, significantly reduces response length while preserving or improving accuracy. Finally, we show that while GRPO shares properties with PPO, it exhibits collapse modes, limiting its reliability for concise reasoning. Our claims are supported by extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value of Information-Enhanced Exploration in Bootstrapped DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02969v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient exploration in deep reinforcement learning remains a fundamental challenge, especially in environments characterized by high-dimensional states and sparse rewards. Traditional exploration strategies that rely on random local policy noise, such as $ε$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration methods, often struggle to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we integrate the notion of (expected) value of information (EVOI) within the well-known Bootstrapped DQN algorithmic framework, to enhance the algorithm's deep exploration ability. Specifically, we develop two novel algorithms that incorporate the expected gain from learning the value of information into Bootstrapped DQN. Our methods use value of information estimates to measure the discrepancies of opinions among distinct network heads, and drive exploration towards areas with the most potential. We evaluate our algorithms with respect to performance and their ability to exploit inherent uncertainty arising from random network initialization. Our experiments in complex, sparse-reward Atari games demonstrate increased performance, all the while making better use of uncertainty, and, importantly, without introducing extra hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[MorphSeek: Fine-grained Latent Representation-Level Policy Optimization for Deformable Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17392v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deformable image registration (DIR) remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in medical image analysis, largely due to the prohibitively high-dimensional deformation space of dense displacement fields and the scarcity of voxel-level supervision. Existing reinforcement learning frameworks often project this space into coarse, low-dimensional representations, limiting their ability to capture spatially variant deformations. We propose MorphSeek, a fine-grained representation-level policy optimization paradigm that reformulates DIR as a spatially continuous optimization process in the latent feature space. MorphSeek introduces a stochastic Gaussian policy head atop the encoder to model a distribution over latent features, facilitating efficient exploration and coarse-to-fine refinement. The framework integrates unsupervised warm-up with weakly supervised fine-tuning through Group Relative Policy Optimization, where multi-trajectory sampling stabilizes training and improves label efficiency. Across three 3D registration benchmarks (OASIS brain MRI, LiTS liver CT, and Abdomen MR-CT), MorphSeek achieves consistent Dice improvements over competitive baselines while maintaining high label efficiency with minimal parameter cost and low step-level latency overhead. Beyond optimizer specifics, MorphSeek advances a representation-level policy learning paradigm that achieves spatially coherent and data-efficient deformation optimization, offering a principled, backbone-agnostic, and optimizer-agnostic solution for scalable visual alignment in high-dimensional settings.</p></details> |  |

We propose a lightweight framework that combines a gait generator network learned from human motion with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) controller for torque control. Despite being trained only on flat or mildly sloped ground, the learned policies generalize to steeper ramps and rough surfaces. Results suggest that pairing spectral motion priors with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a practical path toward natural and robust bipedal locomotion with modest training cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[R2PS: Worst-Case Robust Real-Time Pursuit Strategies under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17367v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing worst-case robust strategies in pursuit-evasion games (PEGs) is time-consuming, especially when real-world factors like partial observability are considered. While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies. After reinforcement learning, our policy achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world graph structures and consistently outperforms the policy directly trained on the test graphs by the existing game RL approach.</p></details> |  |

This leads to new State-of-the-Art performance on the recent MMAU and MMAR benchmarks. Omni-R1 achieves the highest accuracies on the sounds, music, speech, and overall average categories, both on the Test-mini and Test-full splits. To understand the performance improvement, we tested models both with and without audio and found that much of the performance improvement from GRPO could be attributed to better text-based reasoning. We also made a surprising discovery that fine-tuning without audio on a text-only dataset was effective at improving the audio-based performance.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a Feudal Q-learning scheme and investigate under which conditions its coupled updates converge and are stable. By leveraging the theory of Stochastic Approximation and the ODE method, we present a theorem stating the convergence and stability properties of Feudal Q-learning. This provides a principled convergence and stability analysis tailored to Feudal RL. Moreover, we show that the updates converge to a point that can be interpreted as an equilibrium of a suitably defined game, opening the door to game-theoretic approaches to Hierarchical RL. Lastly, experiments based on the Feudal Q-learning algorithm support the outcomes anticipated by theory.</p></details> |  |

This capability is essential for large-scale chemical data mining, drug discovery pipelines, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications in related domains. However, existing OCSR systems face significant challenges in accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to the subtle visual cues that distinguish stereoisomers, such as wedge and dash bonds, ring conformations, and spatial arrangements. To address these challenges, we propose MolSight, a comprehensive learning framework for OCSR that employs a three-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, we conduct pre-training on large-scale but noisy datasets to endow the model with fundamental perception capabilities for chemical structure images. In the second stage, we perform multi-granularity fine-tuning using datasets with richer supervisory signals, systematically exploring how auxiliary tasks-specifically chemical bond classification and atom localization-contribute to molecular formula recognition. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning for post-training optimization and introduce a novel stereochemical structure dataset. Remarkably, we find that even with MolSight's relatively compact parameter size, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm can further enhance the model's performance on stereomolecular. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, our results demonstrate that MolSight achieves state-of-the-art performance in (stereo)chemical optical structure recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extending Test-Time Scaling: A 3D Perspective with Context, Batch, and Turn](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15738v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning reinforcement learning (RL) has recently revealed a new scaling effect: test-time scaling. Thinking models such as R1 and o1 improve their reasoning accuracy at test time as the length of the reasoning context increases. However, compared with training-time scaling, test-time scaling is fundamentally limited by the limited context length of base models, which remains orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of tokens consumed during training. We revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality. Building on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling. We show that: (1) each dimension demonstrates a test-time scaling effect, but with a bounded capacity; (2) combining all three dimensions substantially improves the reasoning performance of challenging testbeds, including IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and further benefits from human preference feedback; and (3) the human-in-the-loop framework naturally extends to a more open-ended domain, i.e., embodied learning, which enables the design of humanoid control behaviors.</p></details> | 44 pages, 12 figures |

This study presents a Multi-Layered Auditing Platform for Responsible AI that systematically evaluates cross-cultural value alignment in China-origin and Western-origin LLMs through four integrated methodologies: Ethical Dilemma Corpus for assessing temporal stability, Diversity-Enhanced Framework (DEF) for quantifying cultural fidelity, First-Token Probability Alignment for distributional accuracy, and Multi-stAge Reasoning frameworK (MARK) for interpretable decision-making. Our comparative analysis of 20+ leading models, such as Qwen, GPT-4o, Claude, LLaMA, and DeepSeek, reveals universal challenges-fundamental instability in value systems, systematic under-representation of younger demographics, and non-linear relationships between model scale and alignment quality-alongside divergent regional development trajectories.

Large-scale molecular screening has been applied to the search for alternatives, but in practice only about 300 refrigerants are known, and only a few additional candidates have been suggested without experimental validation. This scarcity of reliable data limits the effectiveness of purely data-driven methods. We present Refgen, a generative pipeline that integrates machine learning with physics-grounded inductive biases. Alongside fine-tuning for valid molecular generation, Refgen incorporates predictive models for critical properties, equations of state, thermochemical polynomials, and full vapor compression cycle simulations. These models enable reinforcement learning fine-tuning under thermodynamic constraints, enforcing consistency and guiding discovery toward molecules that balance efficiency, safety, and environmental impact. By embedding physics into the learning process, Refgen leverages scarce data effectively and enables de novo refrigerant discovery beyond the known set of compounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 1st SIMBIOCHEM Workshop at EurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, standard deep learning suffers from a fundamental issue: loss of plasticity, in which networks gradually lose their ability to learn from new data. Here we show that quantum learning models naturally overcome this limitation, preserving plasticity over long timescales. We demonstrate this advantage systematically across a broad spectrum of tasks from multiple learning paradigms, including supervised learning and reinforcement learning, and diverse data modalities, from classical high-dimensional images to quantum-native datasets. Although classical models exhibit performance degradation correlated with unbounded weight and gradient growth, quantum neural networks maintain consistent learning capabilities regardless of the data or task. We identify the origin of the advantage as the intrinsic physical constraints of quantum models. Unlike classical networks where unbounded weight growth leads to landscape ruggedness or saturation, the unitary constraints confine the optimization to a compact manifold. Our results suggest that the utility of quantum computing in machine learning extends beyond potential speedups, offering a robust pathway for building adaptive artificial intelligence and lifelong learners.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures and supplementary information</p></details> |
| **[LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04652v4)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMLRL/CoMLRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrap Off-policy with World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00423v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online planning has proven effective in reinforcement learning (RL) for improving sample efficiency and final performance. However, using planning for environment interaction inevitably introduces a divergence between the collected data and the policy's actual behaviors, degrading both model learning and policy improvement. To address this, we propose BOOM (Bootstrap Off-policy with WOrld Model), a framework that tightly integrates planning and off-policy learning through a bootstrap loop: the policy initializes the planner, and the planner refines actions to bootstrap the policy through behavior alignment. This loop is supported by a jointly learned world model, which enables the planner to simulate future trajectories and provides value targets to facilitate policy improvement. The core of BOOM is a likelihood-free alignment loss that bootstraps the policy using the planner's non-parametric action distribution, combined with a soft value-weighted mechanism that prioritizes high-return behaviors and mitigates variability in the planner's action quality within the replay buffer. Experiments on the high-dimensional DeepMind Control Suite and Humanoid-Bench show that BOOM achieves state-of-the-art results in both training stability and final performance.

| **[LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396v4)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods lack the causal reasoning and multimodal understanding required for reliable generalization. We introduce $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$, a large-scale dataset and benchmark that couples Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined risk rasters across the USA, and real wildfire events in Europe for cross-continental evaluation. Building on this dataset, we propose $\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces. When trained in the USA and tested in Europe, $\textbf{FireScope}$ achieves substantial performance gains, while expert feedback and automated analysis confirm that its reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to (1) demonstrate that language-based reasoning can improve generalization in visual generation, (2) propose a high-resolution wildfire risk model that can be applied across continents, and (3) enable systematic studies of robust cross-continental generalization for multimodal fire risk models. We believe that $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$ has the potential to serve as a foundation for advancing reasoning-driven, interpretable and generalizable spatial modeling. Data and source code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIR: Efficient Exploration in Episodic Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Mutual Intrinsic Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17165v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Episodic rewards present a significant challenge in reinforcement learning. While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards. Our evalu-ation compares the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches in the MiniGrid-MA setting, with experimental results demonstrating superior perfor-mance.</p></details> |  |
| **[How LLMs Learn to Reason: A Complex Network Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23629v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, a V-shaped response-length trajectory, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these behaviors are emergent collective phenomena governed not by neural implementation details, but by the topological evolution of the latent reasoning graph in semantic space. By demonstrating a dynamical isomorphism between a 1.5B-parameter LLM and a minimal Concept Network Model (CoNet), we trace the causal source to the self-organization of a sparse concept web pinned to an average degree of two. This geometric perspective provides a unified physical explanation for the observed anomalies: the V-shaped trajectory tracks the evolution from parallel local skill optimization to global network integration; catastrophic forgetting stems from the topological disconnection of critical ``trunk'' edges; and policy collapse arises from the accumulation of sequential transitions at the web's leaf nodes, where broad exploration abruptly freezes into rigid, high-reward trajectories. Identifying a ``maximally frustrated state'' at the transition between learning stages, we propose Annealed-RLVR, a principled algorithm that injects a targeted SFT ``heating'' step to resolve this topological bottleneck. Experiments confirm that this theory-driven intervention outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks (including Minerva and AIME). By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, 1 table, under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Dissecting Quantum Reinforcement Learning: A Systematic Evaluation of Key Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17112v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameterised quantum circuit (PQC) based Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm at the intersection of quantum computing and reinforcement learning (RL). By design, PQCs create hybrid quantum-classical models, but their practical applicability remains uncertain due to training instabilities, barren plateaus (BPs), and the difficulty of isolating the contribution of individual pipeline components. In this work, we dissect PQC based QRL architectures through a systematic experimental evaluation of three aspects recurrently identified as critical: (i) data embedding strategies, with Data Reuploading (DR) as an advanced approach; (ii) ansatz design, particularly the role of entanglement; and (iii) post-processing blocks after quantum measurement, with a focus on the underexplored Output Reuse (OR) technique. Using a unified PPO-CartPole framework, we perform controlled comparisons between hybrid and classical agents under identical conditions. Our results show that OR, though purely classical, exhibits distinct behaviour in hybrid pipelines, that DR improves trainability and stability, and that stronger entanglement can degrade optimisation, offsetting classical gains. Together, these findings provide controlled empirical evidence of the interplay between quantum and classical contributions, and establish a reproducible framework for systematic benchmarking and component-wise analysis in QRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Progress-Think: Semantic Progress Reasoning for Vision-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17097v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation requires agents to act coherently over long horizons by understanding not only local visual context but also how far they have advanced within a multi-step instruction. However, recent Vision-Language-Action models focus on direct action prediction and earlier progress methods predict numeric achievements; both overlook the monotonic co-progression property of the observation and instruction sequences. Building on this insight, Progress-Think introduces semantic progress reasoning, predicting instruction-style progress from visual observations to enable more accurate navigation. To achieve this without expensive annotations, we propose a three-stage framework. In the initial stage, Self-Aligned Progress Pretraining bootstraps a reasoning module via a novel differentiable alignment between visual history and instruction prefixes. Then, Progress-Guided Policy Pretraining injects learned progress states into the navigation context, guiding the policy toward consistent actions. Finally, Progress-Policy Co-Finetuning jointly optimizes both modules with tailored progress-aware reinforcement objectives. Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show state-of-the-art success and efficiency, demonstrating that semantic progress yields a more consistent representation of navigation advancement.</p></details> |  |

Routing protocols that were made for land-based networks, like RPL, don't work well in these underwater settings. This paper talks about RL-RPL-UA, a new routing protocol that uses reinforcement learning to make things work better in underwater situations. Each node has a small RL agent that picks the best parent node depending on local data such the link quality, buffer level, packet delivery ratio, and remaining energy. RL-RPL-UA works with all standard RPL messages and adds a dynamic objective function to help people make decisions in real time. Aqua-Sim simulations demonstrate that RL-RPL-UA boosts packet delivery by up to 9.2%, uses 14.8% less energy per packet, and adds 80 seconds to the network's lifetime compared to previous approaches. These results show that RL-RPL-UA is a potential and energy-efficient way to route data in underwater networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, 10 Figures, 2 Tables</p></details> |

We propose RL-AD-Net, a reinforcement learning (RL) refinement framework that operates in the latent space of a pretrained point autoencoder. The autoencoder encodes completions into compact global feature vectors (GFVs), which are selectively adjusted by an RL agent to improve geometric fidelity. To ensure robustness, a lightweight non-parametric PointNN selector evaluates the geometric consistency of both the original completion and the RL-refined output, retaining the better reconstruction. When ground truth is available, both Chamfer Distance and geometric consistency metrics guide refinement. Training is performed separately per category, since the unsupervised and dynamic nature of RL makes convergence across highly diverse categories challenging. Nevertheless, the framework can be extended to multi-category refinement in future work. Experiments on ShapeNetCore-2048 demonstrate that while baseline completion networks perform reasonable under their training-style cropping, they struggle in random cropping scenarios. In contrast, RL-AD-Net consistently delivers improvements across both settings, highlighting the effectiveness of RL-guided ensemble refinement. The approach is lightweight, modular, and model-agnostic, making it applicable to a wide range of completion networks without requiring retraining.</p></details> |  |

We then benchmark existing MORL algorithms on this task. Our results show that specialized water management methods outperform state-of-the-art MORL approaches, underscoring the scalability challenges MORL algorithms face in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAMAS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models with Intrinsic Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00794v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning ability of large language models, yet training remains costly because many rollouts contribute little to optimization, considering the amount of computation required. This study investigates how simply leveraging intrinsic data properties, almost free benefit during training, can improve data efficiency for RLVR. We propose PREPO with two complementary components. First, we adopt prompt perplexity as an indicator of model adaptability in learning, enabling the model to progress from well-understood contexts to more challenging ones. Second, we amplify the discrepancy among the rollouts by differentiating their relative entropy, and prioritize sequences that exhibit a higher degree of exploration. Together, these mechanisms reduce rollout demand while preserving competitive performance. On the Qwen and Llama models, PREPO achieves effective results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with up to 3 times fewer rollouts than the baselines. Beyond empirical gains, we provide theoretical and in-depth analyses explaining the underlying rationale of our method to improve the data efficiency of RLVR.</p></details> |  |
| **[KRAL: Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning for LLM-assisted Clinical Antimicrobial Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15974v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles,host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials,and the severity of infection. This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at about 20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods manually design instructions for the LLM to generate adversarial prompts, which effectively bypass safety filters while producing sensitive images, exposing safety vulnerabilities of T2I models. However, due to the LLM's limited understanding of the T2I model and its safety filters, existing methods require numerous queries to achieve a successful attack, limiting their practical applicability. To address this issue, we propose Reason2Attack(R2A), which aims to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities in generating adversarial prompts by incorporating the jailbreaking attack into the post-training process of the LLM. Specifically, we first propose a CoT example synthesis pipeline based on Frame Semantics, which generates adversarial prompts by identifying related terms and corresponding context illustrations. Using CoT examples generated by the pipeline, we fine-tune the LLM to understand the reasoning path and format the output structure. Subsequently, we incorporate the jailbreaking attack task into the reinforcement learning process of the LLM and design an attack process reward that considers prompt length, prompt stealthiness, and prompt effectiveness, aiming to further enhance reasoning accuracy. Extensive experiments on various T2I models show that R2A achieves a better attack success ratio while requiring fewer queries than baselines. Moreover, our adversarial prompts demonstrate strong attack transferability across both open-source and commercial T2I models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Noted...</summary><p>Noted that This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive or distressing material</p></details> |

Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[CroTad: A Contrastive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Online Trajectory Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16929v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting trajectory anomalies is a vital task in modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling the identification of unsafe, inefficient, or irregular travel behaviours. While deep learning has emerged as the dominant approach, several key challenges remain unresolved. First, sub-trajectory anomaly detection, capable of pinpointing the precise segments where anomalies occur, remains underexplored compared to whole-trajectory analysis. Second, many existing methods depend on carefully tuned thresholds, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications. Moreover, the irregular sampling of trajectory data and the presence of noise in training sets further degrade model performance, making it difficult to learn reliable representations of normal routes. To address these challenges, we propose a contrastive reinforcement learning framework for online trajectory anomaly detection, CroTad. Our method is threshold-free and robust to noisy, irregularly sampled data. By incorporating contrastive learning, CroTad learns to extract diverse normal travel patterns for different itineraries and effectively distinguish anomalous behaviours at both sub-trajectory and point levels. The detection module leverages deep reinforcement learning to perform online, real-time anomaly scoring, enabling timely and fine-grained identification of abnormal segments. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework across various evaluation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, will be submitted to VLDBJ</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Differential Reward: Combining Temporal Difference and Action Gradients for Efficient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Cooperative Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16916v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-vehicle cooperative driving tasks involving high-frequency continuous control, traditional state-based reward functions suffer from the issue of vanishing reward differences. This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[PepEVOLVE: Position-Aware Dynamic Peptide Optimization via Group-Relative Advantage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16912v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Macrocyclic peptides are an emerging modality that combines biologics-like affinity with small-molecule-like developability, but their vast combinatorial space and multi-parameter objectives make lead optimization slow and challenging. Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints. Overall, PepEVOLVE offers a practical, reproducible path to peptide lead optimization when optimal edit sites are unknown, enabling more efficient exploration and improving design quality across multiple objectives.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we define a concept of talent breakout and propose a method to detect Japanese talents before their rise to stardom. The main focus of the study is to determine the effectiveness of combining Twitter and TV data on predicting time-dependent changes in social data. Although traditional time-series models are known to be robust in many applications, the success of neural network models in various fields (e.g.\ Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning) continues to spark an interest in the time-series community to apply new techniques in practice. Therefore, in order to find the best modeling approach, we have experimented with traditional, neural network and ensemble learning methods. We observe that ensemble learning methods outperform traditional and neural network models based on standard regression metrics. However, by utilizing the concept of talent breakout, we are able to assess the true forecasting ability of the models, where neural networks outperform traditional and ensemble learning methods in terms of precision and recall.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages.

However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026.

Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from 81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>20th ...</summary><p>20th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation & Personalization</p></details> |
| **[Improving Latent Reasoning in LLMs via Soft Concept Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16885v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike human reasoning in abstract conceptual spaces, large language models (LLMs) typically reason by generating discrete tokens, which potentially limit their expressive power. The recent work Soft Thinking has shown that LLMs' latent reasoning via soft concepts is a promising direction, but LLMs are trained on discrete tokens. To reduce this gap between the soft concepts in reasoning and the discrete tokens in training, we propose Soft Concept Mixing (SCM), a soft concept aware training scheme that directly exposes the model to soft representations during training. Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings. Then, this vector is mixed into the model's hidden states, which embody rich contextual information. Finally, the entire latent reasoning process is optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SCM improves the reasoning performance of LLMs, and simultaneously maintains a stable training dynamic.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, the vast complexity of outdoor aerial environments compounds data acquisition challenges and imposes long-horizon trajectory planning requirements on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), introducing novel complexities for aerial VLN. To address these challenges, we propose a data-efficient Open-world aerial Vision-Language Navigation (i.e., OpenVLN) framework, which could execute language-guided flight with limited data constraints and enhance long-horizon trajectory planning capabilities in complex aerial environments. Specifically, we reconfigure a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the VLM for UAV navigation tasks, which can efficiently fine-tune VLM by using rule-based policies under limited training data. Concurrently, we introduce a long-horizon planner for trajectory synthesis that dynamically generates precise UAV actions via value-based rewards. To the end, we conduct sufficient navigation experiments on the TravelUAV benchmark with dataset scaling across diverse reward settings. Our method demonstrates consistent performance gains of up to 4.34% in Success Rate, 6.19% in Oracle Success Rate, and 4.07% in Success weighted by Path Length over baseline methods, validating its deployment efficacy for long-horizon UAV navigation in complex aerial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Conte...</summary><p>Content: 8 pages 4 figures, conference paper under review</p></details> |
| **[RPRO: Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization for Enhancing Medical QA and Diagnostic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00974v4)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a novel framework that combines reinforcement learning with preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought (CoT) performance. RPRO distinguishes itself from prior approaches by employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation mechanism that aligns model outputs with established clinical workflows, while automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking optimization based on the Bradley--Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA, MedQA-USMLE, and a real-world clinical dataset from Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (FEMH) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 2B-parameter model outperforms much larger 7B--20B models, including medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining preference optimization with quality-driven refinement provides a scalable and clinically grounded approach to building more reliable medical LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While recent methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce $\textbf{AVATAR}$ ($\textbf{A}$udio-$\textbf{V}$ideo $\textbf{A}$gen$\textbf{t}$ for $\textbf{A}$lignment and $\textbf{R}$easoning), a framework that addresses these limitations through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping (TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases during learning. $\textbf{AVATAR}$ achieves strong performance across various benchmarks, outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by $\mathbf{+5.4}$ on MMVU, $\mathbf{+4.9}$ on OmniBench, and $\mathbf{+4.5}$ on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating $\textbf{$5$$\times$ sample efficiency}$, requiring $80\%$ fewer generated completions to reach target performance.</p></details> |  |

Our system encodes inputs through a grid-cell-like layer, followed by sparse pattern separation using a dentate gyrus-inspired module with top-k sparsity. Episodic memory traces are maintained in a CA3-like autoassociative memory. Task-specific processing is dynamically managed via a DG-gated mixture-of-experts mechanism, wherein inputs are routed to experts based on cosine similarity between their normalized sparse DG representations and learned task-specific DG prototypes computed through online exponential moving averages. This biologically grounded yet mathematically principled gating strategy enables differentiable, scalable task-routing without relying on a separate gating network, and enhances the model's adaptability and efficiency in learning multiple sequential tasks. Cortical outputs are consolidated using Elastic Weight Consolidation weighted by inter-task similarity. Crucially, we incorporate prioritized replay of stored patterns to reinforce essential past experiences. Evaluations on standard continual learning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture in reducing task interference, achieving near state-of-the-art results in continual learning tasks at lower computational costs.

They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation.

Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization.

However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

| **[Taming the Long-Tail: Efficient Reasoning RL Training with Adaptive Drafter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16665v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities marks a significant milestone, unlocking new frontiers in complex problem-solving. However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment.

| **[Dexterity from Smart Lenses: Multi-Fingered Robot Manipulation with In-the-Wild Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16661v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning multi-fingered robot policies from humans performing daily tasks in natural environments has long been a grand goal in the robotics community. Achieving this would mark significant progress toward generalizable robot manipulation in human environments, as it would reduce the reliance on labor-intensive robot data collection. Despite substantial efforts, progress toward this goal has been bottle-necked by the embodiment gap between humans and robots, as well as by difficulties in extracting relevant contextual and motion cues that enable learning of autonomous policies from in-the-wild human videos. We claim that with simple yet sufficiently powerful hardware for obtaining human data and our proposed framework AINA, we are now one significant step closer to achieving this dream. AINA enables learning multi-fingered policies from data collected by anyone, anywhere, and in any environment using Aria Gen 2 glasses. These glasses are lightweight and portable, feature a high-resolution RGB camera, provide accurate on-board 3D head and hand poses, and offer a wide stereo view that can be leveraged for depth estimation of the scene. This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation). We compare our framework against prior human-to-robot policy learning approaches, ablate our design choices, and demonstrate results across nine everyday manipulation tasks. Robot rollouts are best viewed on our website: https://aina-robot.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stabilizing Policy Gradient Methods via Reward Profiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16629v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy gradient methods, which have been extensively studied in the last decade, offer an effective and efficient framework for reinforcement learning problems. However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

For a particular signal decay, the process for ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed analysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic overlaps, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the simulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process typically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic method exists. This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective, we present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to overcome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the critical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty hadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is broadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from a Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits the synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with highly sparse rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs to efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful trajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training. Our method also incorporates a transformer architecture for the RL agent to handle token sequences representing decays.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures |

To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Green Resilience of Cyber-Physical Systems: Doctoral Dissertation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16593v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical components. Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.</p></details> |  |

Multiple attack and defense agent personas were crafted, reflecting heterogeneity in agent actions, to generate LLM-guided reward designs where the LLM was first provided with contextual cyber simulation environment information. These reward structures were then utilized within a DRL-driven attack-defense simulation environment to learn an ensemble of cyber defense policies.

However, these functions often struggle to approximate the Pareto front accurately, rendering them unideal in complex, uncertain environments. This study examines selected Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms across MORL environments with discrete action and observation spaces. We aim to investigate further the limitations associated with scalarisation approaches for decision-making in multi-objective settings. Specifically, we use an outer-loop multi-policy methodology to assess the performance of a seminal single-policy MORL algorithm, MO Q-Learning implemented with linear scalarisation and Chebyshev scalarisation functions. In addition, we explore a pioneering inner-loop multi-policy algorithm, Pareto Q-Learning, which offers a more robust alternative. Our findings reveal that the performance of the scalarisation functions is highly dependent on the environment and the shape of the Pareto front. These functions often fail to retain the solutions uncovered during learning and favour finding solutions in certain regions of the solution space. Moreover, finding the appropriate weight configurations to sample the entire Pareto front is complex, limiting their applicability in uncertain settings. In contrast, inner-loop multi-policy algorithms may provide a more sustainable and generalizable approach and potentially facilitate intelligent decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, published in the Proceedings of the 46th Annual Conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists (SAICSIT 2025)</p></details> |

While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, published in the Proceedings of the 46th Annual conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists (SIACSIT 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Eliciting Reasoning in Language Models with Cognitive Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12115v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advent of reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 was met with excited speculation by the AI community about the mechanisms underlying these capabilities in closed models, followed by a rush of replication efforts, particularly from the open source community. These speculations were largely settled by the demonstration from DeepSeek-R1 that chains-of-thought and reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively replicate reasoning on top of base LLMs. However, it remains valuable to explore alternative methods for theoretically eliciting reasoning that could help elucidate the underlying mechanisms, as well as providing additional methods that may offer complementary benefits. Here, we build on the long-standing literature in cognitive psychology and cognitive architectures, which postulates that reasoning arises from the orchestrated, sequential execution of a set of modular, predetermined cognitive operations. Crucially, we implement this key idea within a modern agentic tool-calling framework. In particular, we endow an LLM with a small set of "cognitive tools" encapsulating specific reasoning operations, each executed by the LLM itself. Surprisingly, this simple strategy results in considerable gains in performance on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to base LLMs, for both closed and open-weight models. For instance, providing our "cognitive tools" to GPT-4.1 increases its pass@1 performance on AIME2024 from 32% to 53%, even surpassing the performance of o1-preview. In addition to its practical implications, this demonstration contributes to the debate regarding the role of post-training methods in eliciting reasoning in LLMs versus the role of inherent capabilities acquired during pre-training, and whether post-training merely uncovers these latent abilities.</p></details> | 25 pages, 2 figures |
| **[LAOF: Robust Latent Action Learning with Optical Flow Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16407v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning latent actions from large-scale videos is crucial for the pre-training of scalable embodied foundation models, yet existing methods often struggle with action-irrelevant distractors. Although incorporating action supervision can alleviate these distractions, its effectiveness is restricted by the scarcity of available action labels. Optical flow represents pixel-level motion between consecutive frames, naturally suppressing background elements and emphasizing moving objects. Motivated by this, we propose robust Latent Action learning with Optical Flow constraints, called LAOF, a pseudo-supervised framework that leverages the agent's optical flow as an action-driven signal to learn latent action representations robust to distractors. Experimental results show that the latent representations learned by LAOF outperform existing methods on downstream imitation learning and reinforcement learning tasks. This superior performance arises from optical flow constraints, which substantially stabilize training and improve the quality of latent representations under extremely label-scarce conditions, while remaining effective as the proportion of action labels increases to 10 percent. Importantly, even without action supervision, LAOF matches or surpasses action-supervised methods trained with 1 percent of action labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code can be found at https://github.com/XizoB/LAOF</p></details> |

Previous solutions have made progress in explicitly modeling the dynamic obstacle motion for avoidance, but this key dependency of decision-making is time-consuming and unreliable in highly dynamic scenarios with occlusions. On the contrary, without introducing object detection, tracking, and prediction, we empower the reinforcement learning (RL) with single LiDAR sensing to realize an autonomous flight system directly from point to motion. For exteroception, a depth sensing distance map achieving fixed-shape, low-resolution, and detail-safe is encoded from raw point clouds, and an environment change sensing point flow is adopted as motion features extracted from multi-frame observations. These two are integrated into a lightweight and easy-to-learn representation of complex dynamic environments. For action generation, the behavior of avoiding dynamic threats in advance is implicitly driven by the proposed change-aware sensing representation, where the policy optimization is indicated by the relative motion modulated distance field. With the deployment-friendly sensing simulation and dynamics model-free acceleration control, the proposed system shows a superior success rate and adaptability to alternatives, and the policy derived from the simulator can drive a real-world quadrotor with safe maneuvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), November, 2025</p></details> |
| **[OpenMMReasoner: Pushing the Frontiers for Multimodal Reasoning with an Open and General Recipe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16334v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Self-Rewriting into Large Language Model Reasoning Reinforcement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16331v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Through reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome correctness rewards, large reasoning models (LRMs) with scaled inference computation have demonstrated substantial success on complex reasoning tasks. However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only "simple" samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Safe and Optimal Variable Impedance Control via Certified Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16330v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful approach for robots to learn complex, collaborative skills by combining Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) for motion and Variable Impedance Control (VIC) for compliant interaction. However, this model-free paradigm often risks instability and unsafe exploration due to the time-varying nature of impedance gains. This work introduces Certified Gaussian Manifold Sampling (C-GMS), a novel trajectory-centric RL framework that learns combined DMP and VIC policies while guaranteeing Lyapunov stability and actuator feasibility by construction. Our approach reframes policy exploration as sampling from a mathematically defined manifold of stable gain schedules. This ensures every policy rollout is guaranteed to be stable and physically realizable, thereby eliminating the need for reward penalties or post-hoc validation. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our approach ensures bounded tracking error even in the presence of bounded model errors and deployment-time uncertainties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of C-GMS in simulation and verify its efficacy on a real robot, paving the way for reliable autonomous interaction in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

The framework comprises three core line-up of models: Kandinsky 5.0 Image Lite - a line-up of 6B parameter image generation models, Kandinsky 5.0 Video Lite - a fast and lightweight 2B parameter text-to-video and image-to-video models, and Kandinsky 5.0 Video Pro - 19B parameter models that achieves superior video generation quality. We provide a comprehensive review of the data curation lifecycle - including collection, processing, filtering and clustering - for the multi-stage training pipeline that involves extensive pre-training and incorporates quality-enhancement techniques such as self-supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. We also present novel architectural, training, and inference optimizations that enable Kandinsky 5.0 to achieve high generation speeds and state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, as demonstrated by human evaluation. As a large-scale, publicly available generative framework, Kandinsky 5.0 leverages the full potential of its pre-training and subsequent stages to be adapted for a wide range of generative applications. We hope that this report, together with the release of our open-source code and training checkpoints, will substantially advance the development and accessibility of high-quality generative models for the research community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://kandinskylab.ai/</p></details> |
| **[Conan: Progressive Learning to Reason Like a Detective over Multi-Scale Visual Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20470v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding, yet still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these limitations, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step video reasoning. Conan identifies context and evidence frames, reasons over cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further. To achieve this, we 1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of automatically generated reasoning traces that include frame identification, evidence reasoning, and action decision, and 2) design a multi-stage progressive cold-start strategy combined with an Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to progressively incentivize multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to long video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisPlay: Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15661v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for improving Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RL approaches often rely on human-annotated labels or task-specific heuristics to define verifiable rewards, both of which are costly and difficult to scale. We introduce VisPlay, a self-evolving RL framework that enables VLMs to autonomously improve their reasoning abilities using large amounts of unlabeled image data. Starting from a single base VLM, VisPlay assigns the model into two interacting roles: an Image-Conditioned Questioner that formulates challenging yet answerable visual questions, and a Multimodal Reasoner that generates silver responses. These roles are jointly trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which incorporates diversity and difficulty rewards to balance the complexity of generated questions with the quality of the silver answers. VisPlay scales efficiently across two model families. When trained on Qwen2.5-VL and MiMo-VL, VisPlay achieves consistent improvements in visual reasoning, compositional generalization, and hallucination reduction across eight benchmarks, including MM-Vet and MMMU, demonstrating a scalable path toward self-evolving multimodal intelligence.

| **[Optimizing Operation Recipes with Reinforcement Learning for Safe and Interpretable Control of Chemical Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16297v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal operation of chemical processes is vital for energy, resource, and cost savings in chemical engineering. The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data. Optimal control methods, such as model predictive control, also struggle with the complexity of the underlying dynamic models. Consequently, many chemical processes rely on manually defined operation recipes combined with simple linear controllers, leading to suboptimal performance and limited flexibility. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages expert knowledge embedded in operation recipes. By using reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of these recipes and their underlying linear controllers, we achieve an optimized operation recipe. This method requires significantly less data, handles constraints more effectively, and is more interpretable than traditional reinforcement learning methods due to the structured nature of the recipes. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through simulation results of an industrial batch polymerization reactor, showing that it can approach the performance of optimal controllers while addressing the limitations of existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, Part of the workshop 'Machine Learning for Chemistry and Chemical Engineering (ML4CCE)' at the ECML24 conference: Link: https://ml4cce-ecml.com/</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Fairness-aware Interactive Recommendation: Item Lifecycle as a Control Knob](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16248v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

To evaluate and enhance this capability, the pass@k metric, which measures the probability of obtaining at least one correct solution in k independent samples, has received significant attention. Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of "exploration collapse", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes. We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization. Instead, mechanisms explicitly encouraging efficient exploration could offer a more effective path forward for reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the open wireless environment, dynamic topology, and resource constraints of UAVs expose low-altitude networks to severe DoS threats. Traditional defense approaches, which rely on fixed configurations or centralized decision-making, cannot effectively respond to the rapidly changing conditions in UAV swarm environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework for proactive DoS mitigation in low-altitude networks. Specifically, we design lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process, capturing the uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV is equipped with a policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions based on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy gradient-based algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their policies via reward-weighted aggregation. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack mitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and decreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%, respectively, under various DoS attack strategies. These results highlight the potential of intelligent, distributed defense mechanisms to protect low-altitude networks, paving the way for reliable and scalable low-altitude economy.</p></details> | <details><summary>15pag...</summary><p>15pages; Accepted by IEEE TCCN</p></details> |
| **[An Image Is Worth Ten Thousand Words: Verbose-Text Induction Attacks on VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16163v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on multimodal tasks, concerns regarding their deployment efficiency have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video2Layout: Recall and Reconstruct Metric-Grounded Cognitive Map for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16160v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

Beyond their capabilities for dynamic transportation, these systems possess the inherent yet unexploited potential to perform manipulation. By merging the fields of transportation and manipulation into a coordinated swarm of magnetic robots (MagBots), we enable manufacturing systems to achieve significantly higher efficiency, adaptability, and compactness. To support the development of intelligent algorithms for magnetic levitation systems, we introduce MagBotSim (Magnetic Robotics Simulation): a physics-based simulation for magnetic levitation systems. By framing magnetic levitation systems as robot swarms and providing a dedicated simulation, this work lays the foundation for next generation manufacturing systems powered by Magnetic Robotics.

It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker. Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAPO: Robust Advantage Estimation for Real-World Code LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21830v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for post-training large language models (LLMs) in code editing, where group-relative methods like GRPO are popular for their critic-free, normalized advantage estimation. However, in real-world code-editing scenarios, reward distributions are often skewed with unpredictable outliers, leading to distorted advantage computation and increased noise. To address this issue, we propose Group Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), which adaptively finds an outlier-free highest-density interval (HDI) per prompt and then uses the median of that interval as an adaptive Q to replace the group mean in advantage calculation. This adaptive Q robustly handles skewed distributions while remaining plug-and-play and efficient. We validate GAPO on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) using a large internal dataset of 51,844 real-world, history-aware code-editing tasks across 10 languages, demonstrating consistent improvements in exact match accuracy over GRPO and its variant DAPO.

It adopts a decoupled architecture that formulates the task as joint referring image segmentation and video mask propagation. It comprises three stages: (1) A hierarchical text-guided frame sampler to emulate human attention; (2) A reasoning model that produces spatial cues along with explicit reasoning chains; and (3) A segmentation-propagation stage using SAM2 and XMem. A task difficulty-aware mechanism adaptively controls reasoning length for better efficiency and accuracy.

The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mathematical Framework for Custom Reward Functions in Job Application Evaluation using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16073v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) tend to be inflexible keyword-matchers, and deny gifted candidates a role due to a few minor semantic mismatches. This article describes a new two-step process to design a more refined resume evaluation model based on a small language model (<600M parameters) that is finetuned using GRPO on a custom reward function. To begin with, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to build a solid baseline model. Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching. We indicate that the RL application presents a critical problem of reward hacking due to the initial experiments of aggressive penalties, which produces faulty, excessively negative model behaviors. We have overcome this challenge by refining the reward function repeatedly and training hyperparameters into a stable "gentle polishing process" of the reward function. Our resulting GRPO-polished model demonstrates significant real-world efficacy, achieving a final accuracy of 91% on unseen test data. The model shows a strong ability to correctly identify qualified candidates (recall of 0.85 for the 'SELECTED' class) while also showing exceptional precision (1.0), confirming its reliability. These results indicate that a properly executed, two-step fine-tuning procedure can indeed effectively refine a small language model to be able to conduct fine-tuned and human-like candidate scoring, overcoming the drawbacks of both traditional ATS and naive RL usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, 2 equations, 3 Tables</p></details> |

This paper introduces a synaptic Q-learning algorithm for the control of the classical Cartpole, where the Bellman equations are incorporated at the synaptic level. This formulation enables the iterative evolution of the network topology, represented as a directed graph, throughout the training process. This is followed by a similar approach called neuromorphic Bellman Memory Units (BMU(s)), which are implemented with the Neural Engineering Framework on Intel's Loihi neuromorphic chip. Topology evolution, in conjunction with mixed-signal computation, leverages the optimization of the number of neurons and synapses that could be used to design spike-based reinforcement learning accelerators. The proposed architecture can potentially reduce resource utilization on board, aiding the manufacturing of compact application-specific neuromorphic ICs. Moreover, the on-chip learning introduced in this work and implemented on a neuromorphic chip can enable adaptation to unseen control scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |

However, existing lightweight MLLMs lack the capability to balance high efficiency and performance at a small scale. To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks with fewer inference tokens. In the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy Optimization (LIPO), a new reinforcement learning method, to train each reasoning model, including mathematical reasoning, chart reasoning, and OCR capability. The LIPO dynamically adjusts the advantages of responses within groups by prioritizing concise yet high-quality responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate responses. In the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors via a novel gradient projection regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them. Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

We begin tackling the scientifically existential challenge of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection by deploying deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware. Our approach partitions large, pre-trained networks onto SynSense Xylo hardware using maximal splitting, a novel greedy algorithm. We validate this pipeline with on-chip power measurements, achieving instrument-scaled inference at 100mW. While our full-scale SNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among SNN baselines, our experiments reveal a more important insight that a smaller un-partitioned model significantly outperforms larger, split models. This finding highlights that hardware co-design is paramount for optimal performance.

Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula. Empirically, Agent0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities, improving the Qwen3-8B-Base model by 18% on mathematical reasoning and 24% on general reasoning benchmarks.

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone.</p></details> |  |

While numerous methods exist, solving such problems with many scenarios remains challenging. Selecting representative scenarios is a practical method for accelerating solutions. However, current approaches typically rely on clustering or Monte Carlo sampling, failing to integrate scenario information deeply and overlooking the significant impact of the scenario order on solving time. To address these issues, we develop HGCN2SP, a novel model with a hierarchical graph designed for 2SP problems, encoding each scenario and modeling their relationships hierarchically. The model is trained in a reinforcement learning paradigm to utilize the feedback of the solver. The policy network is equipped with a hierarchical graph convolutional network for feature encoding and an attention-based decoder for scenario selection in proper order. Evaluation of two classic 2SP problems demonstrates that HGCN2SP provides high-quality decisions in a short computational time. Furthermore, HGCN2SP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities in handling large-scale instances, even with a substantial number of variables or scenarios that were unseen during the training phase.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |

CoT training follows a two-stage paradigm: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). To enhance CoT quality in RL, we propose Confidence-Guided Policy Optimization (CGPO), a lightweight single-sample algorithm that leverages the discrepancy between reward and model confidence as a per-sample advantage signal. This design naturally focuses updates on informative responses while eliminating group sampling, thereby addressing GRPO's key limitations: confidence-agnostic learning, signal dilution, and prohibitive computational overhead. We also introduce an "output-to-reasoning" strategy to construct high-fidelity SFT data that ensures logical consistency with ground-truth masks. Experiments show our model matches or outperforms specialized SOTA methods and strong closed-source VLMs across all tasks, especially achieving an S-measure of 0.899 on CoCA for CoSOD, surpassing the prior best by 8.0 percentage points, despite using far less training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The entire article has undergone significant changes.

However, the inherent randomness and stochastic nature of binary options make price movements highly unpredictable, posing significant challenges for any forecasting approach. This study demonstrates that machine learning algorithms struggle to outperform a simple baseline in predicting binary options movements. Using a dataset of EUR/USD currency pairs from 2021 to 2023, we tested multiple models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), both before and after hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, several neural network architectures, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, were evaluated under different training conditions. Despite these exhaustive efforts, none of the models surpassed the ZeroR baseline accuracy, highlighting the inherent randomness of binary options. These findings reinforce the notion that binary options lack predictable patterns, making them unsuitable for machine learning-based forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 26th International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning (IDEAL 2025)</p></details> |

Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps. Experiments show that our method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each signal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Origi...</summary><p>Originally released June 5, 2025</p></details> |

However, a large body of previous analysis focuses on stochastic approximations driven by contractive operators, which is not applicable in some important reinforcement learning settings like the average reward setting. This work instead investigates stochastic approximations with merely nonexpansive operators. In particular, we study nonexpansive stochastic approximations with Markovian noise, providing both asymptotic and finite sample analysis. Key to our analysis are novel bounds of noise terms resulting from the Poisson equation. As an application, we prove for the first time that classical tabular average reward temporal difference learning converges to a sample-path dependent fixed point.</p></details> |  |

To address the challenge, we present RoboCOIN, a comprehensive multi-embodiment bimanual manipulation dataset with over 180,000 demonstrations collected from 15 distinct robotic platforms. The dataset covers 16 scenarios, including residential, commercial, and working environments, with 421 tasks systematically organized by bimanual coordination patterns and object properties. Our key innovation is a hierarchical capability pyramid that provides multi-level annotations, spanning trajectory-level concepts, segment-level subtasks, and frame-level kinematics. We further develop CoRobot, a comprehensive processing framework featuring Robot Trajectory Markup Language (RTML) for quality assessment, automated annotation generation, and unified multi-embodiment management. Extensive experiments demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of RoboCOIN in multi-embodiment bimanual learning, with significant performance improvements across various model architectures and robotic platforms. The complete dataset and framework are open-sourced and publicly available for further research purposes. Project website: https://FlagOpen.github.io/RoboCOIN/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPEAR-1: Scaling Beyond Robot Demonstrations via 3D Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17411v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic Foundation Models (RFMs) hold great promise as generalist, end-to-end systems for robot control. Yet their ability to generalize across new environments, tasks, and embodiments remains limited. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in their foundations: most RFMs are built by fine-tuning internet-pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities. Following this strategy, we train SPEAR-VLM, a 3D-aware VLM that infers object coordinates in 3D space from a single 2D image. Building on SPEAR-VLM, we introduce our main contribution, $~\textbf{SPEAR-1}$: a robotic foundation model that integrates grounded 3D perception with language-instructed embodied control. Trained on $\sim$45M frames from 24 Open X-Embodiment datasets, SPEAR-1 outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such as $π_0$-FAST and $π_{0.5}$, while it uses 20$\times$ fewer robot demonstrations. This carefully-engineered training strategy unlocks new VLM capabilities and as a consequence boosts the reliability of embodied control beyond what is achievable with only robotic data. We make our model weights and 3D-annotated datasets publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Despite considerable progress in BCI research, most current motion control systems are limited to discrete commands, rather than supporting continuous pursuit, where users can freely adjust speed and direction in real time. Such natural mobility control is, however, essential for wheelchair users to navigate complex public spaces, such as transit stations, airports, hospitals, and indoor corridors, to interact socially with the dynamic populations with agility, and to move flexibly and comfortably as autonomous driving is refined to allow movement at will. In this study, we address the gap of continuous pursuit motion control in BCIs by proposing and validating a brain-inspired Bayesian inference framework, where embodied dynamics in acceleration-based motor representations are decoded. This approach contrasts with conventional kinematics-level decoding and deep learning-based methods. Using a public dataset with sixteen hours of EEG from four subjects performing motor imagery-based target-following, we demonstrate that our method, utilizing Automatic Relevance Determination for feature selection and continual online learning, reduces the normalized mean squared error between predicted and true velocities by 72% compared to autoregressive and EEGNet-based methods in a session-accumulative transfer learning setting. Theoretically, these findings empirically support embodied cognition theory and reveal the brain's intrinsic motor control dynamics in an embodied and predictive nature. Practically, grounding EEG decoding in the same dynamical principles that govern biological motion offers a promising path toward more stable and intuitive BCI control.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 9 figures, and 7 tables</p></details> |

We expand this approach to arbitrary numbers of objectives and compare its performance to scalar weighted sum methods during competitive motion planning. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) software is used to aid in the analysis of high dimensional decision-making data. State-space Exploration of Multidimensional Boundaries using Adherence Strategies (SEMBAS) is applied to explore performance modes in the parameter space as a sensitivity study for the baseline and proposed frameworks. While some works have explored aspects of game theoretic planning and intelligent systems validation separately, we combine each of these into a novel and comprehensive simulation pipeline. This integration demonstrates a dramatic improvement of the vector cost method over scalarization and offers an interpretable and generalizable framework for robotic behavioral planning.

A timely and motivating engineering application is how autonomous vehicles interpret ambiguous right-of-way such as unsignalized pedestrian crossings. To address this challenge, this study explores the feasibility of decoding preparatory neural activity from wearable electroencephalography (EEG) to predict human motion intention before it is behaviorally expressed. Drawing inspiration from biological predictive coding mechanisms between the sensorimotor cortex and insula-frontoparietal network, we implement this principle in a Temporal Convolutional Network-Transformer architecture to decode fast-evolving EEG signals underlying perception-action transitions. In experiments involving twelve participants simulating road-crossing decisions under varying traffic volume, marked crosswalks, and traffic signals, neurophysiological analyses reveal hemispheric asymmetries in functional specialization and identify high-beta oscillations (16-25 Hz) in the right fronto-central region (F4) as robust neural markers of motor readiness and decision commitment. Using sliding-window feature extraction, we benchmarked sixteen classification models across traditional, recurrent, and convolutional deep learning architectures, and found that our approach achieved the highest Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.727 with an approximate 1-second look-ahead. This work demonstrates how biologically grounded temporal architectures can enhance anticipatory intelligence in autonomous systems and represents the first step toward proactive and adaptive human-robot interaction in the built environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This paper focuses on human-robot interaction (HRI) based on human-robot dialogue that relies on the robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding. The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information. This paper proposes a long-context Q-former incorporating left and right context dependency in full videos. Furthermore, this paper proposes a text-conditioning approach to feed text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate the high abstraction of the information in text by Q-former. Experiments with the YouCook2 corpus show that the accuracy of confirmation generation is a major factor in the performance of action planning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-context Q-former improves the confirmation and action planning by integrating VideoLLaMA3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASRU 2025</p></details> |

Typically, existing methods embed 3D positions into visual representations to enhance the spatial precision of actions. However, these methods struggle to achieve temporally coherent control over action execution. In this work, we propose VLA-4D, a general VLA model with 4D awareness for spatiotemporally coherent robotic manipulation. Our model is guided by two key designs: 1) 4D-aware visual representation. We extract visual features, embed 1D time into 3D positions for 4D embeddings, and fuse them into a unified visual representation via a cross-attention mechanism. 2) Spatiotemporal action representation. We extend conventional spatial action representations with temporal information to enable the spatiotemporal planning, and align the multimodal representations into the LLM for spatiotemporal action prediction. Within this unified framework, the designed visual and action representations jointly make robotic manipulation spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent. In addition, we extend the VLA dataset with temporal action annotations for fine-tuning our model. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the superiority of our method across different tasks of robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |

These methods are diverse, ranging from numerical optimization to black-box optimization. While numerical optimization is fast, it is not suitable for cases involving complex structures or discrete values, leading to frequent use of black-box optimization instead. However, black-box optimization suffers from low sampling efficiency and takes considerable sampling iterations to obtain good solutions. In this study, we propose a method to enhance the efficiency of robot body design based on black-box optimization by utilizing large language models (LLMs). In parallel with the sampling process based on black-box optimization, sampling is performed using LLMs, which are provided with problem settings and extensive feedback. We demonstrate that this method enables more efficient exploration of design solutions and discuss its characteristics and limitations.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches treat observation and action generation in a monolithic and goal-agnostic manner, often leading to semantically misaligned predictions and incoherent behaviors. To this end, we propose H-GAR, a Hierarchical interaction framework via Goal-driven observation-Action Refinement.To anchor prediction to the task objective, H-GAR first produces a goal observation and a coarse action sketch that outline a high-level route toward the goal. To enable explicit interaction between observation and action under the guidance of the goal observation for more coherent decision-making, we devise two synergistic modules. (1) Goal-Conditioned Observation Synthesizer (GOS) synthesizes intermediate observations based on the coarse-grained actions and the predicted goal observation. (2) Interaction-Aware Action Refiner (IAAR) refines coarse actions into fine-grained, goal-consistent actions by leveraging feedback from the intermediate observations and a Historical Action Memory Bank that encodes prior actions to ensure temporal consistency. By integrating goal grounding with explicit action-observation interaction in a coarse-to-fine manner, H-GAR enables more accurate manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that H-GAR achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Oral), Project Page: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/H-GAR</p></details> |
| **[A segment anchoring-based balancing algorithm for agricultural multi-robot task allocation with energy constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17076v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot systems have emerged as a key technology for addressing the efficiency and cost challenges in labor-intensive industries. In the representative scenario of smart farming, planning efficient harvesting schedules for a fleet of electric robots presents a highly challenging frontier problem. The complexity arises not only from the need to find Pareto-optimal solutions for the conflicting objectives of makespan and transportation cost, but also from the necessity to simultaneously manage payload constraints and finite battery capacity. When robot loads are dynamically updated during planned multi-trip operations, a mandatory recharge triggered by energy constraints introduces an unscheduled load reset. This interaction creates a complex cascading effect that disrupts the entire schedule and renders traditional optimization methods ineffective. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the segment anchoring-based balancing algorithm (SABA). The core of SABA lies in the organic combination of two synergistic mechanisms: the sequential anchoring and balancing mechanism, which leverages charging decisions as `anchors' to systematically reconstruct disrupted routes, while the proportional splitting-based rebalancing mechanism is responsible for the fine-grained balancing and tuning of the final solutions' makespans. Extensive comparative experiments, conducted on a real-world case study and a suite of benchmark instances, demonstrate that SABA comprehensively outperforms 6 state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both solution convergence and diversity. This research provides a novel theoretical perspective and an effective solution for the multi-robot task allocation problem under energy constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stable Offline Hand-Eye Calibration for any Robot with Just One Mark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17001v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning has achieved remarkable success in a variety of robotic tasks by learning a mapping function from camera-space observations to robot-space actions. Recent work indicates that the use of robot-to-camera transformation information ({\ie}, camera extrinsics) benefits the learning process and produces better results. However, camera extrinsics are oftentimes unavailable and estimation methods usually suffer from local minima and poor generalizations. In this paper, we present CalibAll, a simple yet effective method that \textbf{requires only a single mark} and performs training-free, stable, and accurate camera extrinsic estimation across diverse robots and datasets through a coarse-to-fine calibration pipeline. In particular, we annotate a single mark on an end-effector (EEF), and leverage the correspondence ability emerged from vision foundation models (VFM) to automatically localize the corresponding mark across robots in diverse datasets. Using this mark, together with point tracking and the 3D EEF trajectory, we obtain a coarse camera extrinsic via temporal Perspective-n-Point (PnP). This estimate is further refined through a rendering-based optimization that aligns rendered and ground-true masks, yielding accurate and stable camera extrinsic. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, showing strong robustness and general effectiveness across three robot platforms. It also produces useful auxiliary annotations such as depth maps, link-wise masks, and end-effector 2D trajectories, which can further support downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we present MobileOcc, a semantic occupancy dataset for mobile robots operating in crowded human environments. Our dataset is built using an annotation pipeline that incorporates static object occupancy annotations and a novel mesh optimization framework explicitly designed for human occupancy modeling. It reconstructs deformable human geometry from 2D images and subsequently refines and optimizes it using associated LiDAR point data. Using MobileOcc, we establish benchmarks for two tasks, i) Occupancy prediction and ii) Pedestrian velocity prediction, using different methods including monocular, stereo, and panoptic occupancy, with metrics and baseline implementations for reproducible comparison. Beyond occupancy prediction, we further assess our annotation method on 3D human pose estimation datasets. Results demonstrate that our method exhibits robust performance across different datasets.</p></details> |  |

A significant bottleneck impeding this progress is the critical lack of "in-the-wild" datasets that capture the full complexities of real farmland, including non-rigid motion from wind, drastic illumination variance, and morphological changes resulting from growth. This data gap fundamentally limits research on robust AI models for autonomous field navigation and scene-level dynamic 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we present AgriChrono, a modular robotic data collection platform and multi-modal dataset designed to capture these dynamic farmland conditions. Our platform integrates multiple sensors, enabling remote, time-synchronized acquisition of RGB, Depth, LiDAR, IMU, and Pose data for efficient and repeatable long-term data collection in real-world agricultural environments. We successfully collected 18TB of data over one month, documenting the entire growth cycle of Canola under diverse illumination conditions. We benchmark state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods on AgriChrono, revealing the profound challenge of reconstructing high-fidelity, dynamic non-rigid scenes in such farmland settings. This benchmark validates AgriChrono as a critical asset for advancing model generalization, and its public release is expected to significantly accelerate research and development in precision agriculture.

Achieving this would mark significant progress toward generalizable robot manipulation in human environments, as it would reduce the reliance on labor-intensive robot data collection. Despite substantial efforts, progress toward this goal has been bottle-necked by the embodiment gap between humans and robots, as well as by difficulties in extracting relevant contextual and motion cues that enable learning of autonomous policies from in-the-wild human videos. We claim that with simple yet sufficiently powerful hardware for obtaining human data and our proposed framework AINA, we are now one significant step closer to achieving this dream. AINA enables learning multi-fingered policies from data collected by anyone, anywhere, and in any environment using Aria Gen 2 glasses. These glasses are lightweight and portable, feature a high-resolution RGB camera, provide accurate on-board 3D head and hand poses, and offer a wide stereo view that can be leveraged for depth estimation of the scene. This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation). We compare our framework against prior human-to-robot policy learning approaches, ablate our design choices, and demonstrate results across nine everyday manipulation tasks.

This paper proposes a novel homogeneous Proportional-Integral-Derivative (hPID) control strategy tailored for MRMs to achieve robust and coordinated motion control. Unlike classical PID controllers, the hPID controller leverages the mathematical framework of homogeneous control theory to systematically enhance the stability and convergence properties of the closed-loop system, even in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances involved into a system in a homogeneous way. A homogeneous PID structure is designed, ensuring improved convergence of tracking errors through a graded homogeneity approach that generalizes traditional PID gains to nonlinear, state-dependent functions. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov-based methods, demonstrating that the hPID controller guarantees global asymptotic stability and finite-time convergence under mild assumptions. Experimental results on a representative MRM model validate the effectiveness of the hPID controller in achieving high-precision trajectory tracking for both the mobile base and manipulator arm, outperforming conventional linear PID controllers in terms of response time, steady-state error, and robustness to model uncertainties. This research contributes a scalable and analytically grounded control framework for enhancing the autonomy and reliability of next-generation mobile manipulation systems in structured and unstructured environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Metacognition: Decision Making with Confidence for Tool Invention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16390v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots today often miss a key ingredient of truly intelligent behavior: the ability to reflect on their own cognitive processes and decisions. In humans, this self-monitoring or metacognition is crucial for learning, decision making and problem solving. For instance, they can evaluate how confident they are in performing a task, thus regulating their own behavior and allocating proper resources. Taking inspiration from neuroscience, we propose a robot metacognition architecture centered on confidence (a second-order judgment on decisions) and we demonstrate it on the use case of autonomous tool invention. We propose the use of confidence as a metacognitive measure within the robot decision making scheme. Confidence-informed robots can evaluate the reliability of their decisions, improving their robustness during real-world physical deployment. This form of robotic metacognition emphasizes embodied action monitoring as a means to achieve better informed decisions. We also highlight potential applications and research directions for robot metacognition.</p></details> | under review |
| **[ORV: 4D Occupancy-centric Robot Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03079v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent embodied intelligence suffers from data scarcity, while conventional simulators lack visual realism. Controllable video generation is emerging as a promising data engine, yet current action-conditioned methods still fall short: generated videos are limited in fidelity and temporal consistency, poorly aligned with controls, and often constrained to singleview settings. We attribute these issues to the representational gap between sparse control inputs and dense pixel outputs. Thus, we introduce ORV, a 4D occupancy-centric framework for robot video generation that couples action priors with occupancy-derived visual priors. Concretely, we align chunked 7-DoF actions with video latents via an Action-Expert AdaLN modulation, and inject 2D renderings of 4D semantic occupancy into the generation process as soft guidance. Meanwhile, a central obstacle is the lack of occupancy data for embodied scenarios; we therefore curate ORV-Data, a large-scale, high-quality 4D semantic occupancy dataset of robot manipulation. Across BridgeV2, DROID, and RT-1, ORV improves video generation quality and controllability, achieving 18.8% lower FVD than state of the art, +3.5% success rate on visual planning, and +6.4% success rate on policy learning. Beyond singleview generation, ORV natively supports multiview consistent synthesis and enables simulation-to-real transfer despite significant domain gaps.

| **[InEKFormer: A Hybrid State Estimator for Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16306v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots have great potential for a wide range of applications, including industrial and domestic use, healthcare, and search and rescue missions. However, bipedal locomotion in different environments is still a challenge when it comes to performing stable and dynamic movements. This is where state estimation plays a crucial role, providing fast and accurate feedback of the robot's floating base state to the motion controller. Although classical state estimation methods such as Kalman filters are widely used in robotics, they require expert knowledge to fine-tune the noise parameters. Due to recent advances in the field of machine learning, deep learning methods are increasingly used for state estimation tasks. In this work, we propose the InEKFormer, a novel hybrid state estimation method that incorporates an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) and a Transformer network. We compare our method with the InEKF and the KalmanNet approaches on datasets obtained from the humanoid robot RH5. The results indicate the potential of Transformers in humanoid state estimation, but also highlight the need for robust autoregressive training in these high-dimensional problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 22nd International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[How Robot Dogs See the Unseeable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16262v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Peering, a side-to-side motion used by animals to estimate distance through motion parallax, offers a powerful bio-inspired strategy to overcome a fundamental limitation in robotic vision: partial occlusion. Conventional robot cameras, with their small apertures and large depth of field, render both foreground obstacles and background objects in sharp focus, causing occluders to obscure critical scene information. This work establishes a formal connection between animal peering and synthetic aperture (SA) sensing from optical imaging. By having a robot execute a peering motion, its camera describes a wide synthetic aperture. Computational integration of the captured images synthesizes an image with an extremely shallow depth of field, effectively blurring out occluding elements while bringing the background into sharp focus. This efficient, wavelength-independent technique enables real-time, high-resolution perception across various spectral bands. We demonstrate that this approach not only restores basic scene understanding but also empowers advanced visual reasoning in large multimodal models, which fail with conventionally occluded imagery. Unlike feature-dependent multi-view 3D vision methods or active sensors like LiDAR, SA sensing via peering is robust to occlusion, computationally efficient, and immediately deployable on any mobile robot. This research bridges animal behavior and robotics, suggesting that peering motions for synthetic aperture sensing are a key to advanced scene understanding in complex, cluttered environments.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce DynaMimicGen (D-MG), a scalable dataset generation framework that enables policy training from minimal human supervision while uniquely supporting dynamic task settings. Given only a few human demonstrations, D-MG first segments the demonstrations into meaningful sub-tasks, then leverages Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to adapt and generalize the demonstrated behaviors to novel and dynamically changing environments. Improving prior methods that rely on static assumptions or simplistic trajectory interpolation, D-MG produces smooth, realistic, and task-consistent Cartesian trajectories that adapt in real time to changes in object poses, robot states, or scene geometry during task execution. Our method supports different scenarios - including scene layouts, object instances, and robot configurations - making it suitable for both static and highly dynamic manipulation tasks. We show that robot agents trained via imitation learning on D-MG-generated data achieve strong performance across long-horizon and contact-rich benchmarks, including tasks like cube stacking and placing mugs in drawers, even under unpredictable environment changes. By eliminating the need for extensive human demonstrations and enabling generalization in dynamic settings, D-MG offers a powerful and efficient alternative to manual data collection, paving the way toward scalable, autonomous robot learning.</p></details> |  |

Such systems are flexibly configurable and can include a large number of independently actuated shuttles (movers) that dynamically rebalance production capacity. Beyond their capabilities for dynamic transportation, these systems possess the inherent yet unexploited potential to perform manipulation. By merging the fields of transportation and manipulation into a coordinated swarm of magnetic robots (MagBots), we enable manufacturing systems to achieve significantly higher efficiency, adaptability, and compactness. To support the development of intelligent algorithms for magnetic levitation systems, we introduce MagBotSim (Magnetic Robotics Simulation): a physics-based simulation for magnetic levitation systems. By framing magnetic levitation systems as robot swarms and providing a dedicated simulation, this work lays the foundation for next generation manufacturing systems powered by Magnetic Robotics.

| **[Relative Pose Estimation for Nonholonomic Robot Formation with UWB-IO Measurements (Extended version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05481v4)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article studies the problem of distributed formation control for multiple robots by using onboard ultra wide band (UWB) distance and inertial odometer (IO) measurements. Although this problem has been widely studied, a fundamental limitation of most works is that they require each robot's pose and sensor measurements are expressed in a common reference frame. However, it is inapplicable for nonholonomic robot formations due to the practical difficulty of aligning IO measurements of individual robot in a common frame. To address this problem, firstly, a concurrent-learning based estimator is firstly proposed to achieve relative localization between neighboring robots in a local frame. Different from most relative localization methods in a global frame, both relative position and orientation in a local frame are estimated with only UWB ranging and IO measurements. Secondly, to deal with information loss caused by directed communication topology, a cooperative localization algorithm is introduced to estimate the relative pose to the leader robot. Thirdly, based on the theoretical results on relative pose estimation, a distributed formation tracking controller is proposed for nonholonomic robots. Both 3D and 2D real-world experiments conducted on aerial robots and grounded robots are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 17 pages, 26 figures |

We introduce Bi-AQUA, the first underwater bilateral control-based imitation learning framework that integrates lighting-aware visual processing for underwater robot arms. Bi-AQUA employs a hierarchical three-level lighting adaptation mechanism: a Lighting Encoder that extracts lighting representations from RGB images without manual annotation and is implicitly supervised by the imitation objective, FiLM modulation of visual backbone features for adaptive, lighting-aware feature extraction, and an explicit lighting token added to the transformer encoder input for task-aware conditioning. Experiments on a real-world underwater pick-and-place task under diverse static and dynamic lighting conditions show that Bi-AQUA achieves robust performance and substantially outperforms a bilateral baseline without lighting modeling. Ablation studies further confirm that all three lighting-aware components are critical. This work bridges terrestrial bilateral control-based imitation learning and underwater manipulation, enabling force-sensitive autonomous operation in challenging marine environments.

Sound offers a powerful channel for interaction, encompassing both operational noises and intentionally designed auditory cues. In this study, we examined the effects of consequential and functional sounds on human perception and behavior, including a novel exploration of spatial sound through localization and handover tasks. Results show that consequential sounds of the Kinova Gen3 manipulator did not negatively affect perceptions, spatial localization is highly accurate for lateral cues but declines for frontal cues, and spatial sounds can simultaneously convey task-relevant information while promoting warmth and reducing discomfort. These findings highlight the potential of functional and transformative auditory design to enhance human-robot collaboration and inform future sound-based interaction strategies.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Grounding LLMs For Robot Task Planning Using Closed-loop State Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08546v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning algorithms decompose complex problems into intermediate steps that can be sequentially executed by robots to complete tasks. Recent works have employed Large Language Models (LLMs) for task planning, using natural language to generate robot policies in both simulation and real-world environments. LLMs like GPT-4 have shown promising results in generalizing to unseen tasks, but their applicability is limited due to hallucinations caused by insufficient grounding in the robot environment. The robustness of LLMs in task planning can be enhanced with environmental state information and feedback. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to task planning that utilizes two separate LLMs for high-level planning and low-level control, improving task-related success rates and goal condition recall. Our algorithm, \textit{BrainBody-LLM}, draws inspiration from the human neural system, emulating its brain-body architecture by dividing planning across two LLMs in a structured, hierarchical manner. BrainBody-LLM implements a closed-loop feedback mechanism, enabling learning from simulator errors to resolve execution errors in complex settings. We demonstrate the successful application of BrainBody-LLM in the VirtualHome simulation environment, achieving a 29\% improvement in task-oriented success rates over competitive baselines with the GPT-4 backend. Additionally, we evaluate our algorithm on seven complex tasks using a realistic physics simulator and the Franka Research 3 robotic arm, comparing it with various state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results show advancements in the reasoning capabilities of recent LLMs, which enable them to learn from raw simulator/controller errors to correct plans, making them highly effective in robotic task planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

| **[I've Changed My Mind: Robots Adapting to Changing Human Goals during Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15914v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For effective human-robot collaboration, a robot must align its actions with human goals, even as they change mid-task. Prior approaches often assume fixed goals, reducing goal prediction to a one-time inference. However, in real-world scenarios, humans frequently shift goals, making it challenging for robots to adapt without explicit communication. We propose a method for detecting goal changes by tracking multiple candidate action sequences and verifying their plausibility against a policy bank. Upon detecting a change, the robot refines its belief in relevant past actions and constructs Receding Horizon Planning (RHP) trees to actively select actions that assist the human while encouraging Differentiating Actions to reveal their updated goal. We evaluate our approach in a collaborative cooking environment with up to 30 unique recipes and compare it to three comparable human goal prediction algorithms. Our method outperforms all baselines, quickly converging to the correct goal after a switch, reducing task completion time, and improving collaboration efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted to RA-L |

Our paper introduces the Optimus-Q robot, a sophisticated system designed to autonomously monitor air quality and detect contamination while leveraging adaptive learning techniques and secure quantum communication. Equipped with advanced infrared sensors, the Optimus-Q robot continuously streams real-time environmental data to predict hazardous gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH$_4$). Utilizing a federated learning approach, the robot collaborates with other systems across various NPPs to improve its predictive capabilities without compromising data privacy. Additionally, the implementation of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) ensures secure data transmission, safeguarding sensitive operational information. Our methodology combines systematic navigation patterns with machine learning algorithms to facilitate efficient coverage of designated areas, thereby optimizing contamination monitoring processes. Through simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Optimus-Q robot in enhancing operational safety and responsiveness in nuclear facilities. This research underscores the potential of integrating robotics, machine learning, and quantum technologies to revolutionize monitoring systems in hazardous environments.</p></details> |  |

One way to address the uncertainty associated with acoustic communication is to learn the communication environment in real-time. We address the challenge of a team of robots building a map of the probability of communication success from one location to another in real-time. This is a decentralized classification problem -- communication events are either successful or unsuccessful -- where AUVs share a subset of their communication measurements to build the map. The main contribution of this work is a rigorously derived data sharing policy that selects measurements to be shared among AUVs. We experimentally validate our proposed sharing policy using real acoustic communication data collected from teams of Virginia Tech 690 AUVs, demonstrating its effectiveness in underwater environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, IROS 2025 conference</p></details> |

In this vein, this paper proposes an integrated framework for grasping with formal safety guarantees based on Control Barrier Functions. We first design contact force and force closure constraints, which are enforced by a safety filter to accomplish safe grasping with finger force control. For sensory feedback, we develop a technique to estimate contact point, force, and torque from tactile sensors at each finger. We verify the framework with various safety filters in a numerical simulation under a two-finger grasping scenario. We then experimentally validate the framework by grasping multiple objects, including fragile lab glassware, in a real robotic setup, showing that safe grasping can be successfully achieved in the real world. We evaluate the performance of each safety filter in the context of safety violation and conservatism, and find that disturbance observer-based control barrier functions provide superior performance for safety guarantees with minimum conservatism.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to ECC 2025.

To overcome this fundamental limitation and barrier for wider adoption, we propose the concept of robotic aerial base stations (RABSs) that are equipped with energy-neutral anchoring end-effectors able to autonomously grasp or perch on tall urban landforms. Thanks to the energy-efficient anchoring operation, RABSs could offer seamless wireless connectivity for multiple hours compared to minutes of the typical hovering-based ABSs. Therefore, the prolonged service capabilities of RABSs allowing them to integrate into the radio access network and augment the network capacity where and when needed. To set the scene, we discuss the key components of the proposed RABS concept including hardware, workflow, communication considerations, and regulation issues. Then, the advantages of RABSs are highlighted which is followed by case studies that compare RABSs with terrestrial micro BSs and other types of non-terrestrial communication infrastructure, such as hovering-based, tethered, and laser-powered ABSs.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method uses a particle swarm optimization algorithm that explores the search space to find positions for performing the trajectory. An $α$-shape algorithm is then used to draw the borders of the feasibility areas, and the largest circle inscribed is calculated from the Voronoi diagrams. The aim of this approach is to provide a robustness criterion in the context of robot placement inaccuracies that may be encountered, for example, if the robot is placed on a mobile base when the system is deployed by an operator. The approach developed uses an inverse kinematics model to evaluate all initial configurations, then moves the robot end-effector along the reference trajectory using the Jacobian matrix and assigns a score to the attempt. For the Fanuc CRX10iA/L robot, there can be up to 16 solutions to the inverse kinematics model. The calculation of these solutions is not trivial and requires a specific study that planning tools such as MoveIt cannot fully take into account. Additionally, the optimization process must consider constraints such as joint limits, singularities, and workspace limitations to ensure feasible and efficient trajectory execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Look, Zoom, Understand: The Robotic Eyeball for Embodied Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15279v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embodied AI perception systems, visual perception should be active: the goal is not to passively process static images, but to actively acquire more informative data within pixel and spatial budget constraints. Existing vision models and fixed RGB-D camera systems fundamentally fail to reconcile wide-area coverage with fine-grained detail acquisition, severely limiting their efficacy in open-world robotic applications. To address this issue, we propose EyeVLA, a robotic eyeball for active visual perception that can take proactive actions based on instructions, enabling clear observation of fine-grained target objects and detailed information across a wide spatial extent. EyeVLA discretizes action behaviors into action tokens and integrates them with vision-language models (VLMs) that possess strong open-world understanding capabilities, enabling joint modeling of vision, language, and actions within a single autoregressive sequence. By using the 2D bounding box coordinates to guide the reasoning chain and applying reinforcement learning to refine the viewpoint selection policy, we transfer the open-world scene understanding capability of the VLM to a vision language action (VLA) policy using only minimal real-world data. Experiments show that our system efficiently performs instructed scenes in real-world environments and actively acquires more accurate visual information through instruction-driven actions of rotation and zoom, thereby achieving strong environmental perception capabilities. EyeVLA introduces a novel robotic vision system that leverages detailed and spatially rich, large-scale embodied data, and actively acquires highly informative visual observations for downstream embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

BTs structure behavior hierarchically using control-flow, whereas EO represents the domain as a temporal, event-based semantic graph driven by dataflow rules. We demonstrate that EO achieves comparable reactivity and modularity to BTs through a fundamentally different architecture: replacing polling-based tick execution with event-driven state propagation. We propose that EO offers an alternative framework, moving from procedural programming to semantic domain modeling, to address the semantic-process gap in traditional robotic control. EO supports runtime model modification, full temporal traceability, and a unified representation of data, logic, and interface - features that are difficult or sometimes impossible to achieve with BTs, although BTs excel in established, predictable scenarios. The comparison is grounded in a practical mobile manipulation task. This comparison highlights the respective operational strengths of each approach in dynamic, evolving robotic systems.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |

We present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning framework built on diffusion-based visuomotor policies. RL-100 unifies imitation and reinforcement learning under a single PPO-style objective applied within the denoising process, yielding conservative and stable policy improvements across both offline and online stages. To meet deployment latency constraints, we employ a lightweight consistency distillation procedure that compresses multi-step diffusion into a one-step controller for high-frequency control. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic, and supports both single-action outputs and action-chunking control. We evaluate RL-100 on seven diverse real-robot manipulation tasks, ranging from dynamic pushing and agile bowling to pouring, cloth folding, unscrewing, and multi-stage juicing. RL-100 attains 100% success across evaluated trials, achieving 900 out of 900 successful episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task, and matches or surpasses expert teleoperators in time-to-completion. Without retraining, a single policy attains approximately 90% zero-shot success under environmental and dynamics shifts, adapts in a few-shot regime to significant task variations (86.7%), and remains robust to aggressive human perturbations (about 95%). In a public shopping-mall deployment, the juicing robot served random customers continuously for roughly seven hours without failure. Together, these results suggest a practical path toward deployment-ready robot learning: start from human priors, align training objectives with human-grounded metrics, and reliably extend performance beyond human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://lei-kun.github.io/RL-100/</p></details> |

For a multi-agent system with complex asynchronous interactions and concurrency, formal verification, model-checking in particular, offers an automated mechanism for verifying desired properties. Timed Rebeca is an actor-based modelling language supporting reactive, concurrent and time semantics, accompanied with a model-checking compiler. These capabilities allow using Timed Rebeca to correctly model ROS2 node topographies, recurring physical signals, motion primitives and other timed and time-convertible behaviors. The biggest challenges in modelling and verifying a multi-robot system lie in abstracting complex information, bridging the gap between a discrete model and a continuous system and compacting the state space, while maintaining the model's accuracy. We develop different discretization strategies for different kinds of information, identifying the 'enough' thresholds of abstraction, and applying efficient optimization techniques to boost computations. With this work we demonstrate how to use models to design and verify a multi-robot system, how to discretely model a continuous system to do model-checking efficiently, and the round-trip engineering flow between the model and the implementation. The released Rebeca and ROS2 codes can serve as a foundation for modelling multiple autonomous robots systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eq.Bot: Enhance Robotic Manipulation Learning via Group Equivariant Canonicalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15194v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation systems are increasingly deployed across diverse domains. Yet existing multi-modal learning frameworks lack inherent guarantees of geometric consistency, struggling to handle spatial transformations such as rotations and translations. While recent works attempt to introduce equivariance through bespoke architectural modifications, these methods suffer from high implementation complexity, computational cost, and poor portability. Inspired by human cognitive processes in spatial reasoning, we propose Eq.Bot, a universal canonicalization framework grounded in SE(2) group equivariant theory for robotic manipulation learning. Our framework transforms observations into a canonical space, applies an existing policy, and maps the resulting actions back to the original space. As a model-agnostic solution, Eq.Bot aims to endow models with spatial equivariance without requiring architectural modifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Eq.Bot under both CNN-based (e.g., CLIPort) and Transformer-based (e.g., OpenVLA-OFT) architectures over existing methods on various robotic manipulation tasks, where the most significant improvement can reach 50.0%.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[GPA-RAM: Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba for Spatial Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19683v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task failures in prior fine-grained robotic manipulation methods often stem from suboptimal initial grasping, which is critical for subsequent manipulation and reducing the requirement for complex pose adjustments. To address this, we propose Grasp-Pretraining Augmentation (GPA), a general multi-modal learning framework that enhances grasp perception without additional grasp pose data collection and labeling. GPA achieves evident enhancement on RLBench multi-task benchmark (from 79.3% to 84.2%) and ALOHA bimanual manipulation tasks (from 86%/16% to 98%/38%). Although GPA enhances fine-grained grasping performance by leveraging increased model capacity, it incurs computational latency and hinders real-time deployment. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Robotic Attention Mamba (RAM). This architecture synergizes attention mechanisms with state space models (SSMs), effectively capturing complex spatial features while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our unified GPA-RAM framework balances model capacity with efficiency and applies to both discrete and continuous action generation. GPA-RAM demonstrates superior performance across four robotic systems with diverse camera configurations in both simulation and the real world. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, it improves average success rates by 8.2% over RVT2 (from 79.3% to 87.5%) and 2.6% over ARP^+ (from 84.9% to 87.5%) on the RLBench multi-task benchmark and 40% (from 16% to 56%), 12% (from 86% to 98%) on ALOHA bimanual continuous tasks, with inference speed of about 71 FPS. This work provides a framework for developing robotic systems that are simultaneously precise and responsive. The project and code are at https://gpa-ram.github.io/</p></details> |  |

We introduce a modular design framework that selects the forward velocity to decouple the radial coordinate, allowing the steering subsystem to be stabilized independently. Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium. The framework generalizes and extends prior modular and nonmodular approaches, while preparing the ground for inverse optimal and adaptive redesigns in the sequel paper.</p></details> |  |

This interdisciplinary area integrates scene understanding, language processing, and policy learning to bridge the gap between human instructions and robot actions. In this comprehensive survey, we systematically explore recent advancements in language-conditioned robot manipulation. We categorize existing methods based on the primary ways language is integrated into the robot system, namely language for state evaluation, language as a policy condition, and language for cognitive planning and reasoning. Specifically, we further analyze state-of-the-art techniques from four axes of action granularity, data and supervision regimes, system cost and latency, and environments and evaluations. Additionally, we highlight the key debates in the field. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future research directions, focusing on potentially enhancing generalization capabilities and addressing safety issues in language-conditioned robot manipulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Natural Selection via Foundation Models for Soft Robot Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02249v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing soft robots is a complex and iterative process that demands cross-disciplinary expertise in materials science, mechanics, and control, often relying on intuition and extensive experimentation. While foundation models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities, their capacity to conduct embodied design remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces RoboCrafter-QA, a novel benchmark to evaluate whether LLMs can learn representations of soft robot designs that effectively bridge the gap between high-level task descriptions and low-level morphological and material choices. RoboCrafter-QA leverages the EvoGym simulator to generate a diverse set of soft robot design challenges, spanning robotic locomotion, manipulation, and balancing tasks. Our experiments with SOTA multi-modal LLMs reveal that while these models exhibit promising capabilities in learning design representations, they struggle with fine-grained distinctions between designs with subtle performance differences. To overcome these limitations, we finetune an efficient, open-source LLM that achieves SOTA performance on our benchmark, demonstrating superior capabilities in both design selection and direct generation of high-performing robot morphologies. Furthermore, we construct a physical replica of the modular soft robot and demonstrate a strong sim-to-real correlation, validating that superior benchmark performance has the potential to translate to effective real-world design selection. Our full system will be open-sourced to foster this exciting direction.</p></details> |  |

We pursue a road less traveled: building generalist policies directly around VLMs by augmenting their general capabilities with specific robot capabilities encapsulated in a carefully curated set of perception, planning, and control modules. In Maestro, a VLM coding agent dynamically composes these modules into a programmatic policy for the current task and scenario. Maestro's architecture benefits from a streamlined closed-loop interface without many manually imposed structural constraints, and a comprehensive and diverse tool repertoire. As a result, it largely surpasses today's VLA models for zero-shot performance on challenging manipulation skills. Further, Maestro is easily extensible to incorporate new modules, easily editable to suit new embodiments such as a quadruped-mounted arm, and even easily adapts from minimal real-world experiences through local code edits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Plan ...</summary><p>Plan to resubmit after significant revisions</p></details> |

However, existing methods for enforcing time-varying constraints often overlook model uncertainties. To address this issue, this paper proposes a CBFs-based robust adaptive controller design endowing time-varying constraints while considering parametric uncertainty and additive disturbances. To this end, we first leverage Robust adaptive Control Barrier Functions (RaCBFs) to handle model uncertainty, along with the concept of Input-to-State Safety (ISSf) to ensure robustness towards input disturbances. Furthermore, to alleviate the inherent conservatism in robustness, we also incorporate a set membership identification scheme. We demonstrate the proposed method on robotic surface treatment that requires time-varying force bounds to ensure uniform quality, in numerical simulation and real robotic setup, showing that the quality is formally guaranteed within an acceptable range.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to ECC 2025</p></details> |

To this end, we propose tactile sensing-based reward shaping and incorporate the sensing into the observation space through embedding. The designed rewards encourage an agent to ensure firm grasping and smooth finger gaiting at the same time, leading to higher data efficiency and robust performance compared to the baseline. We verify the proposed framework on the opening a lid scenario, showing generalization of the trained policy into a couple of object types and various dynamics such as torsional friction.

Yet, translating these advantages into endoscopic interventions within open cavities remains challenging. The lack of anatomical constraints and the inherent flexibility of such devices complicate their control, while the limited field of view of endoscopes restricts situational awareness. We present a robotic platform designed to overcome these challenges and demonstrate its potential in fetoscopic laser coagulation, a complex MIS procedure typically performed only by highly experienced surgeons. Our system combines a magnetically actuated flexible endoscope with teleoperated and semi-autonomous navigation capabilities for performing targeted laser ablations. To enhance surgical awareness, the platform reconstructs real-time mosaics of the endoscopic scene, providing an extended and continuous visual context. The ability of this system to address the key limitations of MIS in open spaces is validated in vivo in an ovine model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards A Catalogue of Requirement Patterns for Space Robotic Missions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14438v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the development of safety and mission-critical systems, including autonomous space robotic missions, complex behaviour is captured during the requirements elicitation phase. Requirements are typically expressed using natural language which is ambiguous and not amenable to formal verification methods that can provide robust guarantees of system behaviour. To support the definition of formal requirements, specification patterns provide reusable, logic-based templates. A suite of robotic specification patterns, along with their formalisation in NASA's Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET) already exists. These pre-existing requirement patterns are domain agnostic and, in this paper we explore their applicability for space missions. To achieve this we carried out a literature review of existing space missions and formalised their requirements using FRET, contributing a corpus of space mission requirements. We categorised these requirements using pre-existing specification patterns which demonstrated their applicability in space missions. However, not all of the requirements that we formalised corresponded to an existing pattern so we have contributed 5 new requirement specification patterns as well as several variants of the existing and new patterns. We also conducted an expert evaluation of the new patterns, highlighting their benefits and limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings FMAS 2025, arXiv:2511.13245</p></details> |

In this paper, we contribute the Safe-ROS architecture for developing reliable and verifiable autonomous robots in such domains. It features two distinct subsystems: (1) an intelligent control system that is responsible for normal/routine operations, and (2) a Safety System consisting of Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs) that provide formally verifiable independent oversight. We demonstrate Safe-ROS on an AgileX Scout Mini robot performing autonomous inspection in a nuclear environment. One safety requirement is selected and instantiated as a SIF. To support verification, we implement the SIF as a cognitive agent, programmed to stop the robot whenever it detects that it is too close to an obstacle. We verify that the agent meets the safety requirement and integrate it into the autonomous inspection. This integration is also verified, and the full deployment is validated in a Gazebo simulation, and lab testing. We evaluate this architecture in the context of the UK nuclear sector, where safety and regulation are crucial aspects of deployment. Success criteria include the development of a formal property from the safety requirement, implementation, and verification of the SIF, and the integration of the SIF into the operational robotic autonomous system. Our results demonstrate that the Safe-ROS architecture can provide safety verifiable oversight while deploying autonomous robots in safety-critical domains, offering a robust framework that can be extended to additional requirements and various applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings FMAS 2025, arXiv:2511.13245</p></details> |
| **[Mutation Testing for Industrial Robotic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14432v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial robotic systems (IRS) are increasingly deployed in diverse environments, where failures can result in severe accidents and costly downtime. Ensuring the reliability of the software controlling these systems is therefore critical. Mutation testing, a technique widely used in software engineering, evaluates the effectiveness of test suites by introducing small faults, or mutants, into the code. However, traditional mutation operators are poorly suited to robotic programs, which involve message-based commands and interactions with the physical world. This paper explores the adaptation of mutation testing to IRS by defining domain-specific mutation operators that capture the semantics of robot actions and sensor readings. We propose a methodology for generating meaningful mutants at the level of high-level read and write operations, including movement, gripper actions, and sensor noise injection. An empirical study on a pick-and-place scenario demonstrates that our approach produces more informative mutants and reduces the number of invalid or equivalent cases compared to conventional operators. Results highlight the potential of mutation testing to enhance test suite quality and contribute to safer, more reliable industrial robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings FMAS 2025, arXiv:2511.13245</p></details> |

However, Reinforcement Learning agents struggle to learn in such multisensory settings, especially amidst sensory noise and dynamic changes. We propose MultiSensory Dynamic Pretraining (MSDP), a novel framework for learning expressive multisensory representations tailored for task-oriented policy learning. MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP. Our approach exhibits strong robustness to perturbations and achieves high success rates on the real robot with as few as 6,000 online interactions, offering a simple yet powerful solution for complex multisensory robotic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures, preprint</p></details> |

This paper presents a two-layer framework that combines high-level scheduling with low-level control. Tasks are assigned and scheduled using the compositional algorithm ComSat, which generates time-parameterized routes for each robot. These schedules are then used by a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) system in real time to compute local reference trajectories, accounting for static and dynamic obstacles. The approach ensures safe, collision-free operation, and supports rapid rescheduling in response to disruptions such as robot failures or environmental changes. We evaluate the method in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic conditions, demonstrating high task completion rates and robust behavior even under congestion. The modular structure of the framework allows for computational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for deployment in complex, real-world industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Variable Force Characterisation method for Human-Robot Interaction in Wearable Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14327v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physical interaction with wearable robots is essential to ensure safety and comfort. However, this interaction is complex in two key aspects: (1) the motion involved, and (2) the non-linear behaviour of soft tissues. Multiple approaches have been undertaken to better understand this interaction and to improve the quantitative metrics of physical interfaces or cuffs. As these two topics are closely interrelated, finite modelling and soft tissue characterisation offer valuable insights into pressure distribution and shear stress induced by the cuff. Nevertheless, current characterisation methods typically rely on a single fitting variable along one degree of freedom, which limits their applicability, given that interactions with wearable robots often involve multiple degrees of freedom. To address this limitation, this work introduces a dual-variable characterisation method, involving normal and tangential forces, aimed at identifying reliable material parameters and evaluating the impact of single-variable fitting on force and torque responses. This method demonstrates the importance of incorporating two variables into the characterisation process by analysing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) across different scenarios and material models, providing a foundation for simulation at the closest possible level, with a focus on the cuff and the human limb involved in the physical interaction between the user and the wearable robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 10 figures, submitted and under-review in Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials</p></details> |

When operating these systems, real-time estimation and control require fast and accurate models. However, prediction with first-principles (FP) models is slow, and learned black-box models have poor generalizability. Physics-informed machine learning offers excellent advantages here, but it is currently limited to simple, often simulated systems without considering changes after training. We propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for articulated soft robots (ASRs) with a focus on data efficiency. The amount of expensive real-world training data is reduced to a minimum -- one dataset in one system domain. Two hours of data in different domains are used for a comparison against two gold-standard approaches: In contrast to a recurrent neural network, the PINN provides a high generalizability. The prediction speed of an accurate FP model is exceeded with the PINN by up to a factor of 467 at slightly reduced accuracy. This enables nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) of a pneumatic ASR. Accurate position tracking with the MPC running at 47 Hz is achieved in six dynamic experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO) 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods lack spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem, we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic manipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning. Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation module to model spatially guided predictions through the spatial plan table. Then, we propose a flow-based action prediction module to infer executable actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive experiments show that SP substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving over 33% improvement on Meta-World and over 25% improvement on iTHOR, demonstrating strong effectiveness across 23 embodied control tasks. We additionally evaluate SP in real-world robotic experiments to verify its practical viability. SP enhances the practicality of embodied models for robotic control applications.

However, effective communication between road users and AVs remains a significant challenge. Although various external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) have been developed to facilitate interactions, psychological factors, such as a lack of trust and inadequate emotional signaling, may still deter users from confidently engaging with AVs in certain contexts. To address this gap, we propose TailCue, an exploration of how tail-based eHMIs affect user interaction with AVs. We first investigated mappings between tail movements and emotional expressions from robotics and zoology, and accordingly developed a motion-emotion mapping scheme. A physical robotic tail was implemented, and specific tail motions were designed based on our scheme. An online, video-based user study with 21 participants was conducted. Our findings suggest that, although the intended emotions conveyed by the tail were not consistently recognized, open-ended feedback indicated that the tail motion needs to align with the scenarios and cues. Our result highlights the necessity of scenario-specific optimization to enhance tail-based eHMIs. Future work will refine tail movement strategies to maximize their effectiveness across diverse interaction contexts.</p></details> |  |

This convergence enables machines to perceive, reason and interact with complex environments through natural language and spatial understanding, bridging the gap between linguistic intelligence and spatial perception. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art methodologies, applications and challenges at the intersection of LLMs and 3D vision, with a focus on next-generation robotic sensing technologies.

Furthermore, we discuss multimodal LLMs that integrate 3D data with touch, auditory and thermal inputs, enhancing environmental comprehension and robotic decision-making. To support future research, we catalog benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics tailored for 3D-language and vision tasks.

In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding. Together, these components enable temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction. Experiments show Embodied-SlotSSM's baseline performance on LIBERO-Mem and general tasks, offering a scalable solution for non-Markovian reasoning in object-centric robotic policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

These applications usually involve navigating at high speeds through constrained spaces such as small gaps. Navigating such constrained spaces becomes particularly challenging when the space is crowded with multiple heterogeneous agents all of which have urgent priorities. What makes the problem even harder is that during an active response situation, roles and priorities can quickly change on a dime without informing the other agents. In order to complete missions in such environments, robots must not only be safe, but also agile, able to dodge and change course at a moment's notice. In this paper, we propose FACA, a fair and agile collision avoidance approach where robots coordinate their tasks by talking to each other via natural language (just as people do). In FACA, robots balance safety with agility via a novel artificial potential field algorithm that creates an automatic ``roundabout'' effect whenever a conflict arises. Our experiments show that FACA achieves a improvement in efficiency, completing missions more than 3.5X faster than baselines with a time reduction of over 70% while maintaining robust safety margins.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong high-level reasoning capabilities, the lack of safety guarantees limits their direct use in critical decision-making. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical optimization framework that integrates LLMs into the decision loop for multi-robot target tracking in dynamic and hazardous environments. Rather than generating control actions directly, LLMs are used to generate task configuration and adjust parameters in a bi-level task allocation and planning problem. We formulate multi-robot coordination for tracking tasks as a bi-level optimization problem, with LLMs to reason about potential hazards in the environment and the status of the robot team and modify both the inner and outer levels of the optimization. This hierarchical approach enables real-time adjustments to the robots' behavior. Additionally, a human supervisor can offer broad guidance and assessments to address unexpected dangers, model mismatches, and performance issues arising from local minima. We validate our proposed framework in both simulation and real-world experiments with comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness and showcasing its capability for safe LLM integration for multi-robot systems.</p></details> |  |

Few platforms exist today for SAR, and fewer still have the ability to cover both tasks of terrain adaptability and high-force output when performing extraction. While legged robots offer significant ability to traverse uneven terrain, they typically are unable to incorporate mechanisms that provide variable high-force outputs, unlike traditional wheel-based drive trains. This work introduces a novel concept for a dynamically extensible and retractable robot leg. Leveraging a dynamically extensible and retractable five-bar linkage design, it allows for mechanically switching between height-advantaged and force-advantaged configurations via a geometric transformation. A testbed evaluated leg performance across linkage geometries and operating modes, with empirical and analytical analyses conducted on stride length, force output, and stability. The results demonstrate that the morphing leg offers a promising path toward SAR robots that can both navigate terrain quickly and perform rescue tasks effectively.</p></details> |  |

Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand design: the difficulty of achieving both stable power grasps and precise, fine-grained manipulation within a single, versatile system. In this work, we bridge this gap by jointly optimizing the control and hardware design of a multi-fingered dexterous hand, enabling both power and precision manipulation. Rather than redesigning the entire hand, we introduce a lightweight fingertip geometry modification, represent it as a contact plane, and jointly optimize its parameters along with the corresponding control. Our control strategy dynamically switches between power and precision manipulation and simplifies precision control into parallel thumb-index motions, which proves robust for sim-to-real transfer. On the design side, we leverage large-scale simulation to optimize the fingertip geometry using a differentiable neural-physics surrogate model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings. Our method achieves an 82.5% zero-shot success rate on unseen objects in sim-to-real precision grasping, and a 93.3% success rate in challenging real-world tasks involving bread pinching. These results demonstrate that our co-design framework can significantly enhance the fine-grained manipulation ability of multi-fingered hands without reducing their ability for power grasps.

Caregiving tasks involve complex physical human-robot interactions, requiring precise perception under occlusions, safe physical contact, and long-horizon planning. While recent advances in robot learning from demonstrations have shown promise, there is a lack of a large-scale, diverse, and expert-driven dataset that captures real-world caregiving routines. To address this gap, we collect data from 21 occupational therapists performing 15 ADL tasks on two manikins. The dataset spans five modalities: RGB-D video, pose tracking, eye-gaze tracking, task and action annotations, and tactile sensing, providing rich multimodal insights into caregiver movement, attention, force application, and task execution strategies. We further analyze expert caregiving principles and strategies, offering insights to improve robot efficiency and task feasibility. Additionally, our evaluations demonstrate that OpenRoboCare presents challenges for state-of-the-art robot perception and human activity recognition methods, both critical for developing safe and adaptive assistive robots, highlighting the value of our contribution.

This paper investigates E2E robot navigation in unstructured road environments. First, we introduce two data collection pipelines - one for real-world robot data and another for synthetic data generated using the Isaac Sim simulator, which together produce an unstructured robotics navigation dataset -- FreeWorld Dataset. Second, we fine-tuned an efficient E2E autonomous driving model -- VAD -- using our datasets to validate the performance and adaptability of E2E autonomous driving models in these environments. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning through our datasets significantly enhances the navigation potential of E2E autonomous driving models in unstructured robotic environments. Thus, this paper presents the first dataset targeting E2E robot navigation tasks in unstructured scenarios, and provides a benchmark based on vision-based E2E autonomous driving algorithms to facilitate the development of E2E navigation technology for logistics and service robots.

| **[Towards Affect-Adaptive Human-Robot Interaction: A Protocol for Multimodal Dataset Collection on Social Anxiety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13530v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social anxiety is a prevalent condition that affects interpersonal interactions and social functioning. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and social robotics offer new opportunities to examine social anxiety in the human-robot interaction context. Accurate detection of affective states and behaviours associated with social anxiety requires multimodal datasets, where each signal modality provides complementary insights into its manifestations. However, such datasets remain scarce, limiting progress in both research and applications. To address this, this paper presents a protocol for multimodal dataset collection designed to reflect social anxiety in a human-robot interaction context. The dataset will consist of synchronised audio, video, and physiological recordings acquired from at least 70 participants, grouped according to their level of social anxiety, as they engage in approximately 10-minute interactive Wizard-of-Oz role-play scenarios with the Furhat social robot under controlled experimental conditions. In addition to multimodal data, the dataset will be enriched with contextual data providing deeper insight into individual variability in social anxiety responses. This work can contribute to research on affect-adaptive human-robot interaction by providing support for robust multimodal detection of social anxiety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Workshop on Benefits of pErsonalization and behAvioral adaptation in assistive Robots (BEAR 2025), held at the IEEE RO-MAN Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking LLM Privacy Recognition for Social Robot Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16124v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While robots have previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to develop LLM-powered robots for enhanced human-robot interaction (HRI). To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within private environments, such as homes. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks, evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the context of household robots. In this work, we present a set of privacy-relevant scenarios developed using the Contextual Integrity (CI) framework. We first surveyed users' privacy preferences regarding in-home robot behaviors and then examined how their privacy orientations affected their choices of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provided the same set of scenarios and questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and found that the agreement between humans and LLMs was generally low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as potential privacy controllers, we implemented four additional prompting strategies and compared their results. We discuss the performance of the evaluated models as well as the implications and potential of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Informative Communication of Robot Plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13226v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When a robot is asked to verbalize its plan it can do it in many ways. For example, a seemingly natural strategy is incremental, where the robot verbalizes its planned actions in plan order. However, an important aspect of this type of strategy is that it misses considerations on what is effectively informative to communicate, because not considering what the user knows prior to explanations. In this paper we propose a verbalization strategy to communicate robot plans informatively, by measuring the information gain that verbalizations have against a second-order theory of mind of the user capturing his prior knowledge on the robot. As shown in our experiments, this strategy allows to understand the robot's goal much quicker than by using strategies such as increasing or decreasing plan order. In addition, following our formulation we hint to what is informative and why when a robot communicates its plan.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference: PAAMS 2022, 20th International Conference on Practical Applications of Agents and Multi-Agent Systems</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Autonomous Exploration-Based Precise Mapping for Mobile Robots through Stepwise and Consistent Motions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17005v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a 2-D autonomous exploration and mapping framework for LiDAR-based SLAM mobile robots, designed to address the major challenges on low-cost platforms, including process instability, map drift, and increased risks of collisions and deadlocks. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. For local exploration, the proposed Self-Convergent RRT (SC-RRT) efficiently covers the reachable space within a finite time while the robot remains stationary, without relying on motion-induced sampling diversity. In addition, traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is employed to generate motion trajectories that are more amenable to stable scan matching. The resulting straight-segment and in-place-rotation pattern improves scan-matching robustness and effectively suppresses map drift on resource-constrained platforms. For the process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillations caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is incorporated to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency. Experiments in challenging simulated and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of the framework. Compared with baseline methods, the proposed framework achieves higher mapping success rates and stronger robustness on resource-constrained robots and maintains consistent mapping quality across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures.

The MU integrates pneumatic actuation, a compliant lattice envelope, and candidate sites for optical waveguide sensing into a single printed body. In order to study reproducibility and scalability, a parametric design framework establishes deterministic rules linking actuator chamber dimensions to lattice unit cell size. Experimental homogenization of lattice specimens provides effective material properties for finite element simulation. Within this simulation environment, sensor placement is treated as a discrete optimization problem, where a finite set of candidate waveguide paths derived from lattice nodes is evaluated by introducing local stiffening, and the configuration minimizing deviation from baseline mechanical response is selected. Optimized models are fabricated and experimentally characterized, validating the preservation of mechanical performance while enabling embedded sensing. The workflow is further extended to scaled units and a two-finger gripper, demonstrating generality of the MU concept. This approach advances monolithic soft robotic design by combining reproducible co-design rules with simulation-informed sensor integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 1 algorithm, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Unidirectional-Road-Network-Based Global Path Planning for Cleaning Robots in Semi-Structured Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13048v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practical global path planning is critical for commercializing cleaning robots working in semi-structured environments. In the literature, global path planning methods for free space usually focus on path length and neglect the traffic rule constraints of the environments, which leads to high-frequency re-planning and increases collision risks. In contrast, those for structured environments are developed mainly by strictly complying with the road network representing the traffic rule constraints, which may result in an overlong path that hinders the overall navigation efficiency. This article proposes a general and systematic approach to improve global path planning performance in semi-structured environments. A unidirectional road network is built to represent the traffic constraints in semi-structured environments and a hybrid strategy is proposed to achieve a guaranteed planning result.Cutting across the road at the starting and the goal points are allowed to achieve a shorter path. Especially, a two-layer potential map is proposed to achieve a guaranteed performance when the starting and the goal points are in complex intersections. Comparative experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Quantitative experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-art, the proposed method guarantees a much better balance between path length and the consistency with the road network.</p></details> | <details><summary>2023 ...</summary><p>2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |
| **[APP: A* Post-Processing Algorithm for Robots with Bidirectional Shortcut and Path Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13042v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Paths generated by A* and other graph-search-based planners are widely used in the robotic field. Due to the restricted node-expansion directions, the resulting paths are usually not the shortest. Besides, unnecessary heading changes, or zig-zag patterns, exist even when no obstacle is nearby, which is inconsistent with the human intuition that the path segments should be straight in wide-open space due to the absence of obstacles. This article puts forward a general and systematic post-processing algorithm for A* and other graph-search-based planners. The A* post-processing algorithm, called APP, is developed based on the costmap, which is widely used in commercial service robots. First, a bidirectional vertices reduction algorithm is proposed to tackle the asymm- etry of the path and the environments. During the forward and backward vertices reduction, a thorough shortcut strategy is put forward to improve the path-shortening performance and avoid unnecessary heading changes. Second, an iterative path perturbation algorithm is adopted to locally reduce the number of unnecessary heading changes and improve the path smooth- ness. Comparative experiments are then carried out to validate the superiority of the proposed method. Quantitative performance indexes show that APP outperforms the existing methods in planning time, path length as well as the number of unnecessary heading changes. Finally, field navigation experiments are carried out to verify the practicability of APP.</p></details> |  |
| **[SplatSearch: Instance Image Goal Navigation for Mobile Robots using 3D Gaussian Splatting and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12972v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Instance Image Goal Navigation (IIN) problem requires mobile robots deployed in unknown environments to search for specific objects or people of interest using only a single reference goal image of the target. This problem can be especially challenging when: 1) the reference image is captured from an arbitrary viewpoint, and 2) the robot must operate with sparse-view scene reconstructions. In this paper, we address the IIN problem, by introducing SplatSearch, a novel architecture that leverages sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstructions. SplatSearch renders multiple viewpoints around candidate objects using a sparse online 3DGS map, and uses a multi-view diffusion model to complete missing regions of the rendered images, enabling robust feature matching against the goal image. A novel frontier exploration policy is introduced which uses visual context from the synthesized viewpoints with semantic context from the goal image to evaluate frontier locations, allowing the robot to prioritize frontiers that are semantically and visually relevant to the goal image. Extensive experiments in photorealistic home and real-world environments validate the higher performance of SplatSearch against current state-of-the-art methods in terms of Success Rate and Success Path Length. An ablation study confirms the design choices of SplatSearch.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://splat-search.github.io/</p></details> |

Training-time strategies like procedural noise injection or learned mappings suffer from data inefficiency due to unrealistic noise simulation, which is often ineffective for grasping tasks that require fine manipulation or dependency on paired datasets heavily. Furthermore, leveraging foundation models to reduce the sim2real gap via intermediate representations fails to mitigate the domain shift fully and adds computational overhead during deployment. This work confronts dual challenges of data inefficiency and deployment complexity. We propose DiffuDepGrasp, a deploy-efficient sim2real framework enabling zero-shot transfer through simulation-exclusive policy training. Its core innovation, the Diffusion Depth Generator, synthesizes geometrically pristine simulation depth with learned sensor-realistic noise via two synergistic modules. The first Diffusion Depth Module leverages temporal geometric priors to enable sample-efficient training of a conditional diffusion model that captures complex sensor noise distributions, while the second Noise Grafting Module preserves metric accuracy during perceptual artifact injection. With only raw depth inputs during deployment, DiffuDepGrasp eliminates computational overhead and achieves a 95.7% average success rate on 12-object grasping with zero-shot transfer and strong generalization to unseen objects.Project website: https://diffudepgrasp.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOPP-DWR: Time-Optimal Path Parameterization of Differential-Driven Wheeled Robots Considering Piecewise-Constant Angular Velocity Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12910v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential-driven wheeled robots (DWR) represent the quintessential type of mobile robots and find extensive appli- cations across the robotic field. Most high-performance control approaches for DWR explicitly utilize the linear and angular velocities of the trajectory as control references. However, existing research on time-optimal path parameterization (TOPP) for mobile robots usually neglects the angular velocity and joint vel- ocity constraints, which can result in degraded control perfor- mance in practical applications. In this article, a systematic and practical TOPP algorithm named TOPP-DWR is proposed for DWR and other mobile robots. First, the non-uniform B-spline is adopted to represent the initial trajectory in the task space. Second, the piecewise-constant angular velocity, as well as joint velocity, linear velocity, and linear acceleration constraints, are incorporated into the TOPP problem. During the construction of the optimization problem, the aforementioned constraints are uniformly represented as linear velocity constraints. To boost the numerical computational efficiency, we introduce a slack variable to reformulate the problem into second-order-cone programming (SOCP). Subsequently, comparative experiments are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method. Quantitative performance indexes show that TOPP-DWR achieves TOPP while adhering to all constraints. Finally, field autonomous navigation experiments are carried out to validate the practicability of TOPP-DWR in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods for humanoid robots neglect morphological symmetry of the robot, leading to uncoordinated and suboptimal behaviors. Inspired by human motor control, we propose Symmetry Equivariant Policy (SE-Policy), a new DRL framework that embeds strict symmetry equivariance in the actor and symmetry invariance in the critic without additional hyperparameters. SE-Policy enforces consistent behaviors across symmetric observations, producing temporally and spatially coordinated motions with higher task performance. Extensive experiments on velocity tracking tasks, conducted in both simulation and real-world deployment with the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrate that SE-Policy improves tracking accuracy by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while achieving superior spatial-temporal coordination. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SE-Policy and its broad applicability to humanoid robots.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 accepted |

Effective control of robots in these tasks requires managing the energy level in the closed-loop systems to prevent potential dangers while also minimizing motion errors to complete the shared tasks. The collaborative tasks pose numerous challenges due to varied human intentions in adapting to workspace characteristics, leading to human-robot conflicts. In this paper, we develop a cooperation control framework for human-robot co-carrying tasks constructed by utilizing reference generator and low-level controller to aim to achieve safe interaction and synchronized human-robot movement. Firstly, the human motion predictions are corrected in the event of prediction errors based on the conflicts measured by the interaction forces through admittance control, thereby mitigating conflict levels. Low-level controller using an energy-compensation passive velocity field control approach allows encoding the corrected motion to produce control torques for the robot. In this manner, the closed-loop robotic system is passive when the energy level exceeds the predetermined threshold, and otherwise. Furthermore, the proposed control approach ensures that the system's kinetic energy is compensated within a finite time interval. The passivity, stability, convergence rate of energy, and power flow regulation are analyzed from theoretical viewpoints. Human-in-the-loop experiments involving 18 participants have demonstrated that the proposed method significantly enhances task performance and reduces human workload, as evidenced by both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, with improvements confirmed by statistical tests (p < 0.05) relative to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures.

Scree habitats, hosting unique and often endangered species, face severe threats from climate change due to their high-altitude nature. Traditionally, their monitoring has required highly skilled scientists to conduct extensive fieldwork in remote, potentially hazardous locations, making the process resource-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel approach for scree habitat monitoring using a legged robot to assist botanists in data collection and species identification. Specifically, we deployed the ANYmal C robot in the Italian Alpine bio-region in two field campaigns spanning two years and leveraged deep learning to detect and classify key plant species of interest. Our results demonstrate that agile legged robots can navigate challenging terrains and increase the frequency and efficiency of scree monitoring. When paired with traditional phytosociological surveys performed by botanists, this robotics-assisted protocol not only streamlines field operations but also enhances data acquisition, storage, and usage. The outcomes of this research contribute to the evolving landscape of robotics in environmental science, paving the way for a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to habitat monitoring and preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as Early Access in IEEE Transactions on Field Robotics. 19 pages, 13 figures</p></details> |

Achieving these capabilities requires a cohesive understanding of the environment, including object recognition to localize target objects, object affordances to identify potential interaction areas and spatial affordances to discern optimal areas for both object placement and robot movement. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level task planning and scene understanding, they often struggle to infer actionable positions for physical interaction, such as functional grasping points and permissible placement regions. This limitation stems from the lack of fine-grained annotations for object and spatial affordances in their training datasets. To tackle this challenge, we introduce RoboAfford++, a generative AI-enhanced dataset for multimodal affordance learning for both robotic manipulation and navigation. Our dataset comprises 869,987 images paired with 2.0 million question answering (QA) annotations, covering three critical tasks: object affordance recognition to identify target objects based on attributes and spatial relationships, object affordance prediction to pinpoint functional parts for manipulation, and spatial affordance localization to identify free space for object placement and robot navigation. Complementing this dataset, we propose RoboAfford-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing affordance-aware prediction in real-world scenarios, featuring 338 meticulously annotated samples across the same three tasks. Extensive experimental results reveal the deficiencies of existing VLMs in affordance learning, while fine-tuning on the RoboAfford++ dataset significantly enhances their ability to reason about object and spatial affordances, validating the dataset's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

EnerVerse employs a chunk-wise autoregressive video diffusion framework to predict future embodied spaces from instructions, enhanced by a sparse context memory for long-term reasoning. To model the 3D robotics world, we adopt a multi-view video representation, providing rich perspectives to address challenges like motion ambiguity and 3D grounding. Additionally, EnerVerse-D, a data engine pipeline combining generative modeling with 4D Gaussian Splatting, forms a self-reinforcing data loop to reduce the sim-to-real gap.

However, traditional teleoperation systems rely on inverse kinematics (IK) solvers and hand-tuned PD controllers, which struggle to handle external forces, adapt to different users, and produce natural motions under dynamic conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based neural teleoperation framework that replaces the conventional IK+PD pipeline with learned policies trained via reinforcement learning. Our approach learns to directly map VR controller inputs to robot joint commands while implicitly handling force disturbances, producing smooth trajectories, and adapting to user preferences. We train our policies in simulation using demonstrations collected from IK-based teleoperation as initialization, then fine-tune them with force randomization and trajectory smoothness rewards. Experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that our learned policies achieve 34% lower tracking error, 45% smoother motions, and superior force adaptation compared to the IK baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (50Hz control frequency). We validate our approach on manipulation tasks including object pick-and-place, door opening, and bimanual coordination. These results suggest that learning-based approaches can significantly improve the naturalness and robustness of humanoid teleoperation systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

This paper evaluates Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) combined with Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) on the MetaWorld ML10 benchmark, a challenging suite of ten diverse robotic manipulation tasks. We implement and analyze MAML-TRPO's ability to learn a universal initialization that facilitates few-shot adaptation across semantically different manipulation behaviors including pushing, picking, and drawer manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that MAML achieves effective one-shot adaptation with clear performance improvements after a single gradient update, reaching final success rates of 21.0% on training tasks and 13.2% on held-out test tasks. However, we observe a generalization gap that emerges during meta-training, where performance on test tasks plateaus while training task performance continues to improve. Task-level analysis reveals high variance in adaptation effectiveness, with success rates ranging from 0% to 80% across different manipulation skills. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of gradient-based meta-learning for diverse robotic manipulation, and suggest directions for future work in task-aware adaptation and structured policy architectures.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, employing large robot fleets in manufacturing requires addressing challenges including collision-free movement in a shared workspace, effective multi-robot collaboration to manipulate and transport large payloads, complex task allocation due to coupled manufacturing processes, and spatial planning for parallel assembly and transportation of nested subassemblies. We propose a full algorithmic stack for large-scale multi-robot assembly planning that addresses these challenges and can synthesize construction plans for complex assemblies with thousands of parts in a matter of minutes. Our approach takes in a CAD-like product specification and automatically plans a full-stack assembly procedure for a group of robots to manufacture the product. We propose an algorithmic stack that comprises: (i) an iterative radial layout optimization procedure to define a global staging layout for the manufacturing facility, (ii) a graph-repair mixed-integer program formulation and a modified greedy task allocation algorithm to optimally allocate robots and robot sub-teams to assembly and transport tasks, (iii) a geometric heuristic and a hill-climbing algorithm to plan collaborative carrying configurations of robot sub-teams, and (iv) a distributed control policy that enables robots to execute the assembly motion plan collision-free. We also present an open-source multi-robot manufacturing simulator implemented in Julia as a resource to the research community, to test our algorithms and to facilitate multi-robot manufacturing research more broadly. Our empirical results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach by generating plans to manufacture a LEGO model of a Saturn V launch vehicle with 1845 parts, 306 subassemblies, and 250 robots in under three minutes on a standard laptop computer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repos...</summary><p>Repository: https://github.com/sisl/ConstructionBots.jl</p></details> |
| **[AI-Driven Robotics for Optics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17985v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optics is foundational to research in many areas of science and engineering, including nanophotonics, quantum information, materials science, biomedical imaging, and metrology. However, the design, assembly, and alignment of optical experiments remain predominantly manual, limiting throughput and reproducibility. Automating such experiments is challenging due to the strict, non-negotiable precision requirements and the diversity of optical configurations found in typical laboratories. Here, we introduce a platform that integrates generative artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics to automate free-space optical experiments. The platform translates user-defined goals into valid optical configurations, assembles them using a robotic arm, and performs micrometer-scale fine alignment using a robot-deployable tool. It then executes a range of automated measurements, including beam characterization, polarization mapping, and spectroscopy, with consistency surpassing that of human operators. This work demonstrates the first flexible, AI-driven automation platform for optics, offering a path towards remote operation, cloud labs, and high-throughput discovery in the optical sciences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intermittent Rendezvous Plans with Mixed Integer Linear Program for Large-Scale Multi-Robot Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12237v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Robot Exploration (MRE) systems with communication constraints have proven efficient in accomplishing a variety of tasks, including search-and-rescue, stealth, and military operations. While some works focus on opportunistic approaches for efficiency, others concentrate on pre-planned trajectories or scheduling for increased interpretability. However, scheduling usually requires knowledge of the environment beforehand, which prevents its deployment in several domains due to related uncertainties (e.g., underwater exploration). In our previous work, we proposed an intermittent communications framework for MRE under communication constraints that uses scheduled rendezvous events to mitigate such limitations. However, the system was unable to generate optimal plans and had no mechanisms to follow the plan considering realistic trajectories, which is not suited for real-world deployments. In this work, we further investigate the problem by formulating the Multi-Robot Exploration with Communication Constraints and Intermittent Connectivity (MRE-CCIC) problem. We propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation to generate rendezvous plans and a policy to follow them based on the Rendezvous Tracking for Unknown Scenarios (RTUS) mechanism. The RTUS is a simple rule to allow robots to follow the assigned plan, considering unknown conditions. Finally, we evaluated our method in a large-scale environment configured in Gazebo simulations. The results suggest that our method can follow the plan promptly and accomplish the task efficiently. We provide an open-source implementation of both the MILP plan generator and the large-scale MRE-CCIC.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, International Conference on Advanced Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Innovative Design of Multi-functional Supernumerary Robotic Limbs with Ellipsoid Workspace Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12186v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supernumerary robotic limbs (SRLs) offer substantial potential in both the rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients and the enhancement of functional capabilities for healthy individuals. Designing a general-purpose SRL device is inherently challenging, particularly when developing a unified theoretical framework that meets the diverse functional requirements of both upper and lower limbs. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective optimization (MOO) design theory that integrates grasping workspace similarity, walking workspace similarity, braced force for sit-to-stand (STS) movements, and overall mass and inertia. A geometric vector quantification method is developed using an ellipsoid to represent the workspace, aiming to reduce computational complexity and address quantification challenges. The ellipsoid envelope transforms workspace points into ellipsoid attributes, providing a parametric description of the workspace. Furthermore, the STS static braced force assesses the effectiveness of force transmission. The overall mass and inertia restricts excessive link length. To facilitate rapid and stable convergence of the model to high-dimensional irregular Pareto fronts, we introduce a multi-subpopulation correction firefly algorithm. This algorithm incorporates a strategy involving attractive and repulsive domains to effectively handle the MOO task. The optimized solution is utilized to redesign the prototype for experimentation to meet specified requirements. Six healthy participants and two hemiplegia patients participated in real experiments. Compared to the pre-optimization results, the average grasp success rate improved by 7.2%, while the muscle activity during walking and STS tasks decreased by an average of 12.7% and 25.1%, respectively. The proposed design theory offers an efficient option for the design of multi-functional SRL mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variable Impedance Control for Floating-Base Supernumerary Robotic Leg in Walking Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12184v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In human-robot systems, ensuring safety during force control in the presence of both internal and external disturbances is crucial. As a typical loosely coupled floating-base robot system, the supernumerary robotic leg (SRL) system is particularly susceptible to strong internal disturbances. To address the challenge posed by floating base, we investigated the dynamics model of the loosely coupled SRL and designed a hybrid position/force impedance controller to fit dynamic torque input. An efficient variable impedance control (VIC) method is developed to enhance human-robot interaction, particularly in scenarios involving external force disturbances. By dynamically adjusting impedance parameters, VIC improves the dynamic switching between rigidity and flexibility, so that it can adapt to unknown environmental disturbances in different states. An efficient real-time stability guaranteed impedance parameters generating network is specifically designed for the proposed SRL, to achieve shock mitigation and high rigidity supporting. Simulations and experiments validate the system's effectiveness, demonstrating its ability to maintain smooth signal transitions in flexible states while providing strong support forces in rigid states. This approach provides a practical solution for accommodating individual gait variations in interaction, and significantly advances the safety and adaptability of human-robot systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Whole-Body Control Framework for Humanoid Robots with Heavy Limbs: A Model-Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14278v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots often face significant balance issues due to the motion of their heavy limbs. These challenges are particularly pronounced when attempting dynamic motion or operating in environments with irregular terrain. To address this challenge, this manuscript proposes a whole-body control framework for humanoid robots with heavy limbs, using a model-based approach that combines a kino-dynamics planner and a hierarchical optimization problem. The kino-dynamics planner is designed as a model predictive control (MPC) scheme to account for the impact of heavy limbs on mass and inertia distribution. By simplifying the robot's system dynamics and constraints, the planner enables real-time planning of motion and contact forces. The hierarchical optimization problem is formulated using Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP) to minimize limb control errors and ensure compliance with the policy generated by the kino-dynamics planner. Experimental validation of the proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness. The humanoid robot with heavy limbs controlled by the proposed framework can achieve dynamic walking speeds of up to 1.2~m/s, respond to external disturbances of up to 60~N, and maintain balance on challenging terrains such as uneven surfaces, and outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Obstacle-Avoiding Control of Planar Snake Robots Exploring Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12148v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to develop a resource-efficient solution for obstacle-avoiding tracking control of a planar snake robot in a densely cluttered environment with obstacles. Particularly, Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) has been employed to generate dynamic gait parameters for the serpenoid gait function, which is implemented on the joint angles of the snake robot, thus controlling the robot on a desired dynamic path. NEAT is a single neural-network based evolutionary algorithm that is known to work extremely well when the input layer is of significantly higher dimension and the output layer is of a smaller size. For the planar snake robot, the input layer consists of the joint angles, link positions, head link position as well as obstacle positions in the vicinity. However, the output layer consists of only the frequency and offset angle of the serpenoid gait that control the speed and heading of the robot, respectively. Obstacle data from a LiDAR and the robot data from various sensors, along with the location of the end goal and time, are employed to parametrize a reward function that is maximized over iterations by selective propagation of superior neural networks. The implementation and experimental results showcase that the proposed approach is computationally efficient, especially for large environments with many obstacles. The proposed framework has been verified through a physics engine simulation study on PyBullet. The approach shows superior results to existing state-of-the-art methodologies and comparable results to the very recent CBRL approach with significantly lower computational overhead.

However, recent research has raised concerns about the potential for LLMs to produce discriminatory outcomes and unsafe behaviors in real-world robot experiments and applications. To assess whether such concerns are well placed in the context of HRI, we evaluate several highly-rated LLMs on discrimination and safety criteria. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs are currently unsafe for people across a diverse range of protected identity characteristics, including, but not limited to, race, gender, disability status, nationality, religion, and their intersections. Concretely, we show that LLMs produce directly discriminatory outcomes- e.g., 'gypsy' and 'mute' people are labeled untrustworthy, but not 'european' or 'able-bodied' people. We find various such examples of direct discrimination on HRI tasks such as facial expression, proxemics, security, rescue, and task assignment. Furthermore, we test models in settings with unconstrained natural language (open vocabulary) inputs, and find they fail to act safely, generating responses that accept dangerous, violent, or unlawful instructions-such as incident-causing misstatements, taking people's mobility aids, and sexual predation. Our results underscore the urgent need for systematic, routine, and comprehensive risk assessments and assurances to improve outcomes and ensure LLMs only operate on robots when it is safe, effective, and just to do so. We provide code to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/rumaisa-azeem/llm-robots-discrimination-safety .</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in International Journal of Social Robotics (2025). 49 pages (65 with references and appendix), 27 Figures, 8 Tables.

| **[Human2Robot: Learning Robot Actions from Paired Human-Robot Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16587v4)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilling knowledge from human demonstrations is a promising way for robots to learn and act. Existing methods, which often rely on coarsely-aligned video pairs, are typically constrained to learning global or task-level features. As a result, they tend to neglect the fine-grained frame-level dynamics required for complex manipulation and generalization to novel tasks. We posit that this limitation stems from a vicious circle of inadequate datasets and the methods they inspire. To break this cycle, we propose a paradigm shift that treats fine-grained human-robot alignment as a conditional video generation problem. To this end, we first introduce H&R, a novel third-person dataset containing 2,600 episodes of precisely synchronized human and robot motions, collected using a VR teleoperation system. We then present Human2Robot, a framework designed to leverage this data. Human2Robot employs a Video Prediction Model to learn a rich and implicit representation of robot dynamics by generating robot videos from human input, which in turn guides a decoupled action decoder. Our real-world experiments demonstrate that this approach not only achieves high performance on seen tasks but also exhibits significant one-shot generalization to novel positions, objects, instances, and even new task categories.</p></details> |  |

Conventional wheeled or legged robots often struggle in these contexts due to surface variability. This paper presents ARCSnake V2, an amphibious, screw propelled, snake like robot designed for teleoperated or autonomous locomotion across land, granular media, and aquatic environments. ARCSnake V2 combines the high mobility of hyper redundant snake robots with the terrain versatility of Archimedean screw propulsion. Key contributions include a water sealed mechanical design with serially linked screw and joint actuation, an integrated buoyancy control system, and teleoperation via a kinematically matched handheld controller. The robots design and control architecture enable multiple locomotion modes screwing, wheeling, and sidewinding with smooth transitions between them. Extensive experiments validate its underwater maneuverability, communication robustness, and force regulated actuation. These capabilities position ARCSnake V2 as a versatile platform for exploration, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring in multi domain settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, ICRA</p></details> |
| **[GUIDES: Guidance Using Instructor-Distilled Embeddings for Pre-trained Robot Policy Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03400v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained robot policies serve as the foundation of many validated robotic systems, which encapsulate extensive embodied knowledge. However, they often lack the semantic awareness characteristic of foundation models, and replacing them entirely is impractical in many situations due to high costs and the loss of accumulated knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a lightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance from foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs a fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual instructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance embeddings. These embeddings are injected into the policy's latent space, allowing the legacy model to adapt to this new semantic input through brief, targeted fine-tuning. For inference-time robustness, a large language model-based Reflector monitors the Instructor's confidence and, when confidence is low, initiates a reasoning loop that analyzes execution history, retrieves relevant examples, and augments the VLM's context to refine subsequent actions. Extensive validation in the RoboCasa simulation environment across diverse policy architectures shows consistent and substantial improvements in task success rates. Real-world deployment on a UR5 robot further demonstrates that GUIDES enhances motion precision for critical sub-tasks such as grasping. Overall, GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade, rather than replace, validated robot policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, Accepted by IEEE IROS 2025 Workshop WIR-M</p></details> |

In reliance on these state augmentations, delay-resolved reinforcement learning algorithms train policies to learn optimal interactions with environments featuring observation or action delays. Although such methods can be directly trained on the real robots, due to sample inefficiency, limited resources, or safety constraints, a common approach is to transfer models trained in simulation to the physical robot. However, robotic simulations rely on approximated models of the physical systems, which hinders the sim2real transfer. In this work, we consider various uncertainties in modeling the robot or environment dynamics as unknown intrinsic disturbances applied to the system input. We introduce the disturbance-augmented Markov decision process (DAMDP) in delayed settings as a novel representation to incorporate disturbance estimation in training on-policy reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed method is validated across several metrics on learning robotic reaching and pushing tasks and compared with disturbance-unaware baselines. The results show that the disturbance-augmented models can achieve higher stabilization and robustness in the control response, which in turn improves the prospects of successful sim2real transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology (TCST)</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Sparsity: Challenging Common Sparsity Assumptions for Learning World Models in Robotic Reinforcement Learning Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08086v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of learned dynamics models, also known as world models, can improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning. Recent work suggests that the underlying causal graphs of such dynamics models are sparsely connected, with each of the future state variables depending only on a small subset of the current state variables, and that learning may therefore benefit from sparsity priors. Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias. In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks. We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely. Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions. These findings challenge common sparsity prior assumptions in dynamics learning, emphasizing the need for grounded inductive biases that reflect the state-dependent sparsity structure of real-world dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconfigurable hydrostatics: Toward versatile and efficient load-bearing robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17936v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable and legged robot designers face multiple challenges when choosing actuation. Traditional fully actuated designs using electric motors are multifunctional but oversized and inefficient for bearing conservative loads and for being backdrivable. Alternatively, quasi-passive and underactuated designs reduce the amount of motorization and energy storage, but are often designed for specific tasks. Designers of versatile and stronger wearable robots will face these challenges unless future actuators become very torque-dense, backdrivable and efficient This paper explores a design paradigm for addressing this issue: reconfigurable hydrostatics. We show that a hydrostatic actuator can integrate a passive force mechanism and a sharing mechanism in the fluid domain and still be multifunctional. First, an analytical study compares the effect of these two mechanisms on the motorization requirements in the context of a load-bearing exoskeleton. Then, the hydrostatic concept integrating these two mechanisms using hydraulic components is presented. A case study analysis shows the mass/efficiency/inertia benefits of the concept over a fully actuated one. Then, experiments are conducted on robotic legs to demonstrate that the actuator concept can meet the expected performance in terms of force tracking, versatility, and efficiency under controlled conditions. The proof-of-concept can track the vertical ground reaction force (GRF) profiles of walking, running, squatting, and jumping, and the energy consumption is 4.8x lower for walking. The transient force behaviors due to switching from one leg to the other are also analyzed along with some mitigation to improve them.</p></details> |  |
