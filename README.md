| **[Multimodal Spatial Reasoning in the Large Model Era: A Survey and Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25760v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However, systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space. We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated information about this survey, codes and implementation of the open benchmarks can be found at https://github.com/zhengxuJosh/Awesome-Spatial-Reasoning.</p></details> |  |

While transferring into hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[SceneWeaver: All-in-One 3D Scene Synthesis with an Extensible and Self-Reflective Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20414v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

| **[Two-Steps Diffusion Policy for Robotic Manipulation via Genetic Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21991v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, such as diffusion policy, have achieved state-of-the-art results in robotic manipulation by imitating expert demonstrations. While diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and video generation, many of their inference strategies have been directly transferred to control domains without adaptation. In this work, we show that by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied AI tasks -- particularly structured, low-dimensional nature of action distributions -- diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as 5 neural function evaluations (NFE). Building on this insight, we propose a population-based sampling strategy, genetic denoising, which enhances both performance and stability by selecting denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk. Our method solves challenging tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. We evaluate our approach across 14 robotic manipulation tasks from D4RL and Robomimic, spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets. In over 2 million evaluations, our method consistently outperforms standard diffusion-based policies, achieving up to 20\% performance gains with significantly fewer inference steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figure, 2 tables, accepted at Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[MEReQ: Max-Ent Residual-Q Inverse RL for Sample-Efficient Alignment from Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16258v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning robot behavior with human preferences is crucial for deploying embodied AI agents in human-centered environments. A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmbodiedBrain: Expanding Performance Boundaries of Task Planning for Embodied Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20578v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model (GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency. For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks, highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data, model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at https://zterobot.github.io/EmbodiedBrain.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05341v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://directlayout.github.io/</p></details> |

World simulators provide such environments but face distinct limitations: video-based methods generate diverse content but lack real-time physics feedback for interactive learning, while physics-based engines provide accurate dynamics but face scalability limitations from costly manual asset creation. We present Seed3D 1.0, a foundation model that generates simulation-ready 3D assets from single images, addressing the scalability challenge while maintaining physics rigor. Unlike existing 3D generation models, our system produces assets with accurate geometry, well-aligned textures, and realistic physically-based materials. These assets can be directly integrated into physics engines with minimal configuration, enabling deployment in robotic manipulation and simulation training. Beyond individual objects, the system scales to complete scene generation through assembling objects into coherent environments. By enabling scalable simulation-ready content creation, Seed3D 1.0 provides a foundation for advancing physics-based world simulators. Seed3D 1.0 is now available on https://console.volcengine.com/ark/region:ark+cn-beijing/experience/vision?modelId=doubao-seed3d-1-0-250928&tab=Gen3D</p></details> | <details><summary>Seed3...</summary><p>Seed3D 1.0 Technical Report; Official Page on https://seed.bytedance.com/seed3d</p></details> |
| **[Seeing Across Views: Benchmarking Spatial Reasoning of Vision-Language Models in Robotic Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19400v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project and benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/MV-RoboBench</p></details> |
| **[Seeing through Uncertainty: Robust Task-Oriented Optimization in Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00441v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual navigation is a fundamental problem in embodied AI, yet practical deployments demand long-horizon planning capabilities to address multi-objective tasks. A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned from limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural network-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that paradoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper introduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization. Specifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it transforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal calibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii) it reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization problem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments. Extensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation tasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in generalization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIKI-R: Coordinating Embodied Multi-Agent Cooperation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09049v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://faceong.github.io/VIKI-R/</p></details> |
| **[3D Audio-Visual Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02236v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing the sounding objects in scenes is a longstanding objective in embodied AI, with diverse applications in robotics and AR/VR/MR. To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

| **[Bridging Embodiment Gaps: Deploying Vision-Language-Action Models on Soft Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17369v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic systems are increasingly expected to operate in human-centered, unstructured environments where safety, adaptability, and generalization are essential. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been proposed as a language guided generalized control framework for real robots. However, their deployment has been limited to conventional serial link manipulators. Coupled by their rigidity and unpredictability of learning based control, the ability to safely interact with the environment is missing yet critical. In this work, we present the deployment of a VLA model on a soft continuum manipulator to demonstrate autonomous safe human-robot interaction. We present a structured finetuning and deployment pipeline evaluating two state-of-the-art VLA models (OpenVLA-OFT and $\pi_0$) across representative manipulation tasks, and show while out-of-the-box policies fail due to embodiment mismatch, through targeted finetuning the soft robot performs equally to the rigid counterpart. Our findings highlight the necessity of finetuning for bridging embodiment gaps, and demonstrate that coupling VLA models with soft robots enables safe and flexible embodied AI in human-shared environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 SpaVLE workshop. 4 pages, 2 figures(in main paper, excluding references and supplements)</p></details> |
| **[DeepSeek-Inspired Exploration of RL-based LLMs and Synergy with Wireless Networks: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09956v4)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL)-based large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, have attracted widespread attention for their remarkable capabilities in multimodal data understanding. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has led to a growing demand for AI-enabled wireless networks. The open-source DeepSeek models are famous for their innovative designs, such as large-scale pure RL and cost-efficient training, which make them well-suited for practical deployment in wireless networks. By integrating DeepSeek-style LLMs with wireless infrastructures, a synergistic opportunity arises: the DeepSeek-style LLMs enhance network optimization with strong reasoning and decision-making abilities, while wireless infrastructure enables the broad deployment of these models. Motivated by this convergence, this survey presents a comprehensive DeepSeek-inspired exploration of RL-based LLMs in the context of wireless networks. We begin by reviewing key techniques behind network optimization to establish a foundation for understanding DeepSeek-style LLM integration. Next, we examine recent advancements in RL-based LLMs, using DeepSeek models as a representative example. Building on this, we explore the synergy between the two domains, highlighting motivations, challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we highlight emerging directions for integrating LLMs with wireless networks, such as quantum, on-device, and neural-symbolic LLM models, as well as embodied AI agents. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive examination of the interplay between DeepSeek-style LLMs and wireless networks, demonstrating how these domains can mutually enhance each other to drive innovation.</p></details> | 45 pages, 12 figures |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on World Models for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16732v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI requires agents that perceive, act, and anticipate how actions reshape future world states. World models serve as internal simulators that capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2) Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges, including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal consistency while mitigating error accumulation.

| **[Elevating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs with Visual Embedding Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09585v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, the standard practice for developing MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/visper_lm/</p></details> |

Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware, interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art.

This paper proposes a novel framework, named SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> |
| **[ERA: Transforming VLMs into Embodied Agents via Embodied Prior Learning and Online Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12693v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2) Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of 8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen tasks.

| **[Image Quality Assessment for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16815v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI has developed rapidly in recent years, but it is still mainly deployed in laboratories, with various distortions in the Real-world limiting its application. Traditionally, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are applied to predict human preferences for distorted images; however, there is no IQA method to assess the usability of an image in embodied tasks, namely, the perceptual quality for robots. To provide accurate and reliable quality indicators for future embodied scenarios, we first propose the topic: IQA for Embodied AI. Specifically, we (1) based on the Mertonian system and meta-cognitive theory, constructed a perception-cognition-decision-execution pipeline and defined a comprehensive subjective score collection process; (2) established the Embodied-IQA database, containing over 36k reference/distorted image pairs, with more than 5m fine-grained annotations provided by Vision Language Models/Vision Language Action-models/Real-world robots; (3) trained and validated the performance of mainstream IQA methods on Embodied-IQA, demonstrating the need to develop more accurate quality indicators for Embodied AI. We sincerely hope that through evaluation, we can promote the application of Embodied AI under complex distortions in the Real-world.

However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond 'Templates': Category-Agnostic Object Pose, Size, and Shape Estimation from a Single View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11687v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL, spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D understanding in robotics and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy. For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables, NeurIPS 2025 Camera Ready Version (oral)</p></details> |

However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall, our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied tasks.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Although recent advances in simulation platforms have greatly enhanced task diversity to train embodied Vision Language Models (VLMs), most platforms rely on simplified robot morphologies and bypass the stochastic nature of low-level execution, which limits their transferability to real-world robots. To address these issues, we present a physics-based simulation platform DualTHOR for complex dual-arm humanoid robots, built upon an extended version of AI2-THOR. Our simulator includes real-world robot assets, a task suite for dual-arm collaboration, and inverse kinematics solvers for humanoid robots. We also introduce a contingency mechanism that incorporates potential failures through physics-based low-level execution, bridging the gap to real-world scenarios. Our simulator enables a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness and generalization of VLMs in household environments. Extensive evaluations reveal that current VLMs struggle with dual-arm coordination and exhibit limited robustness in realistic environments with contingencies, highlighting the importance of using our simulator to develop more capable VLMs for embodied tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ds199895/DualTHOR.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The experiments in the paper need to be further supplemented, and more methods should be considered for expansion</p></details> |

We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.</p></details> | 6 pages |

A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly triggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions, potentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor attacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on untargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of targeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor attacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such attacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant inference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve attack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal that the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors succeed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger design, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and inference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense against TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream to flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the vulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores the need for more advanced defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 tables, 1 figure.

FormCoach transforms a simple camera into an always-on, interactive AI training partner, capable of spotting subtle form errors and delivering tailored corrections in real time, leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

In a grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop, plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search, belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Unlike previous surveys that often focus on specific modalities or limited fusion strategies, our work presents a structure-centric and method-driven framework that emphasizes generalizable techniques. We systematically categorize and analyze key approaches to alignment and fusion through both structural perspectives -- data-level, feature-level, and output-level fusion -- and methodological paradigms -- including statistical, kernel-based, graphical, generative, contrastive, attention-based, and large language model (LLM)-based methods, drawing insights from an extensive review of over 260 relevant studies. Furthermore, this survey highlights critical challenges such as cross-modal misalignment, computational bottlenecks, data quality issues, and the modality gap, along with recent efforts to address them. Applications ranging from social media analysis and medical imaging to emotion recognition and embodied AI are explored to illustrate the real-world impact of robust multimodal systems. The insights provided aim to guide future research toward optimizing multimodal learning systems for improved scalability, robustness, and generalizability across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCV 2025</p></details> |

For any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs. It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source, specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

This setup enables the study of uncertainty propagation, planning under limited perception, and emergent multi-agent behavior. Experiments in urban scenarios illustrate realistic temporal and spatial patterns while revealing the challenges of belief estimation under sparse observations. By combining structured representations with efficient simulation, FOGMACHINE establishes an effective tool for benchmarking, model training, and advancing embodied AI in complex, uncertain environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the IEEE for possible publication; 8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Goal-oriented Backdoor Attack against Vision-Language-Action Models via Physical Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09269v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have greatly improved embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers. Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions. In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and BadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at https://goba-attack.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTR-Bench: Evaluating Geo-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07791v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

While recent studies leverage visual or textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain. Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise, prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D affordance segmentation.</p></details> | Work in process |

While current learning tools show promise for speaking practice, most focus on dyadic, scripted scenarios, limiting opportunities for dynamic group interactions. To address this gap, we present ConversAR, a Mixed Reality system that leverages Generative AI and XR to support situated and personalized group conversations. It integrates embodied AI agents, scene recognition, and generative 3D props anchored to real-world surroundings. Based on a formative study with experts in language acquisition, we developed and tested this system with a user study with 21 second-language learners. Results indicate that the system enhanced learner engagement, increased willingness to communicate, and offered a safe space for speaking. We discuss the implications for integrating Generative AI and XR into the design of future language learning applications.</p></details> | 22 pages |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in semantic reasoning and task planning, a significant gap persists between their high-level understanding and the precise physical execution required for real-world manipulation. To bridge this "semantic-to-physical" gap, we introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world environments, without requiring task-specific training.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, submitted for ICLR 2026 conference</p></details> |

However, their robustness to natural language variability in real-world scenarios has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a novel systematic study of the robustness of state-of-the-art VLA models under linguistic perturbations. Specifically, we evaluate model performance under two types of instruction noise: (1) human-generated paraphrasing and (2) the addition of irrelevant context. We further categorize irrelevant contexts into two groups according to their length and their semantic and lexical proximity to robot commands. In this study, we observe consistent performance degradation as context size expands. We also demonstrate that the model can exhibit relative robustness to random context, with a performance drop within 10%, while semantically and lexically similar context of the same length can trigger a quality decline of around 50%. Human paraphrases of instructions lead to a drop of nearly 20%. To mitigate this, we propose an LLM-based filtering framework that extracts core commands from noisy inputs. Incorporating our filtering step allows models to recover up to 98.5% of their original performance under noisy conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this context, World Models (WMs) have been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a quantitative evaluation of the results.</p></details> |  |

Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative: they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction, enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation. Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at https://worv-ai.github.io/d2e/</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 17 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

These models have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark, VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation. Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.</p></details> | We are revising it |

Despite the rapid progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation. It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs, mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions, conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, Project Page:https://hyelinnam.github.io/Cameo/</p></details> |

This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making. We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task coordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for iterative system development and demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of UKCI 2025</p></details> |

In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target model and selectively skips communication and computation for server operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model only inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA-R1: Enhancing Reasoning in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01623v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1.

To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust, long-term reasoning and planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CHAI: Command Hijacking against embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00181v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to handle edge cases in robotic vehicle systems where data is scarce by using common-sense reasoning grounded in perception and action to generalize beyond training distributions and adapt to novel real-world situations. These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete. Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models, provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand, advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility, dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are available at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[What Can RL Bring to VLA Generalization? An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

However, existing interactive segmentation methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained, multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new 3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale, scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines, PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, conference</p></details> |

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Embodied Planning with Verifiable Reward for Real-World Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25852v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the planner. We will open-source both the dataset and the trained model upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning with Vision-Language Models in Ego-Centric Multi-View Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06266v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing zero-shot LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions. We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in navigation performance.</p></details> |  |

A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end, with agents generating messages and actions concurrently. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), to simulate future states. Agents then communicate a summary of this plan. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI.

Yet prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge; and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders, suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability. Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time, and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across four public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a poster in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, current co-speech gesture generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (e.g. speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To address this gap, we introduce Intentional-Gesture, a novel framework that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in high-level communicative functions. First, we curate the InG dataset by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (i.e., text sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the Intentional Gesture Motion Tokenizer to leverage these intention annotations. It injects high-level communicative functions (e.g., intentions) into tokenized motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture</p></details> |  |
| **[Can AI Perceive Physical Danger and Intervene?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21651v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent -- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions. The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at https://asimov-benchmark.github.io/v2</p></details> |  |

Interactable digital twins of such objects have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. Unfortunately, current methods to digitize articulated real-world objects require carefully captured data, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable acquisition. We focus on motion analysis and part-level segmentation of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to obtain at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is challenging due to simultaneous object and camera motion and significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iTACO: a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories that is 20$\times$ larger than available in prior work. We then compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Our experiments show that iTACO outperforms existing articulated object digital twin methods on both synthetic and real casually captured RGBD videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website can be found at https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/video2articulation/</p></details> |

Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models (WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building internal representations and future predictions of the external world, facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances, covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e., embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs, meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE CASM</p></details> |

However, deploying such agents in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes. Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards real-world assistive robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plan Verification for LLM-Based Embodied Task Completion Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02761v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions, redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout). The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25 fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view), providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially, we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the leaderboards of Embodied Arena. This helps to establish clear research veins and pinpoint critical research problems, thereby driving forward progress in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, Embodied Arena Technical Report</p></details> |

Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmbodiedSplat: Personalized Real-to-Sim-to-Real Navigation with Gaussian Splats from a Mobile Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17430v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Embodied AI predominantly relies on simulation for training and evaluation, often using either fully synthetic environments that lack photorealism or high-fidelity real-world reconstructions captured with expensive hardware. As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate improvements of 20% and 40% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover, our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87-0.97) for the reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to diverse environments with minimal effort.

| **[Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16176v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories (ACDC), an autonomous drone cinematography system driven by natural language communication between human directors and drones. The main limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent, which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models (VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.</p></details> |  |
| **[OptiScene: LLM-driven Indoor Scene Layout Generation via Scaled Human-aligned Data Synthesis and Multi-Stage Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07570v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emulating Human-like Adaptive Vision for Efficient and Flexible Machine Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15333v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition.

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

To overcome these obstacles, we propose RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pku-epic.github.io/NavFoM-Web/</p></details> |

For example, such knowledge directs an agent to grasp a knife by the handle for cutting or by the blade for safe handover. While existing approaches have made notable progress, affordance research still faces three key challenges: data scarcity, poor generalization, and real-world deployment. Specifically, there is a lack of large-scale affordance datasets with precise segmentation maps, existing models struggle to generalize across different domains or novel object and affordance classes, and little work demonstrates deployability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a complete affordance learning system that (1) takes in egocentric videos and outputs precise affordance annotations without human labeling, (2) leverages geometric information and vision foundation models to improve generalization, and (3) introduces a framework that facilitates affordance-oriented robotic manipulation such as tool grasping and robot-to-human tool handover. Experimental results show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by 13.8% in mIoU, and the framework achieves 77.1% successful grasping among 179 trials, including evaluations on seen, unseen classes, and cluttered scenes.

While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world, incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g., CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for complex, real-world environments.

In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications.

Existing approaches often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought (CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format, understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its robustness under limited onboard resources. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/Nav-R1.

However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |

Traditional sequential computation patterns, while effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by 2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and providing high throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://aopolin-lv.github.io/F1-VLA/</p></details> |

World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity.

| **[Generative World Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: multi-modal multi-task foundation models (M3T-FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas federated learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied AI environments. In this vision paper, we introduce multi-modal multi-task federated foundation models (M3T-FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of M3T-FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed training nature of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical deployment dimensions of M3T-FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning, Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for deploying M3T-FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs. Finally, we present a prototype implementation of M3T-FFMs and evaluate their energy and latency performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in IEEE Internet of Things Magazine, 2025</p></details> |

While existing methods have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication to encourage future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Model Implanting for Test-time Adaptation of Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03956v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models, the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability. In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied AI: Emerging Risks and Opportunities for Policy Action](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00117v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI systems can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. With recent advances in AI models and hardware, EAI systems are becoming increasingly capable across wider operational domains. While EAI systems can offer many benefits, they also pose significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, as well as economic and societal disruption. These risks require urgent attention from policymakers, as existing policies governing industrial robots and autonomous vehicles are insufficient to address the full range of concerns EAI systems present. To help address this issue, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a taxonomy of the physical, informational, economic, and social risks EAI systems pose. Second, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to assess how existing frameworks address these risks and to identify critical gaps. We conclude by offering policy recommendations for the safe and beneficial deployment of EAI systems, such as mandatory testing and certification schemes, clarified liability frameworks, and strategies to manage EAI's potentially transformative economic and societal impacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[ANNIE: Be Careful of Your Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03383v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI) robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety, how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries; (2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with 2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3) ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era.

Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems.

| **[Omnidirectional Spatial Modeling from Correlated Panoramas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02164v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the \textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories (\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[FGO-SLAM: Enhancing Gaussian SLAM with Globally Consistent Opacity Radiance Field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01547v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual SLAM has regained attention due to its ability to provide perceptual capabilities and simulation test data for Embodied AI. However, traditional SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction, and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

| **[Defeating the Training-Inference Mismatch via FP16](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26788v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16 uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A General Incentives-Based Framework for Fairness in Multi-agent Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26740v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the General Incentives-based Framework for Fairness (GIFF), a novel approach for fair multi-agent resource allocation that infers fair decision-making from standard value functions. In resource-constrained settings, agents optimizing for efficiency often create inequitable outcomes. Our approach leverages the action-value (Q-)function to balance efficiency and fairness without requiring additional training. Specifically, our method computes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual advantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off agents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where an arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem. Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing, homelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover far-sighted, equitable policies. The framework's effectiveness is supported by a theoretical foundation; we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower bound on the true fairness improvement and that its trade-off parameter offers monotonic tuning. Our findings establish GIFF as a robust and principled framework for leveraging standard reinforcement learning components to achieve more equitable outcomes in complex multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we employ Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories. This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited data availability.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, RLHF struggles with interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness. RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g. accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24, 2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR) transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical delta rule. We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output lengths. To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model checkpoints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Kimi ...</summary><p>Kimi Linear tech report</p></details> |

Actions are equally fundamental in the modeling of stochastic processes, as they trigger discontinuous state transitions and enable the flow of information through large, complex systems. In this paper, we unify the perspectives of stochastic processes and reinforcement learning through action-driven processes, and illustrate their application to spiking neural networks. Leveraging ideas from control-as-inference, we show that minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a policy-driven true distribution and a reward-driven model distribution for a suitably defined action-driven process is equivalent to maximum entropy reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

To realize this vision, we introduce asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28% lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without additional training.</p></details> |  |

While low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) employed with wireless power transfer (WPT) capabilities offer a promising solution, the line-of-sight channels that facilitate efficient energy delivery also expose sensitive operational data to adversaries. This paper proposes a novel low-altitude UAV-carried movable antenna-enhanced transmission system joint WPT and covert communications, which simultaneously performs energy supplements to IoT nodes and establishes transmission links with a covert user by leveraging wireless energy signals as a natural cover. Then, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that jointly maximizes the total harvested energy of IoT nodes and sum achievable rate of the covert user, while minimizing the propulsion energy consumption of the low-altitude UAV. To address the non-convex and temporally coupled optimization problem, we propose a mixture-of-experts-augmented soft actor-critic (MoE-SAC) algorithm that employs a sparse Top-K gated mixture-of-shallow-experts architecture to represent multimodal policy distributions arising from the conflicting optimization objectives. We also incorporate an action projection module that explicitly enforces per-time-slot power budget constraints and antenna position constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms some baseline approaches and other state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-empowered multi-level jamming approach to enhance the security of SemCom systems over MIMO fading wiretap channels. This approach combines semantic layer jamming, achieved by encoding task-irrelevant text, and physical layer jamming, achieved by encoding random Gaussian noise. These two-level jamming signals are superposed with task-relevant semantic information to protect the transmitted semantics from eavesdropping. A deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is further introduced to dynamically design and optimize the precoding matrices for both taskrelevant semantic information and multi-level jamming signals, aiming to enhance the legitimate user's image reconstruction while degrading the eavesdropper's performance. To jointly train the SemCom model and the DDPG agent, we propose an alternating optimization strategy where the two modules are updated iteratively. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with both the encryption-based (ESCS) and encoded jammer-based (EJ) benchmarks, our method achieves comparable security while improving the legitimate user's peak signalto-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to approximately 0.6 dB.</p></details> |  |

Emu3.5 is pre-trained end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA), which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction, accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance. Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks.

However, its application is often hindered by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards, thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}: injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}: employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to advanced proprietary LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Exploration in Reinforcement Learning using Bounded Uncertainty Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05978v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for decision-making in uncertain environments, but it often requires large amounts of data to learn an optimal policy. We address this challenge by incorporating prior model knowledge to guide exploration and accelerate the learning process. Specifically, we assume access to a model set that contains the true transition kernel and reward function. We optimize over this model set to obtain upper and lower bounds on the Q-function, which are then used to guide the exploration of the agent. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the Q-function to the optimal Q-function under the proposed class of exploring policies. Furthermore, we also introduce a data-driven regularized version of the model set optimization problem that ensures the convergence of the class of exploring policies to the optimal policy. Lastly, we show that when the model set has a specific structure, namely the bounded-parameter MDP (BMDP) framework, the regularized model set optimization problem becomes convex and simple to implement. In this setting, we also prove finite-time convergence to the optimal policy under mild assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed exploration strategy, which we call BUMEX (Bounded Uncertainty Model-based Exploration), in a simulation study. The results indicate that the proposed method can significantly accelerate learning in benchmark examples.

While prevalent test-time scaling approaches are often realized by using external reward models to guide the model generation process, we find that only marginal gains can be acquired when scaling a model post-trained on specific reasoning tasks. We identify that the limited improvement stems from distribution discrepancies between the specific post-trained generator and the general reward model. To address this, we propose a framework that incentivizes LLMs to self-verify their own answers. By unifying answer generation and verification within a single reinforcement learning (RL) process, we train models that can effectively assess the correctness of their own solutions. The trained model can further scale its performance at inference time by verifying its generations, without the need for external verifiers. We train our self-verification models based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, demonstrating their capabilities across varying reasoning context lengths. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our models can not only improve post-training performance but also enable effective test-time scaling.</p></details> |  |

Previous research focuses on training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today. Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate. Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to hand-crafted agents. As a testament to the impact of the approach, the method has been adopted for use in the most recent release of the series.</p></details> |  |
| **[PairUni: Pairwise Training for Unified Multimodal Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25682v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly. We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples, forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Codes are available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/PairUni.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures, and 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Think Outside the Policy: In-Context Steered Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26519v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets. ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR paradigm for LRMs.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Data-Efficient RLVR via Off-Policy Influence Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26491v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based, lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop \textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy \text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy. Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReSpec: Towards Optimizing Speculative Decoding in Reinforcement Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26475v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy degradation. To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations, evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.</p></details> |  |

This work investigates kernel construction under recursive maximum likelihood decoding (RMLD) using a reinforcement learning framework based on the Gumbel AlphaZero algorithm. The proposed method efficiently explores the design space and identifies large-size kernels that satisfy a given error exponent while minimizing decoding complexity. For a size-16 kernel, it achieves 17% lower decoding complexity than handcrafted designs while reaching an error exponent of 0.5183 compared to 0.5 for Arikan's kernel, demonstrating the effectiveness of the learning-based approach for practical polar code construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-in-the-loop Online Rejection Sampling for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26406v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic manipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with RL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at intermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but often underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose Hi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during online fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective to provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we develop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible online human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for learning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by reliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better performance.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Adaptive Context Length Optimization with Low-Frequency Truncation for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26389v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football (GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reinforcement Learning Based Log Loading Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26363v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forestry forwarders play a central role in mechanized timber harvesting by picking up and moving logs from the felling site to a processing area or a secondary transport vehicle. Forwarder operation is challenging and physically and mentally exhausting for the operator who must control the machine in remote areas for prolonged periods of time. Therefore, even partial automation of the process may reduce stress on the operator. This study focuses on continuing previous research efforts in application of reinforcement learning agents in automating log handling process, extending the task from grasping which was studied in previous research to full log loading operation. The resulting agent will be capable to automate a full loading procedure from locating and grappling to transporting and delivering the log to a forestry forwarder bed. To train the agent, a trailer type forestry forwarder simulation model in NVIDIA's Isaac Gym and a virtual environment for a typical log loading scenario were developed. With reinforcement learning agents and a curriculum learning approach, the trained agent may be a stepping stone towards application of reinforcement learning agents in automation of the forestry forwarder. The agent learnt grasping a log in a random position from grapple's random position and transport it to the bed with 94% success rate of the best performing agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Pollution Detection in a Randomized, Sparse and Nonstationary Environment with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26347v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward. This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning, and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and reward-sparse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Clustering of Preference Learning with Active-data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26301v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover, real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences. For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm, A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRPO-Guard: Mitigating Implicit Over-Optimization in Flow Matching via Regulated Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22319v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions, preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g., SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jingw193.github.io/GRPO-Guard/</p></details> |

In this work, we propose Oryx, a novel algorithm for offline cooperative MARL to directly address this challenge. Oryx adapts the recently proposed retention-based architecture Sable and combines it with a sequential form of implicit constraint Q-learning (ICQ), to develop a novel offline autoregressive policy update scheme. This allows Oryx to solve complex coordination challenges while maintaining temporal coherence over long trajectories. We evaluate Oryx across a diverse set of benchmarks from prior works -- SMAC, RWARE, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo -- covering tasks of both discrete and continuous control, varying in scale and difficulty. Oryx achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than 80% of the 65 tested datasets, outperforming prior offline MARL methods and demonstrating robust generalisation across domains with many agents and long horizons. Finally, we introduce new datasets to push the limits of many-agent coordination in offline MARL, and demonstrate Oryx's superior ability to scale effectively in such settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Empowering RepoQA-Agent based on Reinforcement Learning Driven by Monte-carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26287v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level software engineering tasks require large language models (LLMs) to efficiently navigate and extract information from complex codebases through multi-turn tool interactions. Existing approaches face significant limitations: training-free, in-context learning methods struggle to guide agents effectively in tool utilization and decision-making based on environmental feedback, while training-based approaches typically rely on costly distillation from larger LLMs, introducing data compliance concerns in enterprise environments. To address these challenges, we introduce RepoSearch-R1, a novel agentic reinforcement learning framework driven by Monte-carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This approach allows agents to generate diverse, high-quality reasoning trajectories via self-training without requiring model distillation or external supervision. Based on RepoSearch-R1, we construct a RepoQA-Agent specifically designed for repository question-answering tasks. Comprehensive evaluation on repository question-answering tasks demonstrates that RepoSearch-R1 achieves substantial improvements of answer completeness: 16.0% enhancement over no-retrieval methods, 19.5% improvement over iterative retrieval methods, and 33% increase in training efficiency compared to general agentic reinforcement learning approaches. Our cold-start training methodology eliminates data compliance concerns while maintaining robust exploration diversity and answer completeness across repository-level reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, enabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such conditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a humanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich environments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like responses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional challenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning architecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each component shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its parameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially outperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot achieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body weight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing improvements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the best-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack (130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight Thor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Yet, when applied to train multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient, unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust, generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review as a conference paper</p></details> |

However, the learning algorithms in CBRL have not been thoroughly developed in previous studies, nor have they incorporated recent advances in reinforcement learning. This study introduced Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3), which is one of the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms that can treat deterministic and continuous action spaces, to CBRL. The validation results provide several insights. First, TD3 works as a learning algorithm for CBRL in a simple goal-reaching task. Second, CBRL agents with TD3 can autonomously suppress their exploratory behavior as learning progresses and resume exploration when the environment changes. Finally, examining the effect of the agent's chaoticity on learning shows that there exists a suitable range of chaos strength in the agent's model to flexibly switch between exploration and exploitation and adapt to environmental changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Neural Networks</p></details> |

However, existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based multi-task methods can only train light decoder models on small-scale problems, exhibiting limited generalization ability when solving large-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel multi-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which enables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong generalization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge from multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder model, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's generalization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a flexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C), which is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the performance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10 unseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Self-Evolving Curriculum for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14970v4)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning Framework for Collaborative Public Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26184v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources, including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of individual resources independently, without considering their capacity constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold: 1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our source codes are available in the supplementary materials.</p></details> |  |

Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model checkpoints to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Manage Investment Portfolios beyond Simple Utility Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26165v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While investment funds publicly disclose their objectives in broad terms, their managers optimize for complex combinations of competing goals that go beyond simple risk-return trade-offs. Traditional approaches attempt to model this through multi-objective utility functions, but face fundamental challenges in specification and parameterization. We propose a generative framework that learns latent representations of fund manager strategies without requiring explicit utility specification. Our approach directly models the conditional probability of a fund's portfolio weights, given stock characteristics, historical returns, previous weights, and a latent variable representing the fund's strategy. Unlike methods based on reinforcement learning or imitation learning, which require specified rewards or labeled expert objectives, our GAN-based architecture learns directly from the joint distribution of observed holdings and market data. We validate our framework on a dataset of 1436 U.S. equity mutual funds. The learned representations successfully capture known investment styles, such as "growth" and "value," while also revealing implicit manager objectives. For instance, we find that while many funds exhibit characteristics of Markowitz-like optimization, they do so with heterogeneous realizations for turnover, concentration, and latent factors. To analyze and interpret the end-to-end model, we develop a series of tests that explain the model, and we show that the benchmark's expert labeling are contained in our model's encoding in a linear interpretable way. Our framework provides a data-driven approach for characterizing investment strategies for applications in market simulation, strategy attribution, and regulatory oversight.</p></details> | <details><summary>6th A...</summary><p>6th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance, November 15-18, 2025, Singapore</p></details> |

We propose Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic, requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks. Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go, aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data. However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback (e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.</p></details> | 29 pages, 4 figures |

To study this, we introduce EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: \url{https://minjoong507.github.io/projects/EgoExo-Con/}</p></details> |
| **[Pass@K Policy Optimization: Solving Harder Reinforcement Learning Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15201v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms sample multiple n>1 solution attempts for each problem and reward them independently. This optimizes for pass@1 performance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of the diversity and collective utility of sets of samples. This under-utilizes the sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder examples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO), a transformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of pass@k performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward when considered jointly. Our contribution is to derive novel low variance unbiased estimators for pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and continuous reward settings. We show optimization with our estimators reduces to standard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and efficient transformation function. While previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable robust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k <= n. Moreover, instead of trading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k during training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1 numbers alongside significant pass@k gains. We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the variance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world examples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation effectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable solving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and pass@k . Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1 optimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely due to better exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Not Step Into the Same River Twice: Learning to Reason from Trial and Error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26109v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently. However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and exploration during training.</p></details> | Work in progress |

We hypothesize this gap stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address. By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding, knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux, IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Learning Approach to Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00227v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a unified framework for analyzing games in greater depth. In the existing literature, players' strategies are typically assigned scalar values, and equilibrium concepts are used to identify compatible choices. However, this approach neglects the internal structure of players, thereby failing to accurately model observed behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose an abstract definition of a player, consistent with constructions in reinforcement learning. Instead of defining games as external settings, our framework defines them in terms of the players themselves. This offers a language that enables a deeper connection between games and learning. To illustrate the need for this generality, we study a simple two-player game and show that even in basic settings, a sophisticated player may adopt dynamic strategies that cannot be captured by simpler models or compatibility analysis. For a general definition of a player, we discuss natural conditions on its components and define competition through their behavior. In the discrete setting, we consider players whose estimates largely follow the standard framework from the literature. We explore connections to correlated equilibrium and highlight that dynamic programming naturally applies to all estimates. In the mean-field setting, we exploit symmetry to construct explicit examples of equilibria. Finally, we conclude by examining relations to reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Network-Constrained Policy Optimization for Adaptive Multi-agent Vehicle Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26089v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation (HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections (hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Morphology-Aware Graph Reinforcement Learning for Tensegrity Robot Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26067v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high resilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations, and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable real-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity robot control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Real-World Overtaking in F1TENTH Racing Employing Reinforcement Learning Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26040v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While autonomous racing performance in Time-Trial scenarios has seen significant progress and development, autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing and overtaking are still severely limited. These limitations are particularly apparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms struggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is important, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful opportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised physical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate overtaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art. This research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning to reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and reality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against opponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results demonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate overtaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent trained just to race.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Visual Language Model for Chest X-Ray Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23968v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent, stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer human-AI collaboration. Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality is as critical as prediction quality.</p></details> | NV-Reason-CXR-3B |

We propose a unified conformal prediction framework for infinite-horizon policy evaluation that constructs distribution-free prediction intervals {for returns} in both on-policy and off-policy settings. Our method integrates distributional RL with conformal calibration, addressing challenges such as unobserved returns, temporal dependencies, and distributional shifts. We propose a modular pseudo-return construction based on truncated rollouts and a time-aware calibration strategy using experience replay and weighted subsampling. These innovations mitigate model bias and restore approximate exchangeability, enabling uncertainty quantification even under policy shifts. Our theoretical analysis provides coverage guarantees that account for model misspecification and importance weight estimation. Empirical results, including experiments in synthetic and benchmark environments like Mountain Car, show that our method significantly improves coverage and reliability over standard distributional RL baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[PORTool: Tool-Use LLM Training with Rewarded Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26020v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets, enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step, tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However, these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine, thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer. Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25992v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance. Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework for reasoning-oriented LLMs.</p></details> |  |

For example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset, demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with attention-aware inverse planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[InputDSA: Demixing then Comparing Recurrent and Externally Driven Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25943v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In control problems and basic scientific modeling, it is important to compare observations with dynamical simulations. For example, comparing two neural systems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and deep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems based on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However, DSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar systems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because real-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account for the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for comparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA (iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both input and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We demonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed, input-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are unknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in similarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing networks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks are more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats performing a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from input-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making. Our work demonstrates that InputDSA is a robust and efficient method for comparing intrinsic dynamics and the effect of external input on dynamical systems.</p></details> | 36 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Market Making: Competition without Collusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25929v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithmic collusion has emerged as a central question in AI: Will the interaction between different AI agents deployed in markets lead to collusion? More generally, understanding how emergent behavior, be it a cartel or market dominance from more advanced bots, affects the market overall is an important research question. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to study algorithmic collusion in market making. The framework includes a self-interested market maker (Agent~A), which is trained in an uncertain environment shaped by an adversary, and three bottom-layer competitors: the self-interested Agent~B1 (whose objective is to maximize its own PnL), the competitive Agent~B2 (whose objective is to minimize the PnL of its opponent), and the hybrid Agent~B$^\star$, which can modulate between the behavior of the other two. To analyze how these agents shape the behavior of each other and affect market outcomes, we propose interaction-level metrics that quantify behavioral asymmetry and system-level dynamics, while providing signals potentially indicative of emergent interaction patterns. Experimental results show that Agent~B2 secures dominant performance in a zero-sum setting against B1, aggressively capturing order flow while tightening average spreads, thus improving market execution efficiency. In contrast, Agent~B$^\star$ exhibits a self-interested inclination when co-existing with other profit-seeking agents, securing dominant market share through adaptive quoting, yet exerting a milder adverse impact on the rewards of Agents~A and B1 compared to B2. These findings suggest that adaptive incentive control supports more sustainable strategic co-existence in heterogeneous agent environments and offers a structured lens for evaluating behavioral design in algorithmic trading systems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking. Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Although recent work explores using reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action log-likelihoods from iterative denoising. We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for efficient RL exploration. We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6% to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to 85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks, demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation. Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online RL for flow-based VLAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress. 24 pages</p></details> |

We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures, captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema; a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over 14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions. Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of 55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA, outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable medical VQA training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page, code, data, and models: https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/MedVLSynther/</p></details> |

This paper presents MetaLore, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based framework for joint communication and computational resource allocation in Metaverse or digital twin environments. MetaLore dynamically shares the communication bandwidth and computational resources among sensors and mobile devices to optimize synchronization, while offering high throughput performance. Special treatment is given in satisfying end-to-end delay guarantees. A key contribution is the introduction of two novel Age of Information (AoI) metrics: Age of Request Information (AoRI) and Age of Sensor Information (AoSI), integrated into the reward function to enhance synchronization quality. An open source simulator has been extended to incorporate and evaluate the approach. The DRL solution is shown to achieve the performance of full-enumeration brute-force solutions by making use of a small, task-oriented observation space of two queue lengths at the network side. This allows the DRL approach the flexibility to effectively and autonomously adapt to dynamic traffic conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted at IEEE GLOBECOM 2025.

| **[Score-Aware Policy-Gradient and Performance Guarantees using Local Lyapunov Stability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02804v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a policy-gradient method for model-based reinforcement learning (RL) that exploits a type of stationary distributions commonly obtained from Markov decision processes (MDPs) in stochastic networks, queueing systems, and statistical mechanics. Specifically, when the stationary distribution of the MDP belongs to an exponential family that is parametrized by policy parameters, we can improve existing policy gradient methods for average-reward RL. Our key identification is a family of gradient estimators, called score-aware gradient estimators (SAGEs), that enable policy gradient estimation without relying on value-function estimation in the aforementioned setting. We show that SAGE-based policy-gradient locally converges, and we obtain its regret. This includes cases when the state space of the MDP is countable and unstable policies can exist. Under appropriate assumptions such as starting sufficiently close to a maximizer and the existence of a local Lyapunov function, the policy under SAGE-based stochastic gradient ascent has an overwhelming probability of converging to the associated optimal policy. Furthermore, we conduct a numerical comparison between a SAGE-based policy-gradient method and an actor-critic method on several examples inspired from stochastic networks, queueing systems, and models derived from statistical physics. Our results demonstrate that a SAGE-based method finds close-to-optimal policies faster than an actor-critic method.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop an optimal navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow, characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate (SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALDEN: Reinforcement Learning for Active Navigation and Evidence Gathering in Long Documents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25668v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and efficient long-document understanding.</p></details> |  |

The model is pretrained on a 206B-token corpus spanning scientific text, pure sequences, and sequence-text pairs, then aligned via SFT on 40M instructions, annealed cold-start bootstrapping to elicit long-form chain-of-thought, and reinforcement learning with task-specific reward shaping, which instills deliberate scientific reasoning. It supports four capability families, covering up to 103 tasks across workflows: (i) faithful translation between text and scientific formats, (ii) text/knowledge extraction, (iii) property prediction, (iv) property classification, (v) unconditional and conditional sequence generation and design. Compared with specialist systems, our approach broadens instruction coverage, improves cross-domain generalization, and enhances fidelity. We detail data curation and training and show that cross-discipline learning strengthens transfer and downstream reliability.

| **[OpenReward: Learning to Reward Long-form Agentic Tasks via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24636v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models (RMs) have become essential for aligning large language models (LLMs), serving as scalable proxies for human evaluation in both training and inference. However, existing RMs struggle on knowledge-intensive and long-form tasks, where evaluating correctness requires grounding beyond the model's internal knowledge. This limitation hinders them from reliably discriminating subtle quality differences, especially when external evidence is necessary. To address this, we introduce OpenRM, a tool-augmented long-form reward model that systematically judges open-ended responses by invoking external tools to gather relevant evidence. We train OpenRM with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on over 27K synthesized pairwise examples generated through a controllable data synthesis framework. The training objective jointly supervises intermediate tool usage and final outcome accuracy, incentivizing our reward model to learn effective evidence-based judgment strategies. Extensive experiments on three newly-collected datasets and two widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that OpenRM substantially outperforms existing reward modeling approaches. As a further step, we integrate OpenRM into both inference-time response selection and training-time data selection. This yields consistent gains in downstream LLM alignment tasks, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented reward models for scaling reliable long-form evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepVideo-R1: Video Reinforcement Fine-Tuning via Difficulty-aware Regressive GRPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07464v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown impressive success using a PPO-style reinforcement algorithm with group-normalized rewards. However, the effectiveness of GRPO in Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) has still been less studyed. In this paper, we explore GRPO and identify two problems that deteriorate the effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) vanishing advantage. To mitigate these challenges, we propose DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with Reg-GRPO (Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation. Reg-GRPO reformulates the GRPO loss function into a regression task that directly predicts the advantage in GRPO, eliminating the need for safeguards such as the clipping and min functions. It directly aligns the model with advantages, providing guidance to prefer better ones. The difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy augments input prompts/videos to locate the difficulty of samples at solvable difficulty levels, enabling diverse reward signals. Our experimental results show that our approach significantly improves video reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical framework that frames this challenge as an integrated skill planning & scheduling problem, going beyond purely sequential decision-making to support simultaneous skill invocation. Our approach is built upon a library of single-arm and bimanual primitive skills, each trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in GPU-accelerated simulation. We then train a Transformer-based planner on a dataset of skill compositions to act as a high-level scheduler, simultaneously predicting the discrete schedule of skills as well as their continuous parameters. We demonstrate that our method achieves higher success rates on complex, contact-rich tasks than end-to-end RL approaches and produces more efficient, coordinated behaviors than traditional sequential-only planners.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL-I2IT: Image-to-Image Translation with Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13672v8)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing Image-to-Image Translation (I2IT) methods generate images in a single run of a deep learning (DL) model. However, designing such a single-step model is always challenging, requiring a huge number of parameters and easily falling into bad global minimums and overfitting. In this work, we reformulate I2IT as a step-wise decision-making problem via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and propose a novel framework that performs RL-based I2IT (RL-I2IT). The key feature in the RL-I2IT framework is to decompose a monolithic learning process into small steps with a lightweight model to progressively transform a source image successively to a target image. Considering that it is challenging to handle high dimensional continuous state and action spaces in the conventional RL framework, we introduce meta policy with a new concept Plan to the standard Actor-Critic model, which is of a lower dimension than the original image and can facilitate the actor to generate a tractable high dimensional action. In the RL-I2IT framework, we also employ a task-specific auxiliary learning strategy to stabilize the training process and improve the performance of the corresponding task. Experiments on several I2IT tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method when facing high-dimensional continuous action space problems. Our implementation of the RL-I2IT framework is available at https://github.com/Algolzw/SPAC-Deformable-Registration.</p></details> |  |
| **[EHR-R1: A Reasoning-Enhanced Foundational Language Model for Electronic Health Record Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25628v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap, specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis. Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning 42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins, EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a novel cooperative rate-splitting (CRS)-aided transmission framework, where an aboveground relay decodes and forwards the common stream to underground devices (UDs). Based on this framework, we formulate a max-min fairness optimization problem that jointly optimizes power allocation, message splitting, and time slot scheduling to maximize the minimum achievable rate across UDs. To solve this high-dimensional non-convex problem under uncertain channels, we develop a deep reinforcement learning solution framework based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm that integrates distribution-aware action modeling and a multi-branch actor network. Simulation results under a realistic underground pipeline monitoring scenario demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves average max-min rate gains exceeding $167\%$ over conventional benchmark strategies across various numbers of UDs and underground conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, and submitted to IEEE TVT</p></details> |
| **[TuneNSearch: a hybrid transfer learning and local search approach for solving vehicle routing problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12662v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces TuneNSearch, a hybrid transfer learning and local search approach for addressing diverse variants of the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Our method uses reinforcement learning to generate high-quality solutions, which are subsequently refined by an efficient local search procedure. To ensure broad adaptability across VRP variants, TuneNSearch begins with a pre-training phase on the multi-depot VRP (MDVRP), followed by a fine-tuning phase to adapt it to other problem formulations. The learning phase utilizes a Transformer-based architecture enhanced with edge-aware attention, which integrates edge distances directly into the attention mechanism to better capture spatial relationships inherent to routing problems. We show that the pre-trained model generalizes effectively to single-depot variants, achieving performance comparable to models trained specifically on single-depot instances. Simultaneously, it maintains strong performance on multi-depot variants, an ability that models pre-trained solely on single-depot problems lack. For example, on 100-node instances of multi-depot variants, TuneNSearch outperforms a model pre-trained on the CVRP by 44%. In contrast, on 100-node instances of single-depot variants, TuneNSearch performs similar to the CVRP model. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive computational experiments on public benchmark and randomly generated instances. Across multiple CVRPLIB datasets, TuneNSearch consistently achieves performance deviations of less than 3% from the best-known solutions in the literature, compared to 6-25% for other neural-based models, depending on problem complexity. Overall, our approach demonstrates strong generalization to different problem sizes, instance distributions, and VRP formulations, while maintaining polynomial runtime complexity despite the integration of the local search algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[GradeSQL: Test-Time Inference with Outcome Reward Models for Text-to-SQL Generation from Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01308v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users. Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still struggle with complex queries. To address this limitation, test-time strategies such as Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the assumption that LLMs can produce correct answers after multiple attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or the most frequently generated one through Majority Voting. Recently, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic correctness, have emerged as a promising reinforcement learning approach for improving model alignment. We argue that ORMs could serve as an effective new test-time heuristic, although their application in this context remains largely underexplored. In this work, we propose a unified framework for training ORMs tailored to the Text-to-SQL task and assess their effectiveness as a test-time heuristic within the BoN strategy. We benchmark ORMs against ex-BoN and Maj across the BIRD and Spider datasets, fine-tuning diverse open-source LLMs from the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3 families. Results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and +2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Teachers of Test Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08388v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training reasoning language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for one-hot correctness inherently relies on the LM being able to explore and solve its task with some chance at initialization. Furthermore, a key use case of reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs) focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to simply "connect-the-dots" with detailed explanations tailored for their students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning framework.

| **[Off-policy Reinforcement Learning with Model-based Exploration Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25529v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration. The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning, leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across complex control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero Reinforcement Learning Towards General Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25528v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains. Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTIR-SQL: Multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning Reinforcement Learning for Text-to-SQL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25510v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback, which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\% accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev, significantly outperforming existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Pseudo-Relevance Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25488v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query rewriting is a fundamental technique in information retrieval (IR). It typically employs the retrieval result as relevance feedback to refine the query and thereby addresses the vocabulary mismatch between user queries and relevant documents. Traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and its vector-based extension (VPRF) improve retrieval performance by leveraging top-retrieved documents as relevance feedback. However, they are constructed based on two major hypotheses: the relevance assumption (top documents are relevant) and the model assumption (rewriting methods need to be designed specifically for particular model architectures). While recent large language models (LLMs)-based generative relevance feedback (GRF) enables model-free query reformulation, it either suffers from severe LLM hallucination or, again, relies on the relevance assumption to guarantee the effectiveness of rewriting quality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an assumption-relaxed framework: \textit{Generalized Pseudo Relevance Feedback} (GPRF), which performs model-free, natural language rewriting based on retrieved documents, not only eliminating the model assumption but also reducing dependence on the relevance assumption. Specifically, we design a utility-oriented training pipeline with reinforcement learning to ensure robustness against noisy feedback. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and retrievers demonstrate that GPRF consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing it as an effective and generalizable framework for query rewriting.</p></details> |  |
| **[SATURN: SAT-based Reinforcement Learning to Unleash Language Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16368v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to design reinforcement learning (RL) tasks that effectively unleash the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) remains an open question. Existing RL tasks (e.g., math, programming, and constructing reasoning tasks) suffer from three key limitations: (1) Scalability. They rely heavily on human annotation or expensive LLM synthesis to generate sufficient training data. (2) Verifiability. LLMs' outputs are hard to verify automatically and reliably. (3) Controllable Difficulty. Most tasks lack fine-grained difficulty control, making it hard to train LLMs to develop reasoning ability from easy to hard. To address these limitations, we propose Saturn, a SAT-based RL framework that uses Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems to train and evaluate LLMs reasoning. Saturn enables scalable task construction, rule-based verification, and precise difficulty control. Saturn designs a curriculum learning pipeline that continuously improves LLMs' reasoning capability by constructing SAT tasks of increasing difficulty and training LLMs from easy to hard. To ensure stable training, we design a principled mechanism to control difficulty transitions. We introduce Saturn-2.6k, a dataset of 2,660 SAT problems with varying difficulty. It supports the evaluation of how LLM reasoning changes with problem difficulty. We apply Saturn to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen and obtain Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B. We achieve several notable results: (1) On SAT problems, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B achieve average pass@3 improvements of +14.0 and +28.1, respectively. (2) On math and programming tasks, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B improve average scores by +4.9 and +1.8 on benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench). (3) Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach in constructing RL tasks, Saturn achieves further improvements of +8.8%. We release the source code, data, and models to support future research.</p></details> |  |

While parameter sharing (PS) is standard for efficient learning, it notoriously suppresses the behavioural diversity required for specialisation. This failure is largely due to cross-agent gradient interference, a problem we find is surprisingly exacerbated by the common practice of coupling agent IDs with observations. Existing remedies typically add complexity through altered objectives, manual preset diversity levels, or sequential updates -- raising a fundamental question: can shared policies adapt without these intricacies? We propose a solution built on a key insight: an agent-conditioned hypernetwork can generate agent-specific parameters and decouple observation- and agent-conditioned gradients, directly countering the interference from coupling agent IDs with observations. Our resulting method, HyperMARL, avoids the complexities of prior work and empirically reduces policy gradient variance. Across diverse MARL benchmarks (22 scenarios, up to 30 agents), HyperMARL achieves performance competitive with six key baselines while preserving behavioural diversity comparable to non-parameter sharing methods, establishing it as a versatile and principled approach for adaptive MARL.

While existing solutions rely on accurate object models or specialized sensors and grippers, this adds complexity and often lacks generalization. To address this problem, we present a vision-based reinforcement learning approach that incorporates a stress-penalized reward to discourage damage to the object explicitly. In addition, to bootstrap learning, we incorporate offline demonstrations as well as a designed curriculum progressing from rigid proxies to deformables. We evaluate the proposed method in both simulated and real-world scenarios, showing that the policy learned in simulation can be transferred to the real world in a zero-shot manner, performing tasks such as picking up and pushing tofu. Our results show that the learned policies exhibit a damage-aware, gentle manipulation behavior, demonstrating their effectiveness by decreasing the stress applied to fragile objects by 36.5% while achieving the task goals, compared to vanilla RL policies.</p></details> | Under review |

This work presents an in-depth review of RL principles, advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, and their integration into robotic and control systems. Beginning with the formalism of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), the study outlines essential elements of the agent-environment interaction and explores core algorithmic strategies including actor-critic methods, value-based learning, and policy gradients. Emphasis is placed on modern DRL techniques such as DDPG, TD3, PPO, and SAC, which have shown promise in solving high-dimensional, continuous control tasks. A structured taxonomy is introduced to categorize RL applications across domains such as locomotion, manipulation, multi-agent coordination, and human-robot interaction, along with training methodologies and deployment readiness levels. The review synthesizes recent research efforts, highlighting technical trends, design patterns, and the growing maturity of RL in real-world robotics. Overall, this work aims to bridge theoretical advances with practical implementations, providing a consolidated perspective on the evolving role of RL in autonomous robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

To be effective, credit assignment methods must preserve the environment's optimal policy. Some recent approaches attempt this by enforcing return equivalence, where the sum of distributed rewards must equal the team reward. However, their guarantees are conditional on a learned model's regression accuracy, making them unreliable in practice. We introduce Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution (TAR$^2$), an approach that decouples credit modeling from this constraint. A neural network learns unnormalized contribution scores, while a separate, deterministic normalization step enforces return equivalence by construction. We demonstrate that this method is equivalent to a valid Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS), which guarantees the optimal policy is preserved regardless of model accuracy. Empirically, on challenging SMACLite and Google Research Football (GRF) benchmarks, TAR$^2$ accelerates learning and achieves higher final performance than strong baselines. These results establish our method as an effective solution for the agent-temporal credit assignment problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) relaxes this by allowing collaboration with unknown partners, yet existing variants still presume shared conventions. We introduce Multil-party Ad Hoc Teamwork (MAHT), where controlled agents must coordinate with multiple mutually unfamiliar groups of uncontrolled teammates. To address this, we propose MARs, which builds a sparse skeleton graph and applies relational modeling to capture cross-group dvnamics. Experiments on MPE and starCralt ll show that MARs outperforms MARL and AHT baselines while converging faster.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2 protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis showed that this ''hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel, time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious intervention protocols in complex biological systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Adversarial Pre-Padding: Generating Evasive Network Traffic Against Transformer-Based Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25810v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To date, traffic obfuscation techniques have been widely adopted to protect network data privacy and security by obscuring the true patterns of traffic. Nevertheless, as the pre-trained models emerge, especially transformer-based classifiers, existing traffic obfuscation methods become increasingly vulnerable, as witnessed by current studies reporting the traffic classification accuracy up to 99\% or higher. To counter such high-performance transformer-based classification models, we in this paper propose a novel and effective \underline{adv}ersarial \underline{traffic}-generating approach (AdvTraffic\footnote{The code and data are available at: http://xxx}). Our approach has two key innovations: (i) a pre-padding strategy is proposed to modify packets, which effectively overcomes the limitations of existing research against transformer-based models for network traffic classification; and (ii) a reinforcement learning model is employed to optimize network traffic perturbations, aiming to maximize adversarial effectiveness against transformer-based classification models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply adversarial perturbation techniques to defend against transformer-based traffic classifiers. Furthermore, our method can be easily deployed into practical network environments. Finally, multi-faceted experiments are conducted across several real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively undermine transformer-based classifiers, significantly reducing classification accuracy from 99\% to as low as 25.68\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAP: Graph-Based Agent Planning with Parallel Tool Use and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25320v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However, existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution, failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

| **[Dense and Diverse Goal Coverage in Multi Goal Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25311v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state distribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Adaptive Design of mmWave Initial Access Codebooks using Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25271v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Initial access (IA) is the process by which user equipment (UE) establishes its first connection with a base station. In 5G systems, particularly at millimeter-wave frequencies, IA integrates beam management to support highly directional transmissions. The base station employs a codebook of beams for the transmission of Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), which are periodically swept to detect and connect users. The design of this SSB codebook is critical for ensuring reliable, wide-area coverage. In current networks, SSB codebooks are meticulously engineered by domain experts. While these expert-defined codebooks provide a robust baseline, they lack flexibility in dynamic or heterogeneous environments where user distributions vary, limiting their overall effectiveness. This paper proposes a hybrid Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for adaptive SSB codebook design. Building on top of expert knowledge, the RL agent leverages a pool of expert-designed SSB beams and learns to adaptively select or combine them based on real-time feedback. This enables the agent to dynamically tailor codebooks to the actual environment, without requiring explicit user location information, while always respecting practical beam constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that, on average, the proposed approach improves user connectivity by 10.8$\%$ compared to static expert configurations. These findings highlight the potential of combining expert knowledge with data-driven optimization to achieve more intelligent, flexible, and resilient beam management in next-generation wireless networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE ICC 2026</p></details> |
| **[The influence of the random numbers quality on the results in stochastic simulations and machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25269v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) are ubiquitous in stochastic simulations and machine learning (ML), where they drive sampling, parameter initialization, regularization, and data shuffling. While widely used, the potential impact of PRNG statistical quality on computational results remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate whether differences in PRNG quality, as measured by standard statistical test suites, can influence outcomes in representative stochastic applications. Seven PRNGs were evaluated, ranging from low-quality linear congruential generators (LCGs) with known statistical deficiencies to high-quality generators such as Mersenne Twister, PCG, and Philox. We applied these PRNGs to four distinct tasks: an epidemiological agent-based model (ABM), two independent from-scratch MNIST classification implementations (Python/NumPy and C++), and a reinforcement learning (RL) CartPole environment. Each experiment was repeated 30 times per generator using fixed seeds to ensure reproducibility, and outputs were compared using appropriate statistical analyses. Results show that very poor statistical quality, as in the ''bad'' LCG failing 125 TestU01 Crush tests, produces significant deviations in ABM epidemic dynamics, reduces MNIST classification accuracy, and severely degrades RL performance. In contrast, mid-and good-quality LCGs-despite failing a limited number of Crush or BigCrush tests-performed comparably to top-tier PRNGs in most tasks, with the RL experiment being the primary exception where performance scaled with statistical quality. Our findings indicate that, once a generator meets a sufficient statistical robustness threshold, its family or design has negligible impact on outcomes for most workloads, allowing selection to be guided by performance and implementation considerations. However, the use of low-quality PRNGs in sensitive stochastic computations can introduce substantial and systematic errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReSeek: A Self-Correcting Framework for Search Agents with Instructive Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00568v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Search agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to perform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to suboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To address these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework for training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction mechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from erroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action, the agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide this process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which decomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a utility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query. Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets, we introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently curated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and practically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek significantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path faithfulness.</p></details> | 19 pages |

However, existing methods typically require multiple training samples per motion category, rendering the collection of high-quality human motion datasets both labor-intensive and costly. To address this, we propose a novel approach that trains effective humanoid motion policies using only a single non-walking target motion sample alongside readily available walking motions. The core idea lies in leveraging order-preserving optimal transport to compute distances between walking and non-walking sequences, followed by interpolation along geodesics to generate new intermediate pose skeletons, which are then optimized for collision-free configurations and retargeted to the humanoid before integration into a simulated environment for policy training via reinforcement learning. Experimental evaluations on the CMU MoCap dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving superior performance across metrics. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning, existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1) Noise-Injected Exploration Policy: Perturbing visual inputs with Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual scenarios; and (2) Bayesian Advantage Estimation: Formulating advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones. Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL 3B.

| **[FELA: A Multi-Agent Evolutionary System for Feature Engineering of Industrial Event Log Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25223v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events, represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods, often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA (Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate, and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated, interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world environments.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |
| **[The Landscape of Agentic Reinforcement Learning for LLMs: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02547v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous, decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL. Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose AI agents.</p></details> |  |

For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones. Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes problem-specific strategies in reasoning.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

However, approaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to jointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these challenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short stochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step consistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump generation, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a trajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a denoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and on a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step DDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing latency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow inference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a practical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.</p></details> |  |

While several recent works have explored sliding-window formulations for CRs, these methods are limited to simplified, discrete-time approximations and do not provide stochastic representations. In contrast, current stochastic filter methods must run at the speed of measurements, limiting their full potential. Recent works in continuous-time estimation techniques for CRs show a principled approach to addressing this runtime constraint, but are currently restricted to offline operation. In this work, we present a sliding-window filter (SWF) for continuous-time state estimation of CRs that improves upon the accuracy of a filter approach while enabling continuous-time methods to operate online, all while running at faster-than-real-time speeds. This represents the first stochastic SWF specifically designed for CRs, providing a promising direction for future research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the desired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool orientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering framework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse kinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions using tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action trajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired skills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive experimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our trained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two distinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool usage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

Existing approaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical frameworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent memory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long horizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting the need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we introduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable, and robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene geometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared representation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a brain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global planning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute actions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution enables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent state synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex coordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results demonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous embodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and robust multi-robot collaboration.

| **[Human-in-the-loop Online Rejection Sampling for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26406v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic manipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with RL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at intermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but often underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose Hi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during online fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective to provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we develop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible online human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for learning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by reliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better performance.</p></details> | 8 pages |

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic deployment, their reliance on offline expert demonstrations critically limits their capacity for post-deployment refinement. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce Action Preference Optimization (APO), a method designed to refine VLA models by human-assisted preference alignment gathered through interaction with environments. This method begins with a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. However, directly leveraging these interaction trajectories for preference optimization is non-trivial due to the challenges of irreversible robotic actions and token distribution mismatch. To solve this, APO proposes an adaptive reweighting algorithm with binary desirability signals derived from interaction, empowering VLA models effectively suppress failure-prone actions while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Ultimately, APO equips VLA models with the crucial capability to learn from failure, paving the way for their iterative refinement and reliable deployment in dynamic environments. The experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior generalization and robustness of our human-assisted framework across a variety of manipulation tasks. We believe this work could bring insights for efficient and stable optimization of VLA models through human-robot collaboration.

Our research investigates how different levels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse, extending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories into a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view videos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot), or high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we triangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and uncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and qualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not linear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in eeriness and "spine-tingling" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley, elicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and guilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots compared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as anthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments of property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance proposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader societal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not dampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering critical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.</p></details> |  |

When these services end, the resulting harm raises complex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds are broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative survey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is viewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and government. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and parental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of whether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters propose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while opponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency. Ultimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared responsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by detailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete design and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot discontinuation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Morphology-Aware Graph Reinforcement Learning for Tensegrity Robot Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26067v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high resilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations, and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable real-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity robot control.</p></details> |  |

We develop and evaluate a machine-learning-based workflow verification system that uses acoustic emissions generated by robotic movements. The system can determine whether real-time behavior is consistent with expected commands. The evaluation takes into account movement speed, direction, and microphone distance. The results show that individual robot movements can be validated with over 80% accuracy under baseline conditions using four different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Additionally, workflows such as pick-and-place and packing could be identified with similarly high confidence. Our findings demonstrate that acoustic signals can support real-time, low-cost, passive verification in sensitive robotic environments without requiring hardware modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, Corresponding Author: Prof. Shishir Nagaraja (shishir.nagaraja@newcastle.ac.uk)</p></details> |

Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation such as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is inconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded progress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision that generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware, video-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task stages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from natural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation across variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index labeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our reward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building on it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters high-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts. Integrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83% success on folding T-shirts from the flattened state and 67% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing vanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8% and 0% success. Overall, our results highlight reward modeling as a key enabler for scalable, annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Debate2Create: Robot Co-design via Large Language Model Debates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25850v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a long-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling between body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in which large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical debate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each round, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a control agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A panel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in simulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through iterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing increasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and specialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a quadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther than the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a powerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that multi-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising new paradigm for automated robot design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Collapse of Steered Vine Robots Under Their Own Weight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25727v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft, vine-inspired growing robots that move by eversion are highly mobile in confined environments, but, when faced with gaps in the environment, they may collapse under their own weight while navigating a desired path. In this work, we present a comprehensive collapse model that can predict the collapse length of steered robots in any shape using true shape information and tail tension. We validate this model by collapsing several unsteered robots without true shape information. The model accurately predicts the trends of those experiments. We then attempt to collapse a robot steered with a single actuator at different orientations. Our models accurately predict collapse when it occurs. Finally, we demonstrate how this could be used in the field by having a robot attempt a gap-crossing task with and without inflating its actuators. The robot needs its actuators inflated to cross the gap without collapsing, which our model supports. Our model has been specifically tested on straight and series pouch motor-actuated robots made of non-stretchable material, but it could be applied to other robot variations. This work enables us to model the robot's collapse behavior in any open environment and understand the parameters it needs to succeed in 3D navigation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Our approach adds (i) FiLM conditioning to visual backbones for task-aware perception, (ii) an auxiliary intent head that predicts collaborator hand pose and target cues, and (iii) action-space post-processing that predicts compact deltas (position/rotation) and PCA-reduced finger joints before mapping to full commands. Using a multi-view, teleoperated Franka and Mimic-hand dataset augmented with MediaPipe hand poses, we demonstrate that delta actions are well-behaved and that four principal components explain ~96% of hand-joint variance. Ablations identify action post-processing as the primary performance driver; auxiliary intent helps, FiLM is mixed, and a directional motion loss is detrimental. A real-time stack (~0.3 s latency on one RTX 4090) composes "pick-up" and "pass" into a long-horizon behavior. We surface "trainer overfitting" to specific demonstrators as the key limitation.</p></details> |  |
| **[RobEthiChor: Automated Context-aware Ethics-based Negotiation for Autonomous Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22664v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The presence of autonomous systems is growing at a fast pace and it is impacting many aspects of our lives. Designed to learn and act independently, these systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention. However, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which are unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the decision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous systems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When multiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must negotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the parties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this challenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous systems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into their decision-making through ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor features a domain-agnostic reference architecture for designing autonomous systems capable of ethic-based negotiating. The paper also presents RobEthiChor-Ros, an implementation of RobEthiChor within the Robot Operating System (ROS), which can be deployed on robots to provide them with ethics-based negotiation capabilities. To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real robots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource contention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the system in realizing ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor allowed robots to reach an agreement in more than 73% of the scenarios with an acceptable negotiation time (0.67s on average). Experiments also demonstrate that the negotiation approach implemented in RobEthiChor is scalable.</p></details> |  |

Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue, environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition, while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving the Right Problem with Multi-Robot Formations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25422v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formation control simplifies minimizing multi-robot cost functions by encoding a cost function as a shape the robots maintain. However, by reducing complex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining the shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or Box formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation. When more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a static shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose a formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost function while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation planner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative robot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear and non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions. We theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do not need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized using relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are realized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's direct approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for military-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations, we show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When minimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation planner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning provides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that closely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape abstraction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SAE WCX 2026</p></details> |

This work presents an in-depth review of RL principles, advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, and their integration into robotic and control systems. Beginning with the formalism of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), the study outlines essential elements of the agent-environment interaction and explores core algorithmic strategies including actor-critic methods, value-based learning, and policy gradients. Emphasis is placed on modern DRL techniques such as DDPG, TD3, PPO, and SAC, which have shown promise in solving high-dimensional, continuous control tasks. A structured taxonomy is introduced to categorize RL applications across domains such as locomotion, manipulation, multi-agent coordination, and human-robot interaction, along with training methodologies and deployment readiness levels. The review synthesizes recent research efforts, highlighting technical trends, design patterns, and the growing maturity of RL in real-world robotics. Overall, this work aims to bridge theoretical advances with practical implementations, providing a consolidated perspective on the evolving role of RL in autonomous robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

The numerous applications of agricultural robots rely on the transmission of data via mobile network, with the amount of data depending on the services offered by the robots and the level of on-board technology. Nevertheless, infrastructure required to deploy these robots, as well as the related energy and environmental consequences, appear overlooked in the digital agriculture literature. In this study, we propose a method for assessing the additional energy consumption and carbon footprint induced by a large-scale deployment of agricultural robots. Our method also estimates the share of agricultural area that can be managed by the deployed robots with respect to network infrastructure constraints. We have applied this method to metropolitan France mobile network and agricultural parcels for five different robotic scenarios. Our results show that increasing the robot's bitrate needs leads to significant additional impacts, which increase at a pace that is poorly captured by classical linear extrapolation methods. When constraining the network to the existing sites, increased bitrate needs also comes with a rapidly decreasing manageable agricultural area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Best ...</summary><p>Best Paper ICT4S 2025</p></details> |

The relative measurement between two points on the calibration plate is used to determine predefined error parameters of the system. In comparison to conventional measurement methods, like laser tracker or motion capture systems, the calibration plate provides a more mechanically robust and cheaper alternative, which is furthermore easier to transport due to its small size. The calibration method, the plate design, the mathematical description of the error system as well as the identification of the parameters are described in detail. For identifying the error parameters, the least squares method and a constrained optimization problem are used. The functionality of this method was demonstrated in experiments that led to promising results, correlated with one of a laser tracker calibration. The modeling and identification of the error parameters is done for a gantry machine, but is not restricted to that type of robot.</p></details> | pp 309-317 |
| **[Development of Implicit-Explicit Control Based Amphibious Centipede-Type Robot and Evaluation of its Mobile Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25280v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-legged mobile robots possess high mobility performance in rough terrain environments, stemming from their high postural stability, joint flexibility, and the redundancy provided by multiple legs. In prior research on navigating between different environments such as land and water, the primary strategy employed involves switching to a controller that generates an appropriate gait for the new environment upon entering it. However, designing appropriate gaits for each complex and diverse environment and accurately determining controller switching for each environment is challenging. Therefore, this research develops a centipede-type mobile robot that navigates both aquatic and terrestrial environments with a simple, unified control scheme, based on the implicit-explicit control philosophy and by ingeniously designing the robot's body structure. In this research, we developed the robot featuring flexible joints and left and right legs on each body segment and focused on the leg structure which has extensive contact with the environment. This paper evaluates the locomotion performance on land and water using the three developed leg structures, using the robot's leg slip rate and actuator energy consumption as evaluation metrics. The experimental results confirmed the existence of an appropriate leg structure capable of navigating both aquatic and terrestrial environments under identical control.</p></details> |  |

Robots move in an environment that contains some regions of interest, while the specification for the entire team can include avoidance, visits, or sequencing of these regions of interest. The mission is expressed in terms of a Petri net corresponding to an automaton, while each robot is also modeled by a state machine Petri net. The current work brings about the following contributions with respect to existing solutions for related problems. First, we propose a novel model, denoted High-Level robot team Petri Net (HLrtPN) system, to incorporate the specification and robot models into the Nets-within-Nets paradigm. A guard function, named Global Enabling Function, is designed to synchronize the firing of transitions so that robot motions do not violate the specification. Then, the solution is found by simulating the HLrtPN system in a specific software tool that accommodates Nets-within-Nets. Illustrative examples based on Linear Temporal Logic missions support the computational feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>[Note...</summary><p>[Note for readers] This paper has been extended from a previous submission to 62nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, Dec. 13-15, 2023.

| **[Control Modes of Teleoperated Surgical Robotic System's Tools in Ophthalmic Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13654v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of a teleoperated surgical robotic system designed for minimally invasive procedures enables the emulation of two distinct control modes through a dedicated input device of the surgical console: (1) Inside Control Mode, which emulates tool manipulation near the distal end as if the surgeon was holding the tip of the instrument inside the patient's body; (2) Outside Control Mode, which emulates manipulation near the proximal end as if the surgeon was holding the tool externally. The aim of this research is to compare the surgeon's performance on these two modes of operation along with various scaling factors in a simulated vitreoretinal surgical setting. The console of Intraocular Robotic Interventional Surgical System (IRISS) was utilized but the surgical robot itself and the human eye anatomy was simulated by a virtual environment projected microscope view of an intraocular setup to a VR headset. Five experienced vitreoretinal surgeons and five subjects with no surgical experience used the system to perform four fundamental tool/tissue tasks common to vitreoretinal surgery: touch and reset; grasp and drop; inject; circular tracking. Results indicate that Inside Control outperforms Outside Control across multiple tasks and metrics. Higher scaling factors generally performed better, particularly for reducing trajectory errors and tissue damage. This improvement suggests that larger scaling factors enable more precise control, making them the preferred option for fine manipulation. However, completion time was not consistently reduced across all conditions, indicating that surgeons need to balance speed and accuracy based on surgical requirements. By optimizing control dynamics and user interface, robotic teleoperation has the potential to reduce complications, enhance dexterity, and expand the accessibility of high precision procedures to a broader range of practitioners.</p></details> | 10 pages, 11 figures |

However, most existing work focuses on reactive System 1 policies, underutilizing VLMs' strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2 capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation. RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2 interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks, RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 18 figures, Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[NanoVLA: Routing Decoupled Vision-Language Understanding for Nano-sized Generalist Robotic Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25122v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic manipulation by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), and action decoders into a unified architecture. However, their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, such as mobile robots or embedded systems (e.g., Jetson Orin Nano), remains challenging due to high computational demands, especially in real-world scenarios where power, latency, and computational resources are critical. To close this gap, we introduce Nano-scale Vision-Language Action (NanoVLA), a family of lightweight VLA architectures that achieve high performance with minimal resources. Our core innovations include: (1) vision-language decoupling that moves conventional early vision and language inputs fusion in VLM to late stage, achieving better performance while enabling caching and reduce inference overhead and latency; (2) long-short action chunking to ensure smooth, coherent multi-step planning without sacrificing real-time responsiveness; (3) dynamic routing that adaptively assigns lightweight or heavy backbones based on task complexity, further optimizing inference efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmarks, as well as real-world deployments, demonstrate that NanoVLA achieves up to 52x faster inference on edge devices compared to previous state-of-the-art VLA models, with 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing their task accuracy and generalization. Ablation studies confirm that our decoupling strategy preserves cross-task transferability, and the routing module enhances cost-performance trade-offs, enabling practical, high-precision robotic manipulation on resource-constrained hardware.</p></details> |  |

Creating similar swarm intelligence in engineered robots poses challenges to the design of collaborative algorithms that can be programmed at large scales. The assignment-based method has played an eminent role for a very long time in solving collaboration problems of robot swarms. However, it faces fundamental limitations in terms of efficiency and robustness due to its unscalability to swarm variants. This article presents a tutorial review on recent advances in assignment-free collaboration of robot swarms, focusing on the problem of shape formation. A key theoretical component is the recently developed \emph{mean-shift exploration} strategy, which improves the collaboration efficiency of large-scale swarms by dozens of times. Further, the efficiency improvement is more significant as the swarm scale increases. Finally, this article discusses three important applications of the mean-shift exploration strategy, including precise shape formation, area coverage formation, and maneuvering formation, as well as their corresponding industrial scenarios in smart warehousing, area exploration, and cargo transportation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable predictive processing framework for multitask caregiving robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25053v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid aging of societies is intensifying demand for autonomous care robots; however, most existing systems are task-specific and rely on handcrafted preprocessing, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory signals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was able to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and flexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We demonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent dynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty, and infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through visuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on repositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest reduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness. Although the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish predictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle, pointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while offering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible adaptation in uncertain real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a quantum native framework that integrates quantum machine learning with Grover's algorithm to solve kinematic optimization problems efficiently. A parameterized quantum circuit is trained to approximate the forward kinematics model, which then constructs an oracle to identify optimal configurations. Grover's algorithm leverages this oracle to provide a quadratic reduction in search complexity. Demonstrated on simulated 1-DoF, 2-DoF, and dual-arm manipulator tasks, the method achieves significant speedups-up to 93x over classical optimizers like Nelder Mead as problem dimensionality increases. This work establishes a foundational, quantum-native framework for robot kinematic optimization, effectively bridging quantum computing and robotics problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Privacy-Preserving Robotic-Assisted Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12153v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) holds significant promise for advancing surgical precision, adaptability, and autonomous decision-making. However, the development of robust RL models in clinical settings is hindered by key challenges, including stringent patient data privacy regulations, limited access to diverse surgical datasets, and high procedural variability. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL) framework that enables decentralized training of RL models across multiple healthcare institutions without exposing sensitive patient information. A central innovation of the proposed framework is its dynamic policy adaptation mechanism, which allows surgical robots to select and tailor patient-specific policies in real-time, thereby ensuring personalized and Optimised interventions. To uphold rigorous privacy standards while facilitating collaborative learning, the FDRL framework incorporates secure aggregation, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption techniques. Experimental results demonstrate a 60\% reduction in privacy leakage compared to conventional methods, with surgical precision maintained within a 1.5\% margin of a centralized baseline. This work establishes a foundational approach for adaptive, secure, and patient-centric AI-driven surgical robotics, offering a pathway toward clinical translation and scalable deployment across diverse healthcare environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, conference</p></details> |

In this regard, embodying soft and physical computing presents exciting potential. Physical computing seeks to encode inputs into a mechanical computing kernel and leverage the internal interactions among this kernel's constituent elements to compute the output. Moreover, such input-to-output evolution can be re-programmable. This perspective paper proposes a framework for embodying physical computing into soft robots and discusses three unique strategies in the literature: analog oscillators, physical reservoir computing, and physical algorithmic computing. These embodied computers enable the soft robot to perform complex behaviors that would otherwise require CMOS-based electronics -- including coordinated locomotion with obstacle avoidance, payload weight and orientation classification, and programmable operation based on logical rules. This paper will detail the working principles of these embodied physical computing methods, survey the current state-of-the-art, and present a perspective for future development.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeVI-SLAM: Gravity-Enhanced Stereo Visua Inertial SLAM for Underwater Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24533v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI SLAM) for underwater robots remains a significant challenge due to frequent visual degeneracy and insufficient inertial measurement unit (IMU) motion excitation. In this paper, we present GeVI-SLAM, a gravity-enhanced stereo VI SLAM system designed to address these issues. By leveraging the stereo camera's direct depth estimation ability, we eliminate the need to estimate scale during IMU initialization, enabling stable operation even under low acceleration dynamics. With precise gravity initialization, we decouple the pitch and roll from the pose estimation and solve a 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem for pose tracking. This allows the use of a minimal 3-point solver, which significantly reduces computational time to reject outliers within a Random Sample Consensus framework. We further propose a bias-eliminated 4-DOF PnP estimator with provable consistency, ensuring the relative pose converges to the true value as the feature number increases. To handle dynamic motion, we refine the full 6-DOF pose while jointly estimating the IMU covariance, enabling adaptive weighting of the gravity prior. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that GeVI-SLAM achieves higher accuracy and greater stability compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

While many flavors of the TOP exist for planning in multi-robot systems, they assume that all the robots cooperate toward a single objective; thus, they do not extend to settings where the robots compete in reward-scarce environments. We propose Stochastic Prize-Collecting Games (SPCG) as an extension of the TOP to plan in the presence of self-interested robots operating on a graph, under energy constraints and stochastic transitions. A theoretical study on complete and star graphs establishes that there is a unique pure Nash equilibrium in SPCGs that coincides with the optimal routing solution of an equivalent TOP given a rank-based conflict resolution rule. This work proposes two algorithms: Ordinal Rank Search (ORS) to obtain the ''ordinal rank'' --one's effective rank in temporarily-formed local neighborhoods during the games' stages, and Fictitious Ordinal Response Learning (FORL) to obtain best-response policies against one's senior-rank opponents. Empirical evaluations conducted on road networks and synthetic graphs under both dynamic and stationary prize distributions show that 1) the state-aliasing induced by OR-conditioning enables learning policies that scale more efficiently to large team sizes than those trained with the global index, and 2) Policies trained with FORL generalize better to imbalanced prize distributions than those with other multi-agent training methods. Finally, the learned policies in the SPCG achieved between 87% and 95% optimality compared to an equivalent TOP solution obtained by mixed-integer linear programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

Despite recent progress in multi-robot path-crossing-minimal (MPCM) navigation, the majority of approaches depend on the minimal squared-distance reassignment of suitable desired points to robots directly. However, if obstacles occupy the passing space, calculating the actual robot-point distances becomes complex or intractable, which may render the MPCM navigation in obstacle environments inefficient or even infeasible. In this paper, the concurrent-allocation task execution (CATE) algorithm is presented to address this problem (i.e., MPCM navigation in obstacle environments). First, the path-crossing-related elements in terms of (i) robot allocation, (ii) desired-point convergence, and (iii) collision and obstacle avoidance are encoded into integer and control barrier function (CBF) constraints. Then, the proposed constraints are used in an online constrained optimization framework, which implicitly yet effectively minimizes the possible path crossings and trajectory length in obstacle environments by minimizing the desired point allocation cost and slack variables in CBF constraints simultaneously. In this way, the MPCM navigation in obstacle environments can be achieved with flexible spatial orderings. Note that the feasibility of solutions and the asymptotic convergence property of the proposed CATE algorithm in obstacle environments are both guaranteed, and the calculation burden is also reduced by concurrently calculating the optimal allocation and the control input directly without the path planning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Robot Cell Modeling via Exploratory Robot Motions: A Novel and Accessible Data-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01484v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating a collision-free robot motion is crucial for safe applications in real-world settings. This requires an accurate model of all obstacle shapes within the constrained robot cell, which is particularly challenging and time-consuming. The difficulty is heightened in flexible production lines, where the environment model must be updated each time the robot cell is modified. Furthermore, sensor-based methods often necessitate costly hardware and calibration procedures and can be influenced by environmental factors (e.g., light conditions or reflections). To address these challenges, we present a novel data-driven approach to modeling a cluttered workspace, leveraging solely the robot internal joint encoders to capture exploratory motions. By computing the corresponding swept volume (SV), we generate a (conservative) mesh of the environment that is subsequently used for collision checking within established path planning and control methods. Our method significantly reduces the complexity and cost of classical environment modeling by removing the need for computer-aided design (CAD) files and external sensors. We validate the approach with the KUKA LBR iisy collaborative robot in a pick-and-place scenario. In less than three minutes of exploratory robot motions and less than four additional minutes of computation time, we obtain an accurate model that enables collision-free motions. Our approach is intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible to users without specialized technical knowledge. It is applicable to all types of industrial robots or cobots.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

While recent approaches have attempted to mitigate this through self-supervised representation learning, most either rely on 2D vision pretraining paradigms such as masked image modeling, which primarily focus on static semantics or scene geometry, or utilize large-scale video prediction models that emphasize 2D dynamics, thus failing to jointly learn the geometry, semantics, and dynamics required for effective manipulation. In this paper, we present DynaRend, a representation learning framework that learns 3D-aware and dynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future prediction using differentiable volumetric rendering. By pretraining on multi-view RGB-D video data, DynaRend jointly captures spatial geometry, future dynamics, and task semantics in a unified triplane representation. The learned representations can be effectively transferred to downstream robotic manipulation tasks via action value map prediction. We evaluate DynaRend on two challenging benchmarks, RLBench and Colosseum, as well as in real-world robotic experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in policy success rate, generalization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability across diverse manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Recently, it has gained prominence as the core of foundation models for the physical world, where achieving generalization requires countless demonstrations of a multitude of tasks. Typically, a human expert with full information on the task demonstrates a (nearly) optimal behavior. In this paper, we propose to hide some of the task's information from the demonstrator. This ``blindfolded'' expert is compelled to employ non-trivial exploration to solve the task. We show that cloning the blindfolded expert generalizes better to unseen tasks than its fully-informed counterpart. We conduct experiments of real-world robot peg insertion tasks with (limited) human demonstrations, alongside videogames from the Procgen benchmark. Additionally, we support our findings with theoretical analysis, which confirms that the generalization error scales with $\sqrt{I/m}$, where $I$ measures the amount of task information available to the demonstrator, and $m$ is the number of demonstrated tasks. Both theory and practice indicate that cloning blindfolded experts generalizes better with fewer demonstrated tasks.

In this paper, we present a phase-based trajectory optimization that ensures the feasibility of translational dynamics and friction cone constraints throughout the entire trajectory. Specifically, our approach leverages the superposition properties of linear differential equations to decouple the translational dynamics for each contact point, which operates under different phase sequences. Furthermore, we utilize the differentiation matrix of B{\'e}zier polynomials to derive an analytical relationship between the robot's position and force, thereby ensuring the consistent satisfaction of translational dynamics. Additionally, by exploiting the convex closure property of B{\'e}zier polynomials, our method ensures compliance with friction cone constraints. Using the aforementioned approach, the proposed trajectory optimization framework can generate dynamically reliable motions with various gait sequences for legged robots. We validate our framework using a quadruped robot model, focusing on the feasibility of dynamics and motion generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS.

We propose a framework combining a Language-Conditioned Visual Representation (LCVR) module and a Language-conditioned Mixture-ofExperts Density Policy (LMoE-DP). LCVR resolves perceptual ambiguities by grounding visual features with language instructions, enabling differentiation between visually similar tasks. To mitigate task conflict, LMoE-DP uses a sparse expert architecture to specialize in distinct, multimodal action distributions, stabilized by gradient modulation. On real-robot benchmarks, LCVR boosts Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) and Diffusion Policy (DP) success rates by 33.75% and 25%, respectively. The full framework achieves a 79% average success, outperforming the advanced baseline by 21%. Our work shows that combining semantic grounding and expert specialization enables robust, efficient multi-task manipulation</p></details> | 8 pages |

Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional (2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired robot model. The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, Presented at the 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, Rome, July 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches.

In this paper, we propose an IMU-free and feature-association-free framework to achieve aggressive ego-motion velocity estimation of a robot platform in highly dynamic scenarios by combining two types of exteroceptive sensors, an event camera and a millimeter wave radar, First, we used instantaneous raw events and Doppler measurements to derive rotational and translational velocities directly. Without a sophisticated association process between measurement frames, the proposed method is more robust in texture-less and structureless environments and is more computationally efficient for edge computing devices. Then, in the back-end, we propose a continuous-time state-space model to fuse the hybrid time-based and event-based measurements to estimate the ego-motion velocity in a fixed-lagged smoother fashion. In the end, we validate our velometer framework extensively in self-collected experiment datasets. The results indicate that our IMU-free and association-free ego motion estimation framework can achieve reliable and efficient velocity output in challenging environments.

| **[A Comprehensive General Model of Tendon-Actuated Concentric Tube Robots with Multiple Tubes and Tendons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23954v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tendon-actuated concentric tube mechanisms combine the advantages of tendon-driven continuum robots and concentric tube robots while addressing their respective limitations. They overcome the restricted degrees of freedom often seen in tendon-driven designs, and mitigate issues such as snapping instability associated with concentric tube robots. However, a complete and general mechanical model for these systems remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a Cosserat rod-based framework for modeling the general case of $n$ concentric tubes, each actuated by $m_i$ tendons, where $i = \{1, \ldots, n\}$. The model allows each tube to twist and elongate while enforcing a shared centerline for bending. We validate the proposed framework through experiments with two-tube and three tube assemblies under various tendon routing configurations, achieving tip prediction errors $<4\%$ of the robot's total length. We further demonstrate the model's generality by applying it to existing robots in the field, where maximum tip deviations remain around $5\%$ of the total length. This model provides a foundation for accurate shape estimation and control of advanced tendon-actuated concentric tube robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Flexible Linear Objects in Planar Environments by Two Robot Hands Using Euler's Elastica Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02874v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The manipulation of flexible objects such as cables, wires and fresh food items by robot hands forms a special challenge in robot grasp mechanics. This paper considers the steering of flexible linear objects in planar environments by two robot hands. The flexible linear object, modeled as an elastic non-stretchable rod, is manipulated by varying the gripping endpoint positions while keeping equal endpoint tangents. The flexible linear object shape has a closed form solution in terms of the grasp endpoint positions and tangents, called Euler's elastica. This paper obtains the elastica solutions under the optimal control framework, then uses the elastica solutions to obtain closed-form criteria for non self-intersection, stability and obstacle avoidance of the flexible linear object. The new tools are incorporated into a planning scheme for steering flexible linear objects in planar environments populated by sparsely spaced obstacles. The scheme is fully implemented and demonstrated with detailed examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[RobotArena $\infty$: Scalable Robot Benchmarking via Real-to-Sim Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23571v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing diverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable evaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments. As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify, since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts. Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup, resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's robotics landscape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://robotarenainf.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Data-Driven Soft Robot Control via Adiabatic Spectral Submanifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10919v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mechanical complexity of soft robots creates significant challenges for their model-based control. Specifically, linear data-driven models have struggled to control soft robots on complex, spatially extended paths that explore regions with significant nonlinear behavior. To account for these nonlinearities, we develop here a model-predictive control strategy based on the recent theory of adiabatic spectral submanifolds (aSSMs). This theory is applicable because the internal vibrations of heavily overdamped robots decay at a speed that is much faster than the desired speed of the robot along its intended path. In that case, low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds (aSSMs) emanate from the path and carry the dominant dynamics of the robot. Aided by this recent theory, we devise an aSSM-based model-predictive control scheme purely from data. We demonstrate our data-driven model's effectiveness in tracking dynamic trajectories across diverse tasks, validated on a high-fidelity, high-dimensional finite-element model of a soft trunk robot and a Cosserat rod-based elastic soft arm. Notably, we find that five- or six-dimensional aSSM-reduced models outperform the tracking performance of other data-driven modeling methods by a factor up to $10$ across all closed-loop control tasks.</p></details> | 41 pages, 24 figures |

This lack of spatial awareness causes collisions, system recoveries, and workflow disruptions, issues that will intensify with the introduction of distributed robots with independent interacting arms. Existing tracking systems rely on bulky infrared cameras and reflective markers, providing only limited views of the surgical scene and adding hardware burden in crowded operating rooms. We present a marker-free proprioception method that enables precise localisation of surgical robots under their sterile draping despite associated obstruction of visual cues. Our method solely relies on lightweight stereo-RGB cameras and novel transformer-based deep learning models. It builds on the largest multi-centre spatial robotic surgery dataset to date (1.4M self-annotated images from human cadaveric and preclinical in vivo studies). By tracking the entire robot and surgical scene, rather than individual markers, our approach provides a holistic view robust to occlusions, supporting surgical scene understanding and context-aware control. We demonstrate an example of potential clinical benefits during in vivo breathing compensation with access to tissue dynamics, unobservable under state of the art tracking, and accurately locate in multi-robot systems for future intelligent interaction. In addition, and compared with existing systems, our method eliminates markers and improves tracking visibility by 25%. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of marker-free proprioception for fully draped surgical robots, reducing setup complexity, enhancing safety, and paving the way toward modular and autonomous robotic surgery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deductive Chain-of-Thought Augmented Socially-aware Robot Navigation World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23509v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces. However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical grounding and weak logical consistency. In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a multi-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space, collision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling interpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded environments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation.

Although humanoid robots have been extensively studied for decades, a majority of existing humanoid robots still heavily rely on complex modular frameworks, leading to inflexibility and potential compounded errors from independent sensing, planning, and acting components. In response, we propose an end-to-end humanoid sense-plan-act walking system, enabling vision-based obstacle avoidance and footstep planning for whole body balancing simultaneously. We designed two imperative learning (IL)-based bilevel optimizations for model-predictive step planning and whole body balancing, respectively, to achieve self-supervised learning for humanoid robot walking. This enables the robot to learn from arbitrary unlabeled data, improving its adaptability and generalization capabilities. We refer to our method as iWalker and demonstrate its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments, representing a significant advancement toward autonomous humanoid robots.</p></details> |  |

But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1) are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location; 2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple example of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi.

At the sensing level, several novel tactile sensors have been developed, capable of providing accurate contact information. On a methodological level, learning from demonstrations has proven an efficient paradigm to obtain performant robotic manipulation policies. The combination of both holds the promise to extract crucial contact-related information from the demonstration data and actively exploit it during policy rollouts. However, this integration has so far been underexplored, most notably in dynamic, contact-rich manipulation tasks where precision and reactivity are essential. This work therefore proposes a multimodal, visuotactile imitation learning framework that integrates a modular transformer architecture with a flow-based generative model, enabling efficient learning of fast and dexterous manipulation policies. We evaluate our framework on the dynamic, contact-rich task of robotic match lighting - a task in which tactile feedback influences human manipulation performance. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our approach and show that adding tactile information improves policy performance, thereby underlining their combined potential for learning dynamic manipulation from few demonstrations.

Exploring the Role of Robots' Value Awareness in a Decision-Making Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23204v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates whether the opinions of robotic agents are more likely to influence human decision-making when the robots are perceived as value-aware (i.e., when they display an understanding of human principles). We designed an experiment in which participants interacted with two Furhat robots - one programmed to be Value-Aware and the other Non-Value-Aware - during a labeling task for images representing human values. Results indicate that participants distinguished the Value-Aware robot from the Non-Value-Aware one. Although their explicit choices did not indicate a clear preference for one robot over the other, participants directed their gaze more toward the Value-Aware robot. Additionally, the Value-Aware robot was perceived as more loyal, suggesting that value awareness in a social robot may enhance its perceived commitment to the group. Finally, when both robots disagreed with the participant, conformity occurred in about one out of four trials, and participants took longer to confirm their responses, suggesting that two robots expressing dissent may introduce hesitation in decision-making. On one hand, this highlights the potential risk that robots, if misused, could manipulate users for unethical purposes. On the other hand, it reinforces the idea that social robots might encourage reflection in ambiguous situations and help users avoid scams.</p></details> |  |

We address this with a reinforcement learning approach in which policies jointly select control actions and their application durations, enabling robots to autonomously modulate their control frequency in response to situational demands. We validate our method with zero-shot sim-to-real experiments on two distinct hardware platforms: a high-speed RC car and a quadrupedal robot.

Existing approaches often fail to achieve efficiency and accuracy in such tasks. To fill the research gap, this paper studies the small-scale and high-precision granular material digging task with unknown physical properties. A new framework, named differentiable digging robot (DDBot), is proposed to manipulate granular materials, including sand and soil. Specifically, we equip DDBot with a differentiable physics-based simulator, tailored for granular material manipulation, powered by GPU-accelerated parallel computing and automatic differentiation. DDBot can perform efficient differentiable system identification and high-precision digging skill optimisation for unknown granular materials, which is enabled by a differentiable skill-to-action mapping, a task-oriented demonstration method, gradient clipping and line search-based gradient descent. Experimental results show that DDBot can efficiently (converge within 5 to 20 minutes) identify unknown granular material dynamics and optimise digging skills, with high-precision results in zero-shot real-world deployments, highlighting its practicality. Benchmark results against state-of-the-art baselines also confirm the robustness and efficiency of DDBot in such digging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a regular paper by the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

This paper presents a two-layer framework that combines high-level scheduling with low-level control. Tasks are assigned and scheduled using the compositional algorithm ComSat, which generates time-parameterized routes for each robot. These schedules are then used by a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) system in real time to compute local reference trajectories, accounting for static and dynamic obstacles. The approach ensures safe, collision-free operation, and supports rapid rescheduling in response to disruptions such as robot failures or environmental changes. We evaluate the method in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic conditions, demonstrating high task completion rates and robust behavior even under congestion. The modular structure of the framework allows for computational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for deployment in complex, real-world industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Robotic Task Execution in the Face of Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23121v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned robot policies have consistently been shown to be versatile, but they typically have no built-in mechanism for handling the complexity of open environments, making them prone to execution failures; this implies that deploying policies without the ability to recognise and react to failures may lead to unreliable and unsafe robot behaviour. In this paper, we present a framework that couples a learned policy with a method to detect visual anomalies during policy deployment and to perform recovery behaviours when necessary, thereby aiming to prevent failures. Specifically, we train an anomaly detection model using data collected during nominal executions of a trained policy. This model is then integrated into the online policy execution process, so that deviations from the nominal execution can trigger a three-level sequential recovery process that consists of (i) pausing the execution temporarily, (ii) performing a local perturbation of the robot's state, and (iii) resetting the robot to a safe state by sampling from a learned execution success model. We verify our proposed method in two different scenarios: (i) a door handle reaching task with a Kinova Gen3 arm using a policy trained in simulation and transferred to the real robot, and (ii) an object placing task with a UFactory xArm 6 using a general-purpose policy model. Our results show that integrating policy execution with anomaly detection and recovery increases the execution success rate in environments with various anomalies, such as trajectory deviations and adversarial human interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Awakening Facial Emotional Expressions in Human-Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23059v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The facial expression generation capability of humanoid social robots is critical for achieving natural and human-like interactions, playing a vital role in enhancing the fluidity of human-robot interactions and the accuracy of emotional expression. Currently, facial expression generation in humanoid social robots still relies on pre-programmed behavioral patterns, which are manually coded at high human and time costs. To enable humanoid robots to autonomously acquire generalized expressive capabilities, they need to develop the ability to learn human-like expressions through self-training. To address this challenge, we have designed a highly biomimetic robotic face with physical-electronic animated facial units and developed an end-to-end learning framework based on KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) and attention mechanisms. Unlike previous humanoid social robots, we have also meticulously designed an automated data collection system based on expert strategies of facial motion primitives to construct the dataset. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-source facial dataset for humanoid social robots. Comprehensive evaluations indicate that our approach achieves accurate and diverse facial mimicry across different test subjects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025). 8 pages, 7 figures, IEEE two-column format</p></details> |
| **[Seq-DeepIPC: Sequential Sensing for End-to-End Control in Legged Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23057v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Seq-DeepIPC, a sequential end-to-end perception-to-control model for legged robot navigation in realworld environments. Seq-DeepIPC advances intelligent sensing for autonomous legged navigation by tightly integrating multi-modal perception (RGB-D + GNSS) with temporal fusion and control. The model jointly predicts semantic segmentation and depth estimation, giving richer spatial features for planning and control. For efficient deployment on edge devices, we use EfficientNet-B0 as the encoder, reducing computation while maintaining accuracy. Heading estimation is simplified by removing the noisy IMU and instead computing the bearing angle directly from consecutive GNSS positions. We collected a larger and more diverse dataset that includes both road and grass terrains, and validated Seq-DeepIPC on a robot dog. Comparative and ablation studies show that sequential inputs improve perception and control in our models, while other baselines do not benefit. Seq-DeepIPC achieves competitive or better results with reasonable model size; although GNSS-only heading is less reliable near tall buildings, it is robust in open areas. Overall, Seq-DeepIPC extends end-to-end navigation beyond wheeled robots to more versatile and temporally-aware systems. To support future research, we will release the codes to our GitHub repository at https://github.com/oskarnatan/Seq-DeepIPC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint notice, this manuscript has been submitted to IEEE sensors journal for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Lazy-DaSH: Lazy Approach for Hypergraph-based Multi-robot Task and Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05552v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Lazy-DaSH, an improvement over the recent state of the art multi-robot task and motion planning method DaSH, which scales to more than double the number of robots and objects compared to the original method and achieves an order of magnitude faster planning time when applied to a multi-manipulator object rearrangement problem. We achieve this improvement through a hierarchical approach, where a high-level task planning layer identifies planning spaces required for task completion, and motion feasibility is validated lazily only within these spaces. In contrast, DaSH precomputes the motion feasibility of all possible actions, resulting in higher costs for constructing state space representations. Lazy-DaSH maintains efficient query performance by utilizing a constraint feedback mechanism within its hierarchical structure, ensuring that motion feasibility is effectively conveyed to the query process. By maintaining smaller state space representations, our method significantly reduces both representation construction time and query time. We evaluate Lazy-DaSH in four distinct scenarios, demonstrating its scalability to increasing numbers of robots and objects, as well as its adaptability in resolving conflicts through the constraint feedback mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Language Models for Semantic Navigation and Manipulation in an Aerial-Ground Robotic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05020v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous multirobot systems show great potential in complex tasks requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, existing methods that rely on static or task-specific models often lack generalizability across diverse tasks and dynamic environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical multimodal framework that integrates a prompted large language model (LLM) with a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM). At the system level, the LLM performs hierarchical task decomposition and constructs a global semantic map, while the VLM provides semantic perception and object localization, where the proposed GridMask significantly enhances the VLM's spatial accuracy for reliable fine-grained manipulation. The aerial robot leverages this global map to generate semantic paths and guide the ground robot's local navigation and manipulation, ensuring robust coordination even in target-absent or ambiguous scenarios. We validate the framework through extensive simulation and real-world experiments on long-horizon object arrangement tasks, demonstrating zero-shot adaptability, robust semantic navigation, and reliable manipulation in dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first heterogeneous aerial-ground robotic system that integrates VLM-based perception with LLM-driven reasoning for global high-level task planning and execution.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

Instead of relying on task-specific robot demonstrations collected via teleoperation, HAND uses easy-to-provide hand demonstrations to retrieve relevant behaviors from task-agnostic robot play data. Using a visual tracking pipeline, HAND extracts the motion of the human hand from the hand demonstration and retrieves robot sub-trajectories in two stages: first filtering by visual similarity, then retrieving trajectories with similar behaviors to the hand. Fine-tuning a policy on the retrieved data enables real-time learning of tasks in under four minutes, without requiring calibrated cameras or detailed hand pose estimation. Experiments also show that HAND outperforms retrieval baselines by over 2x in average task success rates on real robots.

| **[Kinematically Controllable Cable Robots with Reconfigurable End-effectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22825v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enlarge the translational workspace of cable-driven robots, one common approach is to increase the number of cables. However, this introduces two challenges: (1) cable interference significantly reduces the rotational workspace, and (2) the solution of tensions in cables becomes non-unique, resulting in difficulties for kinematic control of the robot. In this work, we design structurally simple reconfigurable end-effectors for cable robots. By incorporating a spring, a helical-grooved shaft, and a matching nut, relative linear motions between end-effector components are converted into relative rotations, thereby expanding the rotational workspace of the mechanism. Meanwhile, a bearing is introduced to provide an additional rotational degree of freedom, making the mechanism non-redundant. As a result, the robot's motion can be controlled purely through kinematics without additional tension sensing and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 12 figures, Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[PIP-LLM: Integrating PDDL-Integer Programming with LLMs for Coordinating Multi-Robot Teams Using Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22784v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robot teams to execute natural language commands requires translating high-level instructions into feasible, efficient multi-robot plans. While Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Planning Domain Description Language (PDDL) offer promise for single-robot scenarios, existing approaches struggle with multi-robot coordination due to brittle task decomposition, poor scalability, and low coordination efficiency. We introduce PIP-LLM, a language-based coordination framework that consists of PDDL-based team-level planning and Integer Programming (IP) based robot-level planning. PIP-LLMs first decomposes the command by translating the command into a team-level PDDL problem and solves it to obtain a team-level plan, abstracting away robot assignment. Each team-level action represents a subtask to be finished by the team. Next, this plan is translated into a dependency graph representing the subtasks' dependency structure. Such a dependency graph is then used to guide the robot-level planning, in which each subtask node will be formulated as an IP-based task allocation problem, explicitly optimizing travel costs and workload while respecting robot capabilities and user-defined constraints. This separation of planning from assignment allows PIP-LLM to avoid the pitfalls of syntax-based decomposition and scale to larger teams. Experiments across diverse tasks show that PIP-LLM improves plan success rate, reduces maximum and average travel costs, and achieves better load balancing compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policies over Poses: Reinforcement Learning based Distributed Pose-Graph Optimization for Multi-Robot SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22740v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the distributed pose-graph optimization (PGO) problem, which is fundamental in accurate trajectory estimation in multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Conventional iterative approaches linearize a highly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal equations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal estimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed PGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where each action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner decomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent edge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating to denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid policy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local graph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to produce a globally consistent estimate. Our extensive evaluations on a comprehensive suite of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our learned MARL-based actors reduce the global objective by an average of 37.5% more than the state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, while enhancing inference efficiency by at least 6X. We also demonstrate that actor replication allows a single learned policy to scale effortlessly to substantially larger robot teams without any retraining.

| **[Stability Criteria and Motor Performance in Delayed Haptic Dyadic Interactions Mediated by Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14511v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper establishes analytical stability criteria for robot-mediated human-human (dyadic) interaction systems, focusing on haptic communication under network-induced time delays. Through frequency-domain analysis supported by numerical simulations, we identify both delay-independent and delay-dependent stability criteria. The delay-independent criterion guarantees stability irrespective of the delay, whereas the delay-dependent criterion is characterised by a maximum tolerable delay before instability occurs. The criteria demonstrate dependence on controller and robot dynamic parameters, where increasing stiffness reduces the maximum tolerable delay in a non-linear manner, thereby heightening system vulnerability. The proposed criteria can be generalised to a wide range of robot-mediated interactions and serve as design guidelines for stable remote dyadic systems. Experiments with robots performing human-like movements further illustrate the correlation between stability and motor performance. The findings of this paper suggest the prerequisites for effective delay-compensation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pretraining a Unified PDDL Domain from Real-World Demonstrations for Generalizable Robot Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21545v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic task planning in real-world environments requires reasoning over implicit constraints from language and vision. While LLMs and VLMs offer strong priors, they struggle with long-horizon structure and symbolic grounding. Existing methods that combine LLMs with symbolic planning often rely on handcrafted or narrow domains, limiting generalization. We propose UniDomain, a framework that pre-trains a PDDL domain from robot manipulation demonstrations and applies it for online robotic task planning. It extracts atomic domains from 12,393 manipulation videos to form a unified domain with 3137 operators, 2875 predicates, and 16481 causal edges. Given a target class of tasks, it retrieves relevant atomics from the unified domain and systematically fuses them into high-quality meta-domains to support compositional generalization in planning. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks show that UniDomain solves complex, unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner, achieving up to 58% higher task success and 160% improvement in plan optimality over state-of-the-art LLM and LLM-PDDL baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[On Steerability Factors for Growing Vine Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22504v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vine robots extend their tubular bodies by everting material from the tip, enabling navigation in complex environments with a minimalist soft body. Despite their promise for field applications, especially in the urban search and rescue domain, performance is constrained by the weight of attached sensors or tools, as well as other design and control choices. This work investigates how tip load, pressure, length, diameter, and fabrication method shape vine robot steerability--the ability to maneuver with controlled curvature--for robots that steer with series pouch motor-style pneumatic actuators. We conduct two groups of experiments: (1) studying tip load, chamber pressure, length, and diameter in a robot supporting itself against gravity, and (2) studying fabrication method and ratio of actuator to chamber pressure in a robot supported on the ground. Results show that steerability decreases with increasing tip load, is best at moderate chamber pressure, increases with length, and is largely unaffected by diameter. Robots with actuators attached on their exterior begin curving at low pressure ratios, but curvature saturates at high pressure ratios; those with actuators integrated into the robot body require higher pressure ratios to begin curving but achieve higher curvature overall. We demonstrate that robots optimized with these principles outperform those with ad hoc parameters in a mobility task that involves maximizing upward and horizontal curvatures.</p></details> |  |

Unlike other areas of research, the scientific community has not yet achieved an agreement on how Social Robot Navigation should be benchmarked.

Motivated by this gap, we contribute with a short review focused exclusively on benchmarking trends in the period from January 2020 to July 2025. Of the 130 papers identified by our search using IEEE Xplore, we analysed the 85 papers that met the criteria of the review.

| **[Separation of Unconscious Robots with Obstructed Visibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22434v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a recently introduced \textit{unconscious} mobile robot model, where each robot is associated with a \textit{color}, which is visible to other robots but not to itself. The robots are autonomous, anonymous, oblivious and silent, operating in the Euclidean plane under the conventional \textit{Look-Compute-Move} cycle. A primary task in this model is the \textit{separation problem}, where unconscious robots sharing the same color must separate from others, forming recognizable geometric shapes such as circles, points, or lines. All prior works model the robots as \textit{transparent}, enabling each to know the positions and colors of all other robots. In contrast, we model the robots as \textit{opaque}, where a robot can obstruct the visibility of two other robots, if it lies on the line segment between them. Under this obstructed visibility, we consider a variant of the separation problem in which robots, starting from any arbitrary initial configuration, are required to separate into concentric semicircles. We present a collision-free algorithm that solves the separation problem under a semi-synchronous scheduler in $O(n)$ epochs, where $n$ is the number of robots. The robots agree on one coordinate axis but have no knowledge of $n$.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method introduces a spatiotemporal neural network architecture that fuses multi-modal inputs, including current and historical tendon displacement data and RGB images, to generate point clouds representing the robot's deformed configuration. The network integrates a recurrent neural module for temporal feature extraction, an encoding module for spatial feature extraction, and a multi-modal fusion module to combine spatial features extracted from visual data with temporal dependencies from historical actuator inputs. Continuous 3D shape reconstruction is achieved by fitting B\'ezier curves to the predicted point clouds. Experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves high precision, with mean shape estimation errors of 0.08 mm (unloaded) and 0.22 mm (loaded), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in shape sensing for TDCRs. The results validate the efficacy of deep learning-based spatiotemporal data fusion for precise shape estimation under loading conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[Prognostic Framework for Robotic Manipulators Operating Under Dynamic Task Severities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00538v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulators are critical in many applications but are known to degrade over time. This degradation is influenced by the nature of the tasks performed by the robot. Tasks with higher severity, such as handling heavy payloads, can accelerate the degradation process. One way this degradation is reflected is in the position accuracy of the robot's end-effector. In this paper, we present a prognostic modeling framework that predicts a robotic manipulator's Remaining Useful Life (RUL) while accounting for the effects of task severity. Our framework represents the robot's position accuracy as a Brownian motion process with a random drift parameter that is influenced by task severity. The dynamic nature of task severity is modeled using a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). To evaluate RUL, we discuss two approaches -- (1) a novel closed-form expression for Remaining Lifetime Distribution (RLD), and (2) Monte Carlo simulations, commonly used in prognostics literature. Theoretical results establish the equivalence between these RUL computation approaches. We validate our framework through experiments using two distinct physics-based simulators for planar and spatial robot fleets. Our findings show that robots in both fleets experience shorter RUL when handling a higher proportion of high-severity tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems</p></details> |

For the interactions to be seamless, the agents need to analyse social scenes and behavioural cues from their (robot's) perspective. Works that model human-agent interactions in social situations are few; and even those existing ones are computationally too intensive to be deployed in real time or perform poorly in real-world scenarios when only limited information is available. We propose a knowledge distillation framework that models social interactions through various multimodal cues, and yet is robust against incomplete and noisy information during inference. We train a teacher model with multimodal input (body, face and hand gestures, gaze, raw images) that transfers knowledge to a student model which relies solely on body pose. Extensive experiments on two publicly available human-robot interaction datasets demonstrate that our student model achieves an average accuracy gain of 14.75% over competitive baselines on multiple downstream social understanding tasks, even with up to 51% of its input being corrupted. The student model is also highly efficient - less than 1% in size of the teacher model in terms of parameters and its latency is 11.9% of the teacher model.

In general, we must construct such a 3D interpretation of a complex scene based on limited input, such as a single RGB-D image. We describe SceneComplete, a system for constructing a complete, segmented, 3D model of a scene from a single view. SceneComplete is a novel pipeline for composing general-purpose pretrained perception modules (vision-language, segmentation, image-inpainting, image-to-3D, visual-descriptors and pose-estimation) to obtain highly accurate results. We demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness with respect to ground-truth models in a large benchmark dataset and show that its accurate whole-object reconstruction enables robust grasp proposal generation, including for a dexterous hand.

However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

While diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and video generation, many of their inference strategies have been directly transferred to control domains without adaptation. In this work, we show that by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied AI tasks -- particularly structured, low-dimensional nature of action distributions -- diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as 5 neural function evaluations (NFE). Building on this insight, we propose a population-based sampling strategy, genetic denoising, which enhances both performance and stability by selecting denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk. Our method solves challenging tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. We evaluate our approach across 14 robotic manipulation tasks from D4RL and Robomimic, spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets. In over 2 million evaluations, our method consistently outperforms standard diffusion-based policies, achieving up to 20\% performance gains with significantly fewer inference steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figure, 2 tables, accepted at Neurips 2025</p></details> |

Firstly, the localization scenarios and the problem model are analyzed. An integrated architecture of Attention Mechanism-based Fusion Algorithm (AMFA) incorporating planar array Ultra-Wideband (UWB), GPS, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and barometer is designed to handle challenges such as GPS occlusion and UWB Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) problem. Then, End-to-end neural network inference models for UWB and barometer are developed, along with a multimodal attention mechanism for adaptive data fusion. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is applied to refine the trajectory, improving accuracy and robustness. Finally, real-world experiments show that the method achieves 0.48 m localization accuracy and lower MAX error of 1.50 m, outperforming baseline algorithms such as GPS/INS-EKF and demonstrating stronger robustness.</p></details> |  |

Despite its potential, the efficacy of tactile sensing in reinforcement learning (RL) remains inconsistent. We address this by developing self-supervised learning (SSL) methodologies to more effectively harness tactile observations, focusing on a scalable setup of proprioception and sparse binary contacts. We empirically demonstrate that sparse binary tactile signals are critical for dexterity, particularly for interactions that proprioceptive control errors do not register, such as decoupled robot-object motions. Our agents achieve superhuman dexterity in complex contact tasks (ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation). Furthermore, we find that decoupling the SSL memory from the on-policy memory can improve performance. We release the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark to standardise and promote future research in tactile-based manipulation.

Treating human hand as dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion. We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data. We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable embodied intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://microsoft.github.io/VITRA/</p></details> |

This paper shows how resilience is a fundamental characteristic of social robots, which, through it, ensure trust in the robot itself-an essential element especially when operating in contexts with elderly people, who often have low trust in these systems. Resilience is therefore the ability to operate under adverse or stressful conditions, even when degraded or weakened, while maintaining essential operational capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Workshop on Adaptive Social Interaction based on user's Mental mOdels and behaVior in HRI, The 17th International Conference on Social Robotics, 10-12 September 2025, Naples (IT)</p></details> |
| **[PREVENT: Proactive Risk Evaluation and Vigilant Execution of Tasks for Mobile Robotic Chemists using Multi-Modal Behavior Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21438v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robotic chemists are a fast growing trend in the field of chemistry and materials research. However, so far these mobile robots lack workflow awareness skills. This poses the risk that even a small anomaly, such as an improperly capped sample vial could disrupt the entire workflow. This wastes time, and resources, and could pose risks to human researchers, such as exposure to toxic materials. Existing perception mechanisms can be used to predict anomalies but they often generate excessive false positives. This may halt workflow execution unnecessarily, requiring researchers to intervene and to resume the workflow when no problem actually exists, negating the benefits of autonomous operation. To address this problem, we propose PREVENT a system comprising navigation and manipulation skills based on a multimodal Behavior Tree (BT) approach that can be integrated into existing software architectures with minimal modifications. Our approach involves a hierarchical perception mechanism that exploits AI techniques and sensory feedback through Dexterous Vision and Navigational Vision cameras and an IoT gas sensor module for execution-related decision-making. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach is comparatively efficient and completely avoids both false negatives and false positives when tested in simulated risk scenarios within our robotic chemistry workflow. The results also show that the proposed multi-modal perception skills achieved deployment accuracies that were higher than the average of the corresponding uni-modal skills, both for navigation and for manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 8 figures, paper submitted to Robotics and Autonomous Systems Journal</p></details> |

However, existing imitation learning datasets contain only successful trajectories and lack failure or recovery data, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) states where the robot deviates from the main policy due to minor perturbations or errors, leading VLA models to struggle with states deviating from the training distribution. To this end, we propose an automated OOD data augmentation framework named RESample through exploratory sampling. Specifically, we first leverage offline reinforcement learning to obtain an action-value network that accurately identifies sub-optimal actions under the current manipulation policy. We further sample potential OOD states from trajectories via rollout, and design an exploratory sampling mechanism that adaptively incorporates these action proxies into the training dataset to ensure efficiency. Subsequently, our framework explicitly encourages the VLAs to recover from OOD states and enhances their robustness against distributional shifts. We conduct extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark as well as real-world robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating that RESample consistently improves the stability and generalization ability of VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,7 figures, submitted to ICRA2026</p></details> |
| **[Load-bearing Assessment for Safe Locomotion of Quadruped Robots on Collapsing Terrain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21369v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collapsing terrains, often present in search and rescue missions or planetary exploration, pose significant challenges for quadruped robots. This paper introduces a robust locomotion framework for safe navigation over unstable surfaces by integrating terrain probing, load-bearing analysis, motion planning, and control strategies. Unlike traditional methods that rely on specialized sensors or external terrain mapping alone, our approach leverages joint measurements to assess terrain stability without hardware modifications. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) system optimizes robot motion, balancing stability and probing constraints, while a state machine coordinates terrain probing actions, enabling the robot to detect collapsible regions and dynamically adjust its footholds. Experimental results on custom-made collapsing platforms and rocky terrains demonstrate the framework's ability to traverse collapsing terrain while maintaining stability and prioritizing safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmenting Neural Networks-Based Model Approximators in Robotic Force-Tracking Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08440v3)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robotics gains popularity, interaction control becomes crucial for ensuring force tracking in manipulator-based tasks. Typically, traditional interaction controllers either require extensive tuning, or demand expert knowledge of the environment, which is often impractical in real-world applications. This work proposes a novel control strategy leveraging Neural Networks (NNs) to enhance the force-tracking behavior of a Direct Force Controller (DFC). Unlike similar previous approaches, it accounts for the manipulator's tangential velocity, a critical factor in force exertion, especially during fast motions. The method employs an ensemble of feedforward NNs to predict contact forces, then exploits the prediction to solve an optimization problem and generate an optimal residual action, which is added to the DFC output and applied to an impedance controller. The proposed Velocity-augmented Artificial intelligence Interaction Controller for Ambiguous Models (VAICAM) is validated in the Gazebo simulator on a Franka Emika Panda robot. Against a vast set of trajectories, VAICAM achieves superior performance compared to two baseline controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics - Volume 2: ICINCO, 394-401, 2025 , Marbella, Spain</p></details> |

We build on our previous hardware-agnostic actuator synchronization in Motion Stack to develop a new controller enforcing adaptive velocity bounds via a dynamic hypersphere clamp. Using only real-time end-effector and target pose measurements, the controller adjusts its translational and rotational speed limits to ensure smooth, stable alignment without abrupt motions. We implemented two variants, a discrete, step-based version and a continuous, velocity-based version, and tested them on two MoonBot limbs in JAXA's lunar environment simulator. Field trials demonstrate that the step-based variant produces highly predictable, low-wobble motions, while the continuous variant converges more quickly and maintains millimeter-level positional accuracy, and both remain robust across limbs with differing mechanical imperfections and sensing noise (e.g., backlash and flex). These results highlight the flexibility and robustness of our robot-agnostic framework for autonomous self-assembly and reconfiguration under harsh conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Sequentially Teaching Sequential Tasks $(ST)^2$: Teaching Robots Long-horizon Manipulation Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21046v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from demonstration is effective for teaching robots complex skills with high sample efficiency. However, teaching long-horizon tasks with multiple skills is difficult, as deviations accumulate, distributional shift increases, and human teachers become fatigued, raising the chance of failure. In this work, we study user responses to two teaching frameworks: (i) a traditional monolithic approach, where users demonstrate the entire trajectory of a long-horizon task; and (ii) a sequential approach, where the task is segmented by the user and demonstrations are provided step by step. To support this study, we introduce $(ST)^2$, a sequential method for learning long-horizon manipulation tasks that allows users to control the teaching flow by defining key points, enabling incremental and structured demonstrations. We conducted a user study on a restocking task with 16 participants in a realistic retail environment to evaluate both user preference and method effectiveness. Our objective and subjective results show that both methods achieve similar trajectory quality and success rates. Some participants preferred the sequential approach for its iterative control, while others favored the monolithic approach for its simplicity.</p></details> |  |

The system consists of four modules. The first module is a data collection module that is designed to collect human demonstration videos from the point of view of a robot using an AR headset. The second module is a video understanding module that detects objects and extracts 3D human-hand trajectories from demonstration videos. The third module transfers a human-hand trajectory into a reference trajectory of a robot end-effector in 3D space. The last module utilizes a trajectory optimization algorithm to solve a trajectory in the robot configuration space that can follow the end-effector trajectory transferred from the human demonstration. Consequently, these modules enable a robot to watch a human demonstration video once and then repeat the same mobile manipulation task in different environments, even when objects are placed differently from the demonstrations. Experiments of different manipulation tasks are conducted on a mobile manipulator to verify the effectiveness of our system</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures and 3 tables.

Our framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real policy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering of diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian Scene Description File), that infuses Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with robot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1) learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data collection by virtual teleoperation, and (5) zero-shot sim2real visual reinforcement learning.

Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends, uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive results across each analyzed topic.

Many such achievements have been driven by the extensive use of simulation as a critical tool for training and testing robotic systems prior to their deployment in real-world environments. However, simulations consist of abstractions and approximations that inevitably introduce discrepancies between simulated and real environments, known as the reality gap. These discrepancies significantly hinder the successful transfer of systems from simulation to the real world. Closing this gap remains one of the most pressing challenges in robotics. Recent advances in sim-to-real transfer have demonstrated promising results across various platforms, including locomotion, navigation, and manipulation. By leveraging techniques such as domain randomization, real-to-sim transfer, state and action abstractions, and sim-real co-training, many works have overcome the reality gap. However, challenges persist, and a deeper understanding of the reality gap's root causes and solutions is necessary. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the sim-to-real landscape, highlighting the causes, solutions, and evaluation metrics for the reality gap and sim-to-real transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication as part of the Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems 2026</p></details> |
| **[ROPES: Robotic Pose Estimation via Score-Based Causal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20884v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal representation learning (CRL) has emerged as a powerful unsupervised framework that (i) disentangles the latent generative factors underlying high-dimensional data, and (ii) learns the cause-and-effect interactions among the disentangled variables. Despite extensive recent advances in identifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between theory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap by bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically, this paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of position and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES embodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative factors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic latent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background, and camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the controllable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated (intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that variables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In robotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various joints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the ground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional changes, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison with a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This paper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical testbed for CRL.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary version of this paper appeared at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Embodied World Models for Decision Making</p></details> |

However, real tactile sensors often face hardware limitations such as high costs and fragility, and deployment challenges involving calibration and variations between different sensors, while vision-only policies struggle with satisfactory performance. Inspired by humans' ability to infer tactile states from vision, we propose ViTacGen, a novel robot manipulation framework designed for visual robotic pushing with vision-to-touch generation in reinforcement learning to eliminate the reliance on high-resolution real tactile sensors, enabling effective zero-shot deployment on visual-only robotic systems. Specifically, ViTacGen consists of an encoder-decoder vision-to-touch generation network that generates contact depth images, a standardized tactile representation, directly from visual image sequence, followed by a reinforcement learning policy that fuses visual-tactile data with contrastive learning based on visual and generated tactile observations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in both simulation and real world experiments, demonstrating its superior performance and achieving a success rate of up to 86\%.</p></details> |  |

By designing a decentralized control barrier function, we derived sufficient conditions under which local safety constraints guarantee global safety. We account for localization and motion noise explicitly by modeling robots as spatial probability density functions governed by the Fokker-Planck equation. Compared to traditional centralized approaches, our controller requires less computational and communication power, making it more suitable for deployment in situations where perfect communication and localization are impractical. The controller is validated through simulations and experiments with four quadcopters.</p></details> | Accepted to MRS 2025 |

While complementary sensors mitigate individual degradations, carrying all the available sensor types on a single robot significantly increases the size, weight, and power demands. Distributing sensors across multiple robots enhances the deployability but introduces challenges in fusing asynchronous, multi-modal data from independently moving platforms. We propose a novel adaptive multi-modal multi-robot cooperative localization approach using a factor-graph formulation to fuse asynchronous Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), and 3D inter-robot detections from distinct robots in a loosely-coupled fashion. The approach adapts to changing conditions, leveraging reliable data to assist robots affected by sensory degradations. A novel interpolation-based factor enables fusion of the unsynchronized measurements. LIO degradations are evaluated based on the approximate scan-matching Hessian. A novel approach of weighting odometry data proportionally to the Wasserstein distance between the consecutive VIO outputs is proposed. A theoretical analysis is provided, investigating the cooperative localization problem under various conditions, mainly in the presence of sensory degradations. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on real-world data gathered with heterogeneous teams of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), showing that the approach provides significant improvements in localization accuracy in the presence of various sensory degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This approach is beneficial if it is easier to move the part rather than moving the tool. Whether a mathematical description that defines the shape to be processed or single points from a design program are used, the robot path is finally represented using B-splines. The use of splines enables the path to be continuous with a desired degree, which finally leads to a smooth robot trajectory. While calculating the robot trajectory through prescribed orientation, additionally a given velocity at the TCP has to be considered. The procedure was validated on a real system using an industrial robot moving an arbitrary defined part.</p></details> |  |

The reaction torque indicator (RTI) overlays a color and length-coded torque bar in the MR-HMD, enabling seamless integration of visual and haptic feedback during underwater robot arm teleoperation. User studies with sixteen participants compared MR-UBi against a bilateral-control baseline. MR-UBi significantly improved grasping-torque control accuracy, increasing the time within the optimal torque range and reducing both low and high grasping torque range during lift and pick-and-place tasks with objects of different stiffness. Subjective evaluations further showed higher usability (SUS) and lower workload (NASA--TLX). Overall, the results confirm that \textit{MR-UBi} enables more stable, accurate, and user-friendly underwater robot-arm teleoperation through the integration of visual and haptic feedback.
