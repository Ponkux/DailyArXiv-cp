| **[Embodied Arena: A Comprehensive, Unified, and Evolving Evaluation Platform for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15273v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI development significantly lags behind large foundation models due to three critical challenges: (1) lack of systematic understanding of core capabilities needed for Embodied AI, making research lack clear objectives; (2) absence of unified and standardized evaluation systems, rendering cross-benchmark evaluation infeasible; and (3) underdeveloped automated and scalable acquisition methods for embodied data, creating critical bottlenecks for model scaling. To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25 fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view), providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially, we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the leaderboards of Embodied Arena. This helps to establish clear research veins and pinpoint critical research problems, thereby driving forward progress in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, Embodied Arena Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[VIR-Bench: Evaluating Geospatial and Temporal Understanding of MLLMs via Travel Video Itinerary Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19002v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmbodiedSplat: Personalized Real-to-Sim-to-Real Navigation with Gaussian Splats from a Mobile Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17430v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Embodied AI predominantly relies on simulation for training and evaluation, often using either fully synthetic environments that lack photorealism or high-fidelity real-world reconstructions captured with expensive hardware. As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate improvements of 20% and 40% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover, our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87-0.97) for the reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to diverse environments with minimal effort.

| **[Elevating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs with Auxiliary Embedding Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09585v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, the standard practice for developing MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/visper_lm/</p></details> |
| **[Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16176v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories (ACDC), an autonomous drone cinematography system driven by natural language communication between human directors and drones. The main limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent, which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models (VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.</p></details> |  |
| **[OptiScene: LLM-driven Indoor Scene Layout Generation via Scaled Human-aligned Data Synthesis and Multi-Stage Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07570v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emulating Human-like Adaptive Vision for Efficient and Flexible Machine Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15333v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition. Code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/AdaptiveNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThinkAct: Vision-Language-Action Reasoning via Reinforced Visual Latent Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16815v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

| **[RealMirror: A Comprehensive, Open-Source Vision-Language-Action Platform for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14687v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition, the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between simulation and the real world. To overcome these obstacles, we propose RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

| **[Embodied Navigation Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12129v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation is a fundamental capability in embodied AI, representing the intelligence required to perceive and interact within physical environments following language instructions. Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pku-epic.github.io/NavFoM-Web/</p></details> |
| **[PANORAMA: The Rise of Omnidirectional Vision in the Embodied AI Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12989v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception, omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems. Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose omnidirectional AI systems in the embodied AI era.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper presents a draft overview of the emerging field of omnidirectional vision in the context of embodied AI</p></details> |
| **[Learning Precise Affordances from Egocentric Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10123v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Affordance, defined as the potential actions that an object offers, is crucial for embodied AI agents. For example, such knowledge directs an agent to grasp a knife by the handle for cutting or by the blade for safe handover. While existing approaches have made notable progress, affordance research still faces three key challenges: data scarcity, poor generalization, and real-world deployment. Specifically, there is a lack of large-scale affordance datasets with precise segmentation maps, existing models struggle to generalize across different domains or novel object and affordance classes, and little work demonstrates deployability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a complete affordance learning system that (1) takes in egocentric videos and outputs precise affordance annotations without human labeling, (2) leverages geometric information and vision foundation models to improve generalization, and (3) introduces a framework that facilitates affordance-oriented robotic manipulation such as tool grasping and robot-to-human tool handover. Experimental results show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by 13.8% in mIoU, and the framework achieves 77.1% successful grasping among 179 trials, including evaluations on seen, unseen classes, and cluttered scenes.

| **[Integrating Prior Observations for Incremental 3D Scene Graph Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11895v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships. While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world, incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g., CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented architecture will be made available at https://github.com/m4renz/incremental-scene-graph-prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 24th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'25)</p></details> |
| **[INGRID: Intelligent Generative Robotic Design Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03842v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[RoboBrain 2.0 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02029v5)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce RoboBrain 2.0, our latest generation of embodied vision-language foundation models, designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents.

| **[Nav-R1: Reasoning and Navigation in Embodied Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10884v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation requires agents to integrate perception, reasoning, and action for robust interaction in complex 3D environments. Existing approaches often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought (CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format, understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its robustness under limited onboard resources. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/Nav-R1.

| **[InternScenes: A Large-scale Simulatable Indoor Scene Dataset with Realistic Layouts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10813v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v6)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |
| **[Boosting Embodied AI Agents through Perception-Generation Disaggregation and Asynchronous Pipeline Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09560v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by 2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and providing high throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling.

Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments.

World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

| **[Generative World Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Reasoning with Vision-Language Models in Ego-Centric Multi-View Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06266v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal Multi-Task (M3T) Federated Foundation Models for Embodied AI: Potentials and Challenges for Edge Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11191v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As embodied AI systems become increasingly multi-modal, personalized, and interactive, they must learn effectively from diverse sensory inputs, adapt continually to user preferences, and operate safely under resource and privacy constraints. These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: multi-modal multi-task foundation models (M3T-FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas federated learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied AI environments. In this vision paper, we introduce multi-modal multi-task federated foundation models (M3T-FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of M3T-FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed training nature of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical deployment dimensions of M3T-FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning, Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for deploying M3T-FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs. Finally, we present a prototype implementation of M3T-FFMs and evaluate their energy and latency performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in IEEE Internet of Things Magazine, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Plan Verification for LLM-Based Embodied Task Completion Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02761v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions, redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout). The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[HLG: Comprehensive 3D Room Construction via Hierarchical Layout Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17832v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication to encourage future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Model Implanting for Test-time Adaptation of Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03956v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models, the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability. In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied AI: Emerging Risks and Opportunities for Policy Action](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00117v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI systems can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. With recent advances in AI models and hardware, EAI systems are becoming increasingly capable across wider operational domains. While EAI systems can offer many benefits, they also pose significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, as well as economic and societal disruption. These risks require urgent attention from policymakers, as existing policies governing industrial robots and autonomous vehicles are insufficient to address the full range of concerns EAI systems present. To help address this issue, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a taxonomy of the physical, informational, economic, and social risks EAI systems pose. Second, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to assess how existing frameworks address these risks and to identify critical gaps. We conclude by offering policy recommendations for the safe and beneficial deployment of EAI systems, such as mandatory testing and certification schemes, clarified liability frameworks, and strategies to manage EAI's potentially transformative economic and societal impacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[ANNIE: Be Careful of Your Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03383v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI) robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety, how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries; (2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with 2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3) ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era.

Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems.

Existing omnidirectional methods achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the \textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories (\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction, and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI.

| **[RobotxR1: Enabling Embodied Robotic Intelligence on Large Language Models through Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03238v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future robotic systems operating in real-world environments will require on-board embodied intelligence without continuous cloud connection, balancing capabilities with constraints on computational power and memory. This work presents an extension of the R1-zero approach, which enables the usage of low parameter-count Large Language Models (LLMs) in the robotic domain. The R1-Zero approach was originally developed to enable mathematical reasoning in LLMs using static datasets. We extend it to the robotics domain through integration in a closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. This extension enhances reasoning in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) settings without relying solely on distillation of large models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We show that small-scale LLMs can achieve effective reasoning performance by learning through closed-loop interaction with their environment, which enables tasks that previously required significantly larger models. In an autonomous driving setting, a performance gain of 20.2%-points over the SFT-based baseline is observed with a Qwen2.5-1.5B model. Using the proposed training procedure, Qwen2.5-3B achieves a 63.3% control adaptability score, surpassing the 58.5% obtained by the much larger, cloud-bound GPT-4o. These results highlight that practical, on-board deployment of small LLMs is not only feasible but can outperform larger models if trained through environmental feedback, underscoring the importance of an interactive learning framework for robotic Embodied AI, one grounded in practical experience rather than static supervision.</p></details> |  |

This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |

Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> |

Closely packed objects cause inevitable occlusions, making safe action generation particularly difficult. Under such partial observability, effective policies must not only generalize across diverse objects and layouts but also reason about occlusion to avoid collisions. However, collecting large-scale real-world data for this task remains prohibitively expensive, leaving this problem largely unsolved. In this paper, we introduce FetchBot, a sim-to-real framework for this challenge. We first curate a large-scale synthetic dataset featuring 1M diverse scenes and 500k representative demonstrations. Based on this dataset, FetchBot employs a depth-conditioned method for action generation, which leverages structural cues to enable robust obstacle-aware action planning. However, depth is perfect in simulation but noisy in real-world environments. To address this sim-to-real gap, FetchBot predicts depth from RGB inputs using a foundation model and integrates local occupancy prediction as a pre-training task, providing a generalizable latent representation for sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the strong zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, effective clutter handling, and adaptability to novel scenarios. In cluttered environments, it achieves an average real-world success rate of 89.95%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, FetchBot demonstrates excellent robustness in challenging cases, such as fetching transparent, reflective, and irregular objects, highlighting its practical value.</p></details> | <details><summary>9th A...</summary><p>9th Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025, Oral)</p></details> |

In this work, we address the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture. Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval; (ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of 3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass; (iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach.

However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution, and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands. This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500 complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot. We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.</p></details> |  |

Vision-Language-Action models, inspired by advancements in large foundation models, serve as universal robotic control frameworks that substantially improve agent-environment interaction capabilities in embodied intelligence systems. This expansion has broadened application scenarios for embodied AI robots. This survey comprehensively reviews VLA models for embodied manipulation. Firstly, it chronicles the developmental trajectory of VLA architectures. Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of current research across 5 critical dimensions: VLA model structures, training datasets, pre-training methods, post-training methods, and model evaluation. Finally, we synthesize key challenges in VLA development and real-world deployment, while outlining promising future research directions.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

To formalize this setting, we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by both LLM-based and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + 2 pages references + 7 pages appendix</p></details> |

However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Embod...</summary><p>Embodied-R1 technical report</p></details> |

In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |

However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We present Switch4EAI(Switch-for-Embodied-AI), a low-cost and easily deployable pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games to evaluate whole-body robot control policies. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future work to for benchmarking embodied AI.</p></details> | Workshop Submission |
| **[Virtuous Machines: Towards Artificial General Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13421v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness, executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments, accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored. It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and the attribution of scientific credit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied Image Quality Assessment for Robotic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18774v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of User-Generated Content (UGC) is a critical technique for human Quality of Experience (QoE). However, does the the image quality of Robot-Generated Content (RGC) demonstrate traits consistent with the Moravec paradox, potentially conflicting with human perceptual norms? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the perception mechanism of embodied robots for image quality. We propose the first Embodied Preference Database (EPD), which contains 12,500 distorted image annotations. We establish assessment metrics based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, there is a gap between UGC and RGC. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-scale Attention Embodied Image Quality Assessment called MA-EIQA. For the proposed EPD dataset, this is the first no-reference IQA model designed for embodied robot. Finally, the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.</p></details> |  |

FormCoach transforms a simple camera into an always-on, interactive AI training partner, capable of spotting subtle form errors and delivering tailored corrections in real time, leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Affordance-Aware Robotic Dexterous Grasping with Human-like Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08896v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage, a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects, unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open dynamic environments. Recent breakthroughs in large models have revolutionized embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms, detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution, and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved, challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey, potentially as the further research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoSE: Skill-by-Skill Mixture-of-Experts Learning for Embodied Autonomous Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07818v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet the growing demand for smarter, faster, and more efficient embodied AI solutions, we introduce a novel Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) method that significantly boosts reasoning and learning efficiency for embodied autonomous systems. General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization, which limits their applicability in embodied AI such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose a skill-oriented MoE called MoSE, which mimics the human learning and reasoning process skill-by-skill, step-by-step. We introduce a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. To better align with multi-step planning in human reasoning and in end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike other multi-round dialogues, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g. perception-prediction-planning for AD, and high-level and low-level planning for robots) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model effectively grows more diverse expertise and outperforms models on both AD corner-case reasoning tasks and robot reasoning tasks with less than 40% of the parameters.</p></details> |  |

We also provide a rich variety of playable entities, including humans, animals, robots, and vehicles for embodied AI research. We extend UnrealCV with optimized APIs and tools for data collection, environment augmentation, distributed training, and benchmarking. These improvements achieve significant improvements in the efficiency of rendering and communication, enabling advanced applications such as multi-agent interactions. Our experimental evaluation across visual navigation and tracking tasks reveals two key insights: 1) environmental diversity provides substantial benefits for developing generalizable reinforcement learning (RL) agents, and 2) current embodied agents face persistent challenges in open-world scenarios, including navigation in unstructured terrain, adaptation to unseen morphologies, and managing latency in the close-loop control systems for interacting in highly dynamic objects. UnrealZoo thus serves as both a comprehensive testing ground and a pathway toward developing more capable embodied AI systems for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight), Project page: http://unrealzoo.site/</p></details> |

Generating synthetic images that closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins, facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using images generated by DiffPhysCam.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 17 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

This task requires the model to identify newly described objects that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that 3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language expressions in a spatially aware paradigm.

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

As robotics and automated systems scale, efficient data-sharing frameworks and robust algorithms become critical. We explore the pivotal role of data handling in next-gen networks, focusing on dynamics between application and network providers (AP/NP) in DT ecosystems. We introduce PANAMA, a novel algorithm with Priority Asymmetry for Network Aware Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based multi-agent path finding (MAPF). By adopting a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework and asynchronous actor-learner architectures, PANAMA accelerates training while enabling autonomous task execution by embodied AI. Our approach demonstrates superior pathfinding performance in accuracy, speed, and scalability compared to existing benchmarks. Through simulations, we highlight optimized data-sharing strategies for scalable, automated systems, ensuring resilience in complex, real-world environments. PANAMA bridges the gap between network-aware decision-making and robust multi-agent coordination, advancing the synergy between DTs, wireless networks, and AI-driven automation.</p></details> |  |

Embodied navigation requires an agent to perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety and increasing industrial efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We present OmniEAR, a comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to 56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically (0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/OmniEmbodied Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/OmniEmbodied</p></details> |

In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentSense: Virtual Sensor Data Generation Using LLM Agents in Simulated Home Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11773v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence.

| **[Exploring 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Activity Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D task planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advances in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the RoboTron-Craft, a stage-divided and cost-effective pipeline for realistic manipulation generation. Base on this, the RoboTron-Platter method is introduced, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.

| **[Object Affordance Recognition and Grounding via Multi-scale Cross-modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01184v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification). Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance grounding and classification.</p></details> |  |

| **[OpenFly: A Comprehensive Platform for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v6)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents by leveraging language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Exploring the Link Between Bayesian Inference and Embodied Intelligence: Toward Open Physical-World Embodied AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21589v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open physical-world embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Multifunctional physical reservoir computing in soft tensegrity robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21496v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be utilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical reservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully addressed to date.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 figures.

| **[MazeEval: A Benchmark for Testing Sequential Decision-Making in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20395v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.</p></details> |  |

While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive, expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types, combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation) generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive humanoid motion generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://rosielab.github.io/compas3d</p></details> |

As a burgeoning research frontier, 4D generation enables richer interactive and immersive experiences, with applications ranging from digital humans to autonomous driving. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks a unified understanding of 4D representations, generative frameworks, basic paradigms, and the core technical challenges it faces. This survey provides a systematic and in-depth review of the 4D generation landscape. To comprehensively characterize 4D generation, we first categorize fundamental 4D representations and outline associated techniques for 4D generation. We then present an in-depth analysis of representative generative pipelines based on conditions and representation methods. Subsequently, we discuss how motion and geometry priors are integrated into 4D outputs to ensure spatio-temporal consistency under various control schemes. From an application perspective, this paper summarizes 4D generation tasks in areas such as dynamic object/scene generation, digital human synthesis, editable 4D content, and embodied AI. Furthermore, we summarize and multi-dimensionally compare four basic paradigms for 4D generation: End-to-End, Generated-Data-Based, Implicit-Distillation-Based, and Explicit-Supervision-Based. Concluding our analysis, we highlight five key challenges-consistency, controllability, diversity, efficiency, and fidelity-and contextualize these with current approaches.By distilling recent advances and outlining open problems, this work offers a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective to guide future research in 4D generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards provable probabilistic safety for scalable embodied AI systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05171v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. Instead, empirical safety evaluation is employed as an alternative, but the absence of provable guarantees imposes significant limitations. To address these issues, we argue for a paradigm shift to provable probabilistic safety that integrates provable guarantees with progressive achievement toward a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance. The new paradigm better leverages statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability, and a well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for provable probabilistic safety, along with corresponding challenges and potential solutions. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, this Perspective offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  |

As they serve as the primary visual input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning. EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering (PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover, we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for on-device egomotion video reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \textbf{PhysX-3D}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research in generative physical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://physx-3d.github.io/</p></details> |

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

As a result, we are seeing similar advancements in embodied AI and robotics for control policy generation. Our review paper examines the integration of generative AI models with RL to advance robotics. Our primary focus is on the duality between generative AI and RL for robotics downstream tasks. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The role of prominent generative AI tools as modular priors for multi-modal input fusion in RL tasks. (2) How RL can train, fine-tune and distill generative models for policy generation, such as VLA models, similarly to RL applications in large language models. We then propose a new taxonomy based on a considerable amount of selected papers. Lastly, we identify open challenges accounting for model scalability, adaptation and grounding, giving recommendations and insights on future research directions. We reflect on which generative AI models best fit the RL tasks and why. On the other side, we reflect on important issues inherent to RL-enhanced generative policies, such as safety concerns and failure modes, and what are the limitations of current methods.

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks.

However, most navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training method.</p></details> | Under review |

However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Reasoning for Embodied Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22050v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Long-term Point Tracking in the Foundation Model Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09217v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However, real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets, offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines. However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time. Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks, demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.18487</p></details> |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models.

| **[SURPRISE3D: A Dataset for Spatial Understanding and Reasoning in Complex 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07781v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world. Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research. Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite. S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic planning.

| **[MapNav: A Novel Memory Representation via Annotated Semantic Maps for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13451v4)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a key task in Embodied AI, requiring agents to navigate diverse and unseen environments while following natural language instructions. Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoramic images, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 48 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing SOTA TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |
| **[A Neural Representation Framework with LLM-Driven Spatial Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06719v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical feature field. This field represents language and instance features using distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations, outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their spatial reasoning capability.</p></details> |  |

| **[Residual Off-Policy RL for Finetuning Behavior Cloning Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19301v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in behavior cloning (BC) have enabled impressive visuomotor control policies. However, these approaches are limited by the quality of human demonstrations, the manual effort required for data collection, and the diminishing returns from increasing offline data. In comparison, reinforcement learning (RL) trains an agent through autonomous interaction with the environment and has shown remarkable success in various domains. Still, training RL policies directly on real-world robots remains challenging due to sample inefficiency, safety concerns, and the difficulty of learning from sparse rewards for long-horizon tasks, especially for high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems. We present a recipe that combines the benefits of BC and RL through a residual learning framework. Our approach leverages BC policies as black-box bases and learns lightweight per-step residual corrections via sample-efficient off-policy RL. We demonstrate that our method requires only sparse binary reward signals and can effectively improve manipulation policies on high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in both simulation and the real world. In particular, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful real-world RL training on a humanoid robot with dexterous hands. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in various vision-based tasks, pointing towards a practical pathway for deploying RL in the real world.

Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes. In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of incorporating privileged information in Safe RL. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the Privileged Information Guided Dreamer (PIGDreamer), a model-based RL approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that PIGDreamer significantly outperforms existing Safe RL methods. Furthermore, compared to alternative privileged RL methods, our approach exhibits enhanced performance, robustness, and efficiency. Codes are available at: https://github.com/hggforget/PIGDreamer.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19249v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$, $6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Online Process Reward Leanring for Agentic Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19199v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) as autonomous agents that reason and act over long horizons in interactive environments. However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards make temporal credit assignment extremely challenging. Recent work attempts to integrate process supervision into agent learning but suffers from biased annotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly fine-grained signals or failtures when state overlap is rare. We therefore introduce Online Process Reward Learning (OPRL), a general credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL that integrates seamlessly with standard on-policy algorithms without relying on additional rollouts or explicit step labels. In OPRL, we optimize an implicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with the agent's policy to transform trajectory preferences into implicit step rewards through a trajectory-based DPO objective. These step rewards are then used to compute step-level advantages, which are combined with episode-level advantages from outcome rewards for policy update, creating a self-reinforcing loop. Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent with trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards, providing bounded gradients to stabilize training. Empirically, we evaluate OPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as open-ended social interactions with unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA. Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher sample-efficiency and lower variance during training. Further analysis also demonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using fewer actions, underscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Soft Tokens, Hard Truths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19170v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens. This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.</p></details> |  |

We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs.\ long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets on Qwen3-8B-Base model.</p></details> |  |

Linear temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements, yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Reinforcement Learning by Reducing Forgetting with Elephant Activation Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19159v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Catastrophic forgetting has remained a significant challenge for efficient reinforcement learning for decades (Ring 1994, Rivest and Precup 2003). While recent works have proposed effective methods to mitigate this issue, they mainly focus on the algorithmic side. Meanwhile, we do not fully understand what architectural properties of neural networks lead to catastrophic forgetting. This study aims to fill this gap by studying the role of activation functions in the training dynamics of neural networks and their impact on catastrophic forgetting in reinforcement learning setup. Our study reveals that, besides sparse representations, the gradient sparsity of activation functions also plays an important role in reducing forgetting. Based on this insight, we propose a new class of activation functions, elephant activation functions, that can generate both sparse outputs and sparse gradients. We show that by simply replacing classical activation functions with elephant activation functions in the neural networks of value-based algorithms, we can significantly improve the resilience of neural networks to catastrophic forgetting, thus making reinforcement learning more sample-efficient and memory-efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code release: https://github.com/qlan3/ENN</p></details> |

However, effectively scaling these RL methods presents significant challenges, primarily due to the difficulty in maintaining high AI accelerator utilization without generating stale, off-policy data that harms common RL algorithms. This paper introduces PipelineRL, an approach designed to achieve a superior trade-off between hardware efficiency and data on-policyness for LLM training. PipelineRL employs concurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by the novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation engine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the generation of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator utilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on long-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL achieves approximately $\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL baselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and modular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key contribution.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the training process tends to exhibit strong randomness and slow convergence. It often requires considerable time or high computational resources. Another class of learning-based method incorporates Lyapunov stability theory to obtain a control policy with stability guarantees. However, these methods generally require an initially stable neural network control policy at the beginning of training. Evidently, a stable neural network controller can not only serve as an initial policy for reinforcement learning, allowing the training to focus on improving controller performance, but also act as an initial state for learning-based Lyapunov control methods. Although stable controllers can be designed using traditional control theory, designers still need to have a great deal of control design knowledge to address increasingly complicated control problems. The proposed neural network rapid initialization method in this paper achieves the initial training of the neural network control policy by constructing datasets that conform to the stability conditions based on the system model. Furthermore, using the image-based visual servoing control for multicopter interception as a case study, simulations and experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness and practical performance of the proposed method. In the experiment, the trained control policy attains a final interception velocity of 15 m/s.</p></details> |  |

However, existing offline RLHF approaches suffer from overoptimization, where models overfit to reward misspecification and drift from preferred behaviors observed during training. We introduce DRO-REBEL, a unified family of robust REBEL updates with type-$p$ Wasserstein, KL, and $\chi^2$ ambiguity sets. Using Fenchel duality, each update reduces to a simple relative-reward regression, preserving scalability and avoiding PPO-style clipping or auxiliary value networks. Under standard linear-reward and log-linear policy classes with a data-coverage condition, we establish $O(n^{-1/4})$ estimation bounds with tighter constants than prior DRO-DPO approaches, and recover the minimax-optimal $O(n^{-1/2})$ rate via a localized Rademacher complexity analysis. The same analysis closes the gap for Wasserstein-DPO and KL-DPO, showing both also attain optimal parametric rates. We derive practical SGD algorithms for all three divergences: gradient regularization (Wasserstein), importance weighting (KL), and a fast 1-D dual solve ($\chi^2$). Experiments on Emotion Alignment, the large-scale ArmoRM multi-objective benchmark, and HH-Alignment demonstrate strong worst-case robustness across unseen preference mixtures, model sizes, and data scales, with $\chi^2$-REBEL showing consistently strong empirical performance. A controlled radius--coverage study validates a no-free-lunch trade-off: radii shrinking faster than empirical divergence concentration rates achieve minimax-optimal parametric rates but forfeit coverage, while coverage-guaranteeing radii incur $O(n^{-1/4})$ rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>70 pa...</summary><p>70 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Reinforcement learning can refine polices to alleviate this limitation, yet real-robot training is costly and unsafe, while training in simulators suffers from the sim-to-real gap. Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in real-world simulation, with diffusion models in particular excelling at generation. This raises the question of how diffusion model-based world models can be combined to enhance pre-trained policies in robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose World4RL, a framework that employs diffusion-based world models as high-fidelity simulators to refine pre-trained policies entirely in imagined environments for robotic manipulation. Unlike prior works that primarily employ world models for planning, our framework enables direct end-to-end policy optimization. World4RL is designed around two principles: pre-training a diffusion world model that captures diverse dynamics on multi-task datasets and refining policies entirely within a frozen world model to avoid online real-world interactions. We further design a two-hot action encoding scheme tailored for robotic manipulation and adopt diffusion backbones to improve modeling fidelity. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that World4RL provides high-fidelity environment modeling and enables consistent policy refinement, yielding significantly higher success rates compared to imitation learning and other baselines.

Unlike DeepFake techniques that focus on localized facial manipulation, human-centric video generation methods can synthesize entire human bodies with controllable movements, enabling complex interactions with environments, objects, and even other people. However, existing detection methods largely overlook the growing risks posed by such full-body synthetic content. Meanwhile, a growing body of research has explored leveraging LLMs for interpretable fake detection, aiming to explain decisions in natural language. Yet these approaches heavily depend on supervised fine-tuning, which introduces limitations such as annotation bias, hallucinated supervision, and weakened generalization. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, a novel multimodal human-centric synthetic video detection framework that eliminates the need for dense textual supervision by adopting Group Relative Policy Optimization, enabling LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities from simple binary labels. Our architecture combines a discrete vision tower for high-level semantic inconsistencies and a residual extractor for fine-grained artifact analysis. We further introduce FakeHumanVid, a large-scale benchmark containing 15K real and synthetic videos across nine state-of-the-art human generation methods driven by text, pose, or audio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AvatarShield outperforms existing methods in both in-domain and cross-domain settings.</p></details> |  |

Offline Imitation learning (IL) avoids these risks by collecting expert demonstrations safely, training entirely offline, and deploying policies zero-shot. However, we find that naively applying Behaviour Cloning (BC) to social navigation is insufficient; achieving strong performance requires careful architectural and training choices. We present Ratatouille, a pipeline and model architecture that, without changing the data, reduces collisions per meter by 6 times and improves success rate by 3 times compared to naive BC. We validate our approach in both simulation and the real world, where we collected over 11 hours of data on a dense university campus. We further demonstrate qualitative results in a public food court. Our findings highlight that thoughtful IL design, rather than additional data, can substantially improve safety and reliability in real-world social navigation. Video: https://youtu.be/tOdLTXsaYLQ.

In the first stage, a compact 4-DOF (four-degree-of-freedom) reduced-order model (ROM) is trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. This generates energy-efficient gait templates. In the second stage, those dynamically consistent trajectories guide a full-body policy trained with Soft Actor--Critic augmented by an adversarial discriminator, ensuring the student's five-dimensional gait feature distribution matches the ROM's demonstrations. Experiments at 1 meter-per-second and 4 meter-per-second show that ROM-GRL produces stable, symmetric gaits with substantially lower tracking error than a pure-reward baseline. By distilling lightweight ROM guidance into high-dimensional policies, ROM-GRL bridges the gap between reward-only and imitation-based locomotion methods, enabling versatile, naturalistic humanoid behaviors without any human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, Computational Science Graduate Project</p></details> |
| **[Fully Learnable Neural Reward Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19017v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks present significant challenges, as agents must reason over entire trajectories of state-action pairs to make optimal decisions. A common strategy to address this is through symbolic formalisms, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) or automata, which provide a structured way to express temporally extended objectives. However, these approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as the availability of a predefined Symbol Grounding (SG) function mapping raw observations to high-level symbolic representations, or prior knowledge of the temporal task. In this work, we propose a fully learnable version of Neural Reward Machines (NRM), which can learn both the SG function and the automaton end-to-end, removing any reliance on prior knowledge. Our approach is therefore as easily applicable as classic deep RL (DRL) approaches, while being far more explainable, because of the finite and compact nature of automata. Furthermore, we show that by integrating Fully Learnable Reward Machines (FLNRM) with DRL, our method outperforms previous approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).</p></details> |  |

Existing attempts typically employ reasoning chains at a coarse-grained level, which struggles to perform fine-grained structured reasoning and, more importantly, are difficult to evaluate the reward and quality of intermediate reasoning. In this work, we delve into chain of step reasoning for vision-language models, enabling assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. We present a simple, effective, and fully transparent framework, including the step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement learning training. With the proposed approaches, our models set strong baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language benchmarks. More importantly, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis and ablation study, unveiling the impact of each component and several intriguing properties of inference-time scaling. We believe this paper serves as a baseline for vision-language models and offers insights into more complex multimodal reasoning.

To address the issues of distributed decisions in cloud-edge environments, we present TD3-Sched, a distributed reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduler based on Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) for continuous control of CPU and memory allocation, which can achieve optimized decisions for resource provisioning under dynamic workloads. On a realistic cloud-edge testbed with SockShop application and Alibaba traces, TD3-Sched achieves reductions of 17.9% to 38.6% in latency under same loads compared with other reinforcement-learning and rule-based baselines, and 16% to 31.6% under high loads. TD3-Sched also shows superior Service Level Objective (SLO) compliance with only 0.47% violations. These results indicate faster convergence, lower latency, and more stable performance while preserving service quality in container-based cloud-edge environment compared with the baselines.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Despite its successes, important limitations remain: inability to construct valid solutions without post-processing and to reason about multiple correct ones, poor performance on combinatorial NP-hard problems, and inapplicability to problems for which strong algorithms are not yet known. To address these limitations, we reframe the problem of learning algorithm trajectories as a Markov Decision Process, which imposes structure on the solution construction procedure and unlocks the powerful tools of imitation and reinforcement learning (RL). We propose the GNARL framework, encompassing the methodology to translate problem formulations from NAR to RL and a learning architecture suitable for a wide range of graph-based problems. We achieve very high graph accuracy results on several CLRS-30 problems, performance matching or exceeding much narrower NAR approaches for NP-hard problems and, remarkably, applicability even when lacking an expert algorithm.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged mobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise coordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified reinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills involving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and striking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that utilizes real-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between simulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors. Our method includes a shuttlecock prediction model, constrained reinforcement learning for robust motion control, and integrated system identification techniques to enhance deployment readiness. Extensive experimental results in a variety of environments validate the robot's capability to predict shuttlecock trajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise strikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged mobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Scien...</summary><p>Science Robotics DOI: 10.1126/scirobotics.adu3922</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Point Prompt Defender, an adversarial reinforcement learning framework that adopts an attack-for-defense paradigm to automatically optimize point prompts. We construct a task-agnostic point prompt environment by representing image patches as nodes in a dual-space graph, where edges encode both physical and semantic distances. Within this environment, an attacker agent learns to activate a subset of prompts that maximally degrade SAM's segmentation performance, while a defender agent learns to suppress these disruptive prompts and restore accuracy. Both agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks with a reward signal based on segmentation quality variation. During inference, only the defender is deployed to refine arbitrary coarse prompt sets, enabling enhanced SAM segmentation performance across diverse tasks without retraining. Extensive experiments show that Point Prompt Defender effectively improves SAM's robustness and generalization, establishing a flexible, interpretable, and plug-and-play framework for prompt-based segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Its advanced capabilities are cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start training strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and equips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning. Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result, LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5% (from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems and agentic AI research.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for user profiling, yet the progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose ProfileBench, an industrial benchmark derived from a real-world video platform, encompassing heterogeneous user data and a well-structured profiling taxonomy. However, the profiling task remains challenging due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale ground-truth labels, and the heterogeneous and noisy user information can compromise the reliability of LLMs. To approach label-free and reliable user profiling, we propose a Confidence-driven Profile reasoning framework Conf-Profile, featuring a two-stage paradigm. We first synthesize high-quality labels by leveraging advanced LLMs with confidence hints, followed by confidence-weighted voting for accuracy improvement and confidence calibration for a balanced distribution. The multiple profile results, rationales, and confidence scores are aggregated and distilled into a lightweight LLM. We further enhance the reasoning ability via confidence-guided unsupervised reinforcement learning, which exploits confidence for difficulty filtering, quasi-ground truth voting, and reward weighting. Experimental results demonstrate that Conf-Profile delivers substantial performance through the two-stage training, improving F1 by 13.97 on Qwen3-8B.</p></details> |  |
| **[WavReward: Spoken Dialogue Models With Generalist Reward Evaluators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09558v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end spoken dialogue models such as GPT-4o-audio have recently garnered significant attention in the speech domain. However, the evaluation of spoken dialogue models' conversational performance has largely been overlooked. This is primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual information which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models like ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback model based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of spoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio language models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the nonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample feedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized evaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a preference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both comprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios span various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of instruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous state-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios, achieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy from 53.4$\%$ to 91.5$\%$. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a margin of 83$\%$. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each component of WavReward. All data and code will be publicly at https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavReward after the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAPO: Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18849v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning for foundation models, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have significantly improved the performance of foundation models on reasoning tasks. Notably, the advantage function serves as a central mechanism in GRPO for ranking the trajectory importance. However, existing explorations encounter both advantage reversion and advantage mirror problems, which hinder the reasonable advantage allocation across different query samples. In this work, we propose an easy but effective GRPO strategy, Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization (MAPO). We reveal that the trajectory appears with different certainty and propose the advantage percent deviation for samples with high-certainty trajectories. Furthermore, we dynamically reweight the advantage function for samples with varying trajectory certainty, thereby adaptively configuring the advantage function to account for sample-specific characteristics. Comparison with related state-of-the-art methods, along with ablation studies on different advantage variants, validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Failure Makes the Agent Stronger: Enhancing Accuracy through Structured Reflection for Reliable Tool Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18847v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit, controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call, reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits. Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for agents to learn from failure.</p></details> | 9pages |

Replicating these tactile sensing capabilities for dexterous robotic manipulation systems remains a longstanding challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by introducing DexSkin. DexSkin is a soft, conformable capacitive electronic skin that enables sensitive, localized, and calibratable tactile sensing, and can be tailored to varying geometries. We demonstrate its efficacy for learning downstream robotic manipulation by sensorizing a pair of parallel jaw gripper fingers, providing tactile coverage across almost the entire finger surfaces. We empirically evaluate DexSkin's capabilities in learning challenging manipulation tasks that require sensing coverage across the entire surface of the fingers, such as reorienting objects in hand and wrapping elastic bands around boxes, in a learning-from-demonstration framework. We then show that, critically for data-driven approaches, DexSkin can be calibrated to enable model transfer across sensor instances, and demonstrate its applicability to online reinforcement learning on real robots. Our results highlight DexSkin's suitability and practicality for learning real-world, contact-rich manipulation.

Existing analysis of PMD requires exact or approximate evaluation (for example unbiased estimation via Monte Carlo simulation) of action values solely based on policy. In this paper, we consider policy mirror descent with temporal difference evaluation (TD-PMD). It is shown that, given the access to exact policy evaluations, the dimension-free $O(1/T)$ sublinear convergence still holds for TD-PMD with any constant step size and any initialization. In order to achieve this result, new monotonicity and shift invariance arguments have been developed. The dimension free $\gamma$-rate linear convergence of TD-PMD is also established provided the step size is selected adaptively. For the two common instances of TD-PMD (i.e., TD-PQA and TD-NPG), it is further shown that they enjoy the convergence in the policy domain. Additionally, we investigate TD-PMD in the inexact setting and give the sample complexity for it to achieve the last iterate $\varepsilon$-optimality under a generative model, which improves the last iterate sample complexity for PMD over the dependence on $1/(1-\gamma)$.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships. This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models. Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new, high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

The inherent complexity of emotional content in human speech makes it challenging for traditional discrete classification methods to provide an adequate representation. Consequently, utilizing natural language to describe speech emotions presents a novel avenue for more effectively capturing and expressing affect. In this paper, we propose MECap-R1, a pioneering emotion-aware policy with reinforcement learning for multimodal emotion captioning. By employing Group Relative Policy Optimization with emotion-aware reward (Emo-GRPO), the framework precisely captures the emotion and semantic features, thereby addressing the shortcomings of rigid rules in handling the dynamic and flexible nature of captions.

A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the EH efficiency of the UAV-mounted RIS by controlling the user powers, RIS phase shifts, and time-switching factor, subject to quality of service and practical EH constraints. The problem is nonconvex and time-coupled due to UAV angular jitter and nonlinear EH dynamics, making it intractable for conventional optimization methods. To address this, we reformulate the problem as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) environment and develop a smoothed softmax dual deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. The proposed method incorporates action clipping, entropy regularization, and softmax-weighted Q-value estimation to improve learning stability and exploration. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges reliably under various UAV jitter levels and achieves an average EH efficiency of 45.07\%, approaching the 53.09\% upper bound of exhaustive search, and outperforming other DRL baselines.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages LLMs to iteratively enhance reward functions, achieving better fraud detection accuracy and demonstrating zero-shot capability.

While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard problems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing exploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on teacher models for distillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or restricts reasoning improvement through exploration. We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on two-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the exploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then gradually shortens CoT steps to expand the space in a controlled way. The framework enables LLMs to stably learn from initially unsolved hard problems under sparse rewards. We apply EvoCoT to multiple LLM families, including Qwen, DeepSeek, and Llama. Experiments show that EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously unsolved problems, improves reasoning capability without external CoT supervision, and is compatible with various RL fine-tuning methods. We release the source code to support future research.</p></details> |  |

We present HDMI (HumanoiD iMitation for Interaction), a simple and general framework that learns whole-body humanoid-object interaction skills directly from monocular RGB videos. Our pipeline (i) extracts and retargets human and object trajectories from unconstrained videos to build structured motion datasets, (ii) trains a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to co-track robot and object states with three key designs: a unified object representation, a residual action space, and a general interaction reward, and (iii) zero-shot deploys the RL policies on real humanoid robots. Extensive sim-to-real experiments on a Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate the robustness and generality of our approach: HDMI achieves 67 consecutive door traversals and successfully performs 6 distinct loco-manipulation tasks in the real world and 14 tasks in simulation. Our results establish HDMI as a simple and general framework for acquiring interactive humanoid skills from human videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website: hdmi-humanoid.github.io</p></details> |

Simulators provide safe, scalable training environments, but the inevitable sim-to-real gap introduces additional safety concerns, as policies must satisfy constraints in real-world conditions that differ from simulation. To address this challenge, robust safe RL techniques offer principled methods, but are often incompatible with standard scalable training pipelines. In contrast, domain randomization, a simple and popular sim-to-real technique, stands out as a promising alternative, although it often results in unsafe behaviors in practice. We present SPiDR, short for Sim-to-real via Pessimistic Domain Randomization -- a scalable algorithm with provable guarantees for safe sim-to-real transfer. SPiDR uses domain randomization to incorporate the uncertainty about the sim-to-real gap into the safety constraints, making it versatile and highly compatible with existing training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on sim-to-sim benchmarks and two distinct real-world robotic platforms, we demonstrate that SPiDR effectively ensures safety despite the sim-to-real gap while maintaining strong performance.</p></details> |  |

However, integrating reasoning with external search processes remains challenging, especially for complex multi-hop questions requiring multiple retrieval steps. We propose ReSearch, a novel framework that trains LLMs to Reason with Search via reinforcement learning without using any supervised data on reasoning steps. Our approach treats search operations as integral components of the reasoning chain, where when and how to perform searches is guided by text-based thinking, and search results subsequently influence further reasoning. We train ReSearch on Qwen2.5-7B(-Instruct) and Qwen2.5-32B(-Instruct) models and conduct extensive experiments. Despite being trained on only one dataset, our models demonstrate strong generalizability across various benchmarks. Analysis reveals that ReSearch naturally elicits advanced reasoning capabilities such as reflection and self-correction during the reinforcement learning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Prevailing work typically follows a scale-driven paradigm, by multi-stage training over large paired corpora and oversized backbones, making pipelines highly data- and compute-intensive. In this paper, we propose Oracle-educated GRPO {OraPO) with a FactScore-based reward (FactS) to tackle the RRG task under constrained budgets. OraPO enables single-stage, RL-only training by converting failed GRPO explorations on rare or difficult studies into direct preference supervision via a lightweight oracle step. FactS grounds learning in diagnostic evidence by extracting atomic clinical facts and checking entailment against ground-truth labels, yielding dense, interpretable sentence-level rewards. Together, OraPO and FactS create a compact and powerful framework that significantly improves learning efficiency on clinically challenging cases, setting the new SOTA performance on the CheXpert Plus dataset (0.341 in F1) with 2--3 orders of magnitude less training data using a small base VLM on modest hardware.</p></details> |  |

While reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly enhanced LLM performance in text-based tasks, its application to ASR and TTS remains underexplored due to the complexity of training audio-based models. In this study, we propose a lightweight RL framework tailored for audio-based LLMs that can process audio inputs and generate audio outputs. Based on this framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning on both ASR and TTS tasks. For the ASR task, we experiment with different rule-based reward functions within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and investigate the impact of RL data construction. For the TTS task, we compare GRPO with Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO) and further combine the two approaches to achieve improved performance. Our experiments demonstrate that RL can significantly enhance the performance of both ASR and TTS systems, even with limited training data and a small number of optimization steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can GRPO Boost Complex Multimodal Table Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16889v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing table understanding methods face challenges due to complex table structures and intricate logical reasoning. While supervised finetuning (SFT) dominates existing research, reinforcement learning (RL), such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown promise but struggled with low initial policy accuracy and coarse rewards in tabular contexts. In this paper, we introduce Table-R1, a three-stage RL framework that enhances multimodal table understanding through: (1) Warm-up that prompts initial perception and reasoning capabilities, (2) Perception Alignment GRPO (PA-GRPO), which employs continuous Tree-Edit-Distance Similarity (TEDS) rewards for recognizing table structures and contents, and (3) Hint-Completion GRPO (HC-GRPO), which utilizes fine-grained rewards of residual steps based on the hint-guided question. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Table-R1 can boost the model's table reasoning performance obviously on both held-in and held-out datasets, outperforming SFT and GRPO largely. Notably, Qwen2-VL-7B with Table-R1 surpasses larger specific table understanding models (e.g., Table-LLaVA 13B), even achieving comparable performance to the closed-source model GPT-4o on held-in datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of each stage of Table-R1 in overcoming initialization bottlenecks and reward sparsity, thereby advancing robust multimodal table understanding.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[RoboSeek: You Need to Interact with Your Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17783v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing and refining action execution through exploration and interaction is a promising way for robotic manipulation. However, practical approaches to interaction-driven robotic learning are still underexplored, particularly for long-horizon tasks where sequential decision-making, physical constraints, and perceptual uncertainties pose significant challenges. Motivated by embodied cognition theory, we propose RoboSeek, a framework for embodied action execution that leverages interactive experience to accomplish manipulation tasks. RoboSeek optimizes prior knowledge from high-level perception models through closed-loop training in simulation and achieves robust real-world execution via a real2sim2real transfer pipeline. Specifically, we first replicate real-world environments in simulation using 3D reconstruction to provide visually and physically consistent environments, then we train policies in simulation using reinforcement learning and the cross-entropy method leveraging visual priors. The learned policies are subsequently deployed on real robotic platforms for execution. RoboSeek is hardware-agnostic and is evaluated on multiple robotic platforms across eight long-horizon manipulation tasks involving sequential interactions, tool use, and object handling. Our approach achieves an average success rate of 79%, significantly outperforming baselines whose success rates remain below 50%, highlighting its generalization and robustness across tasks and platforms. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our training framework in complex, dynamic real-world settings and demonstrate the stability of the proposed real2sim2real transfer mechanism, paving the way for more generalizable embodied robotic learning.

| **[Accelerating Network Slice Placement with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18545v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cellular networks are increasingly realized through software-based entities, with core functions deployed as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware. Network slicing has emerged as a key enabler of 5G by providing logically isolated Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for diverse applications. With the adoption of cloud-native infrastructures, the placement of network slices across heterogeneous multi-cloud environments poses new challenges due to variable resource capabilities and slice-specific requirements. This paper introduces a modular framework for autonomous and near-optimal VNF placement based on a disaggregated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach. The framework incorporates real traffic profiles to estimate slice resource demands and employs a MARL-based scheduler to minimize deployment cost while meeting QoS constraints. Experimental evaluation on a multi-cloud testbed shows a 19x speed-up compared to combinatorial optimization, with deployment costs within 7.8% of the optimal. While the method incurs up to 2.42x more QoS violations under high load, the trade-off provides significantly faster decision-making and reduced computational complexity. These results suggest that MARL-based approaches offer a scalable and cost-efficient solution for real-time network slice placement in heterogeneous infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

Yet most multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches focus on isolated stages - exploration, relay formation, or access - under static deployments and centralized control, limiting adaptability. We propose the AI Agent Access (A\^3) Network, a unified, embodied intelligence-driven framework that transforms multi-agent networking into a dynamic, decentralized, and end-to-end system. Unlike prior schemes, the A\^3 Network integrates exploration, target user access, and backhaul maintenance within a single learning process, while supporting on-demand agent addition during runtime. Its decentralized policies ensure that even a single agent can operate independently with limited observations, while coordinated agents achieve scalable, communication-optimized coverage. By embedding link-level communication metrics into actor-critic learning, the A\^3 Network couples topology formation with robust decision-making. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the A\^3 Network not only balances exploration and communication efficiency but also delivers system-level adaptability absent in existing MARL frameworks, offering a new paradigm for 6G multi-agent networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[APRIL: Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning to tame long-tail generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18521v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone in advancing large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs). Successive generations, including GPT-o series, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale RL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the community's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most of these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation and training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains computationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90% of total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the long-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy responses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model and rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits scalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the rollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the target number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for continuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are discarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that APRIL improves rollout throughput by at most 44% across commonly used RL algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves at most 8% higher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and hardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and deployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies system-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of advancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Envelope MPC: High Performance Driving without a Reference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18506v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel envelope based model predictive control (MPC) framework designed to enable autonomous vehicles to handle high performance driving across a wide range of scenarios without a predefined reference. In high performance autonomous driving, safe operation at the vehicle's dynamic limits requires a real time planning and control framework capable of accounting for key vehicle dynamics and environmental constraints when following a predefined reference trajectory is suboptimal or even infeasible. State of the art planning and control frameworks, however, are predominantly reference based, which limits their performance in such situations. To address this gap, this work first introduces a computationally efficient vehicle dynamics model tailored for optimization based control and a continuously differentiable mathematical formulation that accurately captures the entire drivable envelope. This novel model and formulation allow for the direct integration of dynamic feasibility and safety constraints into a unified planning and control framework, thereby removing the necessity for predefined references. The challenge of envelope planning, which refers to maximally approximating the safe drivable area, is tackled by combining reinforcement learning with optimization techniques. The framework is validated through both simulations and real world experiments, demonstrating its high performance across a variety of tasks, including racing, emergency collision avoidance and off road navigation. These results highlight the framework's scalability and broad applicability across a diverse set of scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved notable success in training robust locomotion policies over diverse terrain, yet it lacks guarantees of constraint satisfaction and often requires substantial reward shaping. Recent efforts in combining MPC and RL have shown promise of taking the best of both worlds, but they are primarily restricted to flat terrain or quadrupedal robots. In this work, we propose an RL-augmented MPC framework tailored for bipedal locomotion over rough and slippery terrain. Our method parametrizes three key components of single-rigid-body-dynamics-based MPC: system dynamics, swing leg controller, and gait frequency. We validate our approach through bipedal robot simulations in NVIDIA IsaacLab across various terrains, including stairs, stepping stones, and low-friction surfaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our RL-augmented MPC framework produces significantly more adaptive and robust behaviors compared to baseline MPC and RL.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we developed a new reward function mutation framework that is based on applying Gaussian noise to the weights of the different terms in the reward function. Inspired by the cost-benefit tradeoff model from human motor control, we designed the reward function with the following key terms: accuracy, time, and effort. The study was performed in a simulation environment created in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and the setup included Franka Emika Panda robotic arm holding a glass with a liquid that needed to be poured into a container. The reinforcement learning algorithm was based on Proximal Policy Optimization. We systematically explored how different configurations of mutated weights in the rewards function would affect the learned policy. The resulting policies exhibit a wide range of behaviours: from variations in execution of the originally intended pouring task to novel skills useful for unexpected tasks, such as container rim cleaning, liquid mixing, and watering. This approach offers promising directions for robotic systems to perform diversified learning of specific tasks, while also potentially deriving meaningful skills for future tasks.</p></details> |  |

Gaming and esports are key areas influenced by the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) solutions at scale. Tooling simplifies scientific workloads and is essential for developing the gaming and esports research area. In this work, we present ``SC2Tools'', a toolset containing multiple submodules responsible for working with, and producing larger datasets. We provide a modular structure of the implemented tooling, leaving room for future extensions where needed. Additionally, some of the tools are not StarCraft~2 exclusive and can be used with other types of data for dataset creation. The tools we present were leveraged in creating one of the largest StarCraft~2 tournament datasets to date with a separate PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning application programming interface (API) for easy access to the data. We conclude that alleviating the burden of data collection, preprocessing, and custom code development is essential for less technically proficient researchers to engage in the growing gaming and esports research area. Finally, our solution provides some foundational work toward normalizing experiment workflow in StarCraft~2</p></details> |  |

However, implementation poses significant challenges. Defining direct rewards is difficult, and inverse RL (IRL) struggles to infer accurate reward functions from expert behavior in complex environments. Offline RL also encounters challenges in aligning learned policies with observed human behavior in healthcare applications. To address challenges in applying offline RL to physical activity promotion for older adults at high risk of falls, based on wearable sensor activity monitoring, we introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Diffusion Policies for Offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning (KANDI). By leveraging the flexible function approximation in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, we estimate reward functions by learning free-living environment behavior from low-fall-risk older adults (experts), while diffusion-based policies within an Actor-Critic framework provide a generative approach for action refinement and efficiency in offline RL. We evaluate KANDI using wearable activity monitoring data in a two-arm clinical trial from our Physio-feedback Exercise Program (PEER) study, emphasizing its practical application in a fall-risk intervention program to promote physical activity among older adults. Additionally, KANDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the D4RL benchmark. These results underscore KANDI's potential to address key challenges in offline RL for healthcare applications, offering an effective solution for activity promotion intervention strategies in healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICMLA 2025. 8 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

We investigate how autoregressive LLMs perform multi-label classification, focusing on subjective tasks, by analyzing the output distributions of the models at each label generation step. We find that the initial probability distribution for the first label often does not reflect the eventual final output, even in terms of relative order and find LLMs tend to suppress all but one label at each generation step. We further observe that as model scale increases, their token distributions exhibit lower entropy and higher single-label confidence, but the internal relative ranking of the labels improves. Finetuning methods such as supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning amplify this phenomenon. We introduce the task of distribution alignment for multi-label settings: aligning LLM-derived label distributions with empirical distributions estimated from annotator responses in subjective tasks. We propose both zero-shot and supervised methods which improve both alignment and predictive performance over existing approaches. We find one method -- taking the max probability over all label generation distributions instead of just using the initial probability distribution -- improves both distribution alignment and overall F1 classification without adding any additional computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Main Conference Proceedings of EMNLP 2025, 24 pages, 16 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Provable Emergence of In-Context Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18389v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typically, a modern reinforcement learning (RL) agent solves a task by updating its neural network parameters to adapt its policy to the task. Recently, it has been observed that some RL agents can solve a wide range of new out-of-distribution tasks without parameter updates after pretraining on some task distribution. When evaluated in a new task, instead of making parameter updates, the pretrained agent conditions its policy on additional input called the context, e.g., the agent's interaction history in the new task. The agent's performance increases as the information in the context increases, with the agent's parameters fixed. This phenomenon is typically called in-context RL (ICRL). The pretrained parameters of the agent network enable the remarkable ICRL phenomenon. However, many ICRL works perform the pretraining with standard RL algorithms. This raises the central question this paper aims to address: Why can the RL pretraining algorithm generate network parameters that enable ICRL? We hypothesize that the parameters capable of ICRL are minimizers of the pretraining loss. This work provides initial support for this hypothesis through a case study. In particular, we prove that when a Transformer is pretrained for policy evaluation, one of the global minimizers of the pretraining loss can enable in-context temporal difference learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, 28 pages</p></details> |

However, this increase in performance comes with a significant increase in computational cost. In this work, we investigate two compute constraint strategies: (1) reasoning length constraint and (2) model quantization, as methods to reduce the compute demand of reasoning models and study their impact on their safety performance. Specifically, we explore two approaches to apply compute constraints to reasoning models: (1) fine-tuning reasoning models using a length controlled policy optimization (LCPO) based reinforcement learning method to satisfy a user-defined CoT reasoning length, and (2) applying quantization to maximize the generation of CoT sequences within a user-defined compute constraint. Furthermore, we study the trade-off between the computational efficiency and the safety of the model.</p></details> |  |

Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL networks. The proposed scheduler is an embodied agent (E-agent) tailored for task-specific, resource-efficient operation at the network edge.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted by 2025 IEEE Globecom Workshops</p></details> |

However, reward modeling based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumes a global reward function, failing to capture the inherently diverse and heterogeneous human preferences. Hence, such oversimplification limits LLMs from supporting personalization and pluralistic alignment. Theoretically, we show that when human preferences follow a mixture distribution of diverse subgroups, a single BT model has an irreducible error. While existing solutions, such as multi-objective learning with fine-grained annotations, help address this issue, they are costly and constrained by predefined attributes, failing to fully capture the richness of human values. In this work, we introduce MiCRo, a two-stage framework that enhances personalized preference learning by leveraging large-scale binary preference datasets without requiring explicit fine-grained annotations. In the first stage, MiCRo introduces context-aware mixture modeling approach to capture diverse human preferences. In the second stage, MiCRo integrates an online routing strategy that dynamically adapts mixture weights based on specific context to resolve ambiguity, allowing for efficient and scalable preference adaptation with minimal additional supervision. Experiments on multiple preference datasets demonstrate that MiCRo effectively captures diverse human preferences and significantly improves downstream personalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Tree Structure for Credit Assignment in RL Training of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18314v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning improves LLM reasoning, yet sparse delayed reward over long sequences makes token-level credit assignment the key bottleneck. We study the verifiable-reward setting, where the final answer is checkable and multiple responses can be drawn per prompt. Reasoning tasks in math and medical QA align with this setup, where only a few decision tokens significantly impact the outcome. PPO offers token-level advantages with a learned value model, but it is complex to train both the actor and critic models simultaneously, and it is not easily generalizable, as the token-level values from the critic model can make training prone to overfitting. GRPO is critic-free and supports verifiable rewards, but spreads a single sequence-level return across tokens and ignores branching. We introduce \textbf{Prefix-to-Tree (P2T)}, a simple procedure that converts a group of responses into a prefix tree and computes \emph{nonparametric} prefix values \(V(s)\) by aggregating descendant outcomes. Built on P2T, we propose \textbf{TEMPO} (\emph{\textbf{T}ree-\textbf{E}stimated \textbf{M}ean Prefix Value for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization}), a critic-free algorithm that augments the group-relative outcome signal of GRPO with \emph{branch-gated} temporal-difference corrections derived from the tree. At non-branch tokens, the temporal-difference (TD) term is zero, so TEMPO reduces to GRPO; at branching tokens, it supplies precise token-level credit without a learned value network or extra judges/teachers. On Qwen3-1.7B/4B, TEMPO outperforms PPO and GRPO on in-distribution (MATH, MedQA) and out-of-distribution (GSM-HARD, AMC23, MedMCQA, MMLU-Medical) benchmarks, and reaches higher validation accuracy with roughly the same wall-clock time.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Fine-Tuning Robot Policies While Maintaining User Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18311v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works introduce general-purpose robot policies. These policies provide a strong prior over how robots should behave -- e.g., how a robot arm should manipulate food items. But in order for robots to match an individual person's needs, users typically fine-tune these generalized policies -- e.g., showing the robot arm how to make their own preferred dinners. Importantly, during the process of personalizing robots, end-users leak data about their preferences, habits, and styles (e.g., the foods they prefer to eat). Other agents can simply roll-out the fine-tuned policy and see these personally-trained behaviors. This leads to a fundamental challenge: how can we develop robots that personalize actions while keeping learning private from external agents? We here explore this emerging topic in human-robot interaction and develop PRoP, a model-agnostic framework for personalized and private robot policies. Our core idea is to equip each user with a unique key; this key is then used to mathematically transform the weights of the robot's network. With the correct key, the robot's policy switches to match that user's preferences -- but with incorrect keys, the robot reverts to its baseline behaviors. We show the general applicability of our method across multiple model types in imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and classification tasks. PRoP is practically advantageous because it retains the architecture and behaviors of the original policy, and experimentally outperforms existing encoder-based approaches.

| **[Strategic Coordination for Evolving Multi-agent Systems: A Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18088v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized combinatorial optimization in evolving multi-agent systems poses significant challenges, requiring agents to balance long-term decision-making, short-term optimized collective outcomes, while preserving autonomy of interactive agents under unanticipated changes. Reinforcement learning offers a way to model sequential decision-making through dynamic programming to anticipate future environmental changes. However, applying multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to decentralized combinatorial optimization problems remains an open challenge due to the exponential growth of the joint state-action space, high communication overhead, and privacy concerns in centralized training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning (HRCL), a novel approach that leverages both MARL and decentralized collective learning based on a hierarchical framework. Agents take high-level strategies using MARL to group possible plans for action space reduction and constrain the agent behavior for Pareto optimality. Meanwhile, the low-level collective learning layer ensures efficient and decentralized coordinated decisions among agents with minimal communication. Extensive experiments in a synthetic scenario and real-world smart city application models, including energy self-management and drone swarm sensing, demonstrate that HRCL significantly improves performance, scalability, and adaptability compared to the standalone MARL and collective learning approaches, achieving a win-win synthesis solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on games or isolated puzzles, Reasoning Core procedurally generates problems across core formal domains, including PDDL planning, first-order logic, context-free grammar parsing, causal reasoning, and system equation solving. The environment is built on key design principles of high-generality problem distributions, verification via external tools, and continuous difficulty control, which together provide a virtually infinite supply of novel training instances. Initial zero-shot evaluations with frontier LLMs confirm the difficulty of Reasoning Core's tasks, positioning it as a promising resource to improve the reasoning capabilities of future models.</p></details> |  |

We reveal that existing reinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with large temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and limited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate solutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth annotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance, effectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy solutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based updates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method that dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation. By employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1 optimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference modes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms GRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions (R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%). Moreover, TempSamp-R1 shows robust few-shot generalization capabilities under limited data.

We present HuMam, a state-centric end-to-end RL framework that employs a single-layer Mamba encoder to fuse robot-centric states with oriented footstep targets and a continuous phase clock. The policy outputs joint position targets tracked by a low-level PD loop and is optimized with PPO. A concise six-term reward balances contact quality, swing smoothness, foot placement, posture, and body stability while implicitly promoting energy saving. On the JVRC-1 humanoid in mc-mujoco, HuMam consistently improves learning efficiency, training stability, and overall task performance over a strong feedforward baseline, while reducing power consumption and torque peaks. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end humanoid RL controller that adopts Mamba as the fusion backbone, demonstrating tangible gains in efficiency, stability, and control economy.</p></details> | 10 pages |

While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with three key contributions: 1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3. Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for selecting memory models in RL tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ComposableNav: Instruction-Following Navigation in Dynamic Environments via Composable Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17941v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers the problem of enabling robots to navigate dynamic environments while following instructions. The challenge lies in the combinatorial nature of instruction specifications: each instruction can include multiple specifications, and the number of possible specification combinations grows exponentially as the robot's skill set expands. For example, "overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road" consists of two specifications: "overtake the pedestrian" and "walk on the right side of the road." To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the intuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its constituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive. Using diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then composes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of specifications unseen in training. Additionally, to avoid the onerous need for demonstrations of individual motion primitives, we propose a two-stage training procedure: (1) supervised pre-training to learn a base diffusion model for dynamic navigation, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning that molds the base model into different motion primitives. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we show that ComposableNav enables robots to follow instructions by generating trajectories that satisfy diverse and unseen combinations of specifications, significantly outperforming both non-compositional VLM-based policies and costmap composing baselines.

Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels, enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech to health misinformation</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce Orcust, a framework that integrates Principle-Constrained Reward Modeling (PCRM) and Online VM-Grounded Trajectory Construction (OVTC) to enhance reasoning reliability and data efficiency in interactive GUI tasks. We leverages environment-verifiable and LLM-derived principle to enforce interpretable reward signals that constrain long chain-of-thought reasoning and rule-based feedback. OVTC spins up instrumented virtual machines to autonomously collect structured GUI interaction trajectories with explicit procedural and structural objectives, enabling the training of a stepwise reward model that robustly captures human preferences and adheres to task-specific constraints. Extensive experiments on standard GUI benchmarks covering perceptual grounding, foundational operations, and end-to-end task execution reveal that Orcust achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving by 22.2\% on ScreenSpot and 23.9\% on ScreenSpot-Pro over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The results demonstrate Orcust's effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning, adaptability and scalability of GUI agents across various environments and task complexities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sight Over Site: Perception-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Robotic Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17877v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous inspection is a central problem in robotics, with applications ranging from industrial monitoring to search-and-rescue. Traditionally, inspection has often been reduced to navigation tasks, where the objective is to reach a predefined location while avoiding obstacles. However, this formulation captures only part of the real inspection problem. In real-world environments, the inspection targets may become visible well before their exact coordinates are reached, making further movement both redundant and inefficient. What matters more for inspection is not simply arriving at the target's position, but positioning the robot at a viewpoint from which the target becomes observable. In this work, we revisit inspection from a perception-aware perspective. We propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that explicitly incorporates target visibility as the primary objective, enabling the robot to find the shortest trajectory that guarantees visual contact with the target without relying on a map. The learned policy leverages both perceptual and proprioceptive sensing and is trained entirely in simulation, before being deployed to a real-world robot. We further develop an algorithm to compute ground-truth shortest inspection paths, which provides a reference for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method outperforms existing classical and learning-based navigation approaches, yielding more efficient inspection trajectories in both simulated and real-world settings.

Each customer suggests several time slots for their maintenance task, from which the OEM must select one. This decision needs to be made promptly to support customers' planning. At the end of each day, routes for service engineers are planned to fulfill the tasks scheduled for the following day. We study this hierarchical and sequential decision-making problem-the Dynamic Time Slot Assignment Problem with Commitments and Customer Preferences (DTSAP-CCP)-in this paper. Methodology/results: Two distinct approaches are proposed: 1) an attention-based deep reinforcement learning with rollout execution (ADRL-RE) and 2) a scenario-based planning approach (SBP). The ADRL-RE combines a well-trained attention-based neural network with a rollout framework for online trajectory simulation. To support the training, we develop a neural heuristic solver that provides rapid route planning solutions, enabling efficient learning in complex combinatorial settings. The SBP approach samples several scenarios to guide the time slot assignment. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of ADRL-RE and the stability of SBP compared to both rule-based and rollout-based approaches. Furthermore, the strong practicality of ADRL-RE is verified in a case study of after-sales service for large medical equipment. Implications: This study provides OEMs with practical decision-support tools for dynamic maintenance scheduling, balancing customer preferences and operational efficiency. In particular, our ADRL-RE shows strong real-world potential, supporting timely and customer-aligned maintenance scheduling.</p></details> |  |

This learning paradigm is, however, well-known for being time-consuming due to the necessity of collecting a large amount of data, making RL suffer from sample inefficiency and difficult generalization. Furthermore, the construction of an explicit reward function that accounts for the trade-off between multiple desiderata of a decision problem is often a laborious task. These challenges have been recently addressed utilizing transfer and inverse reinforcement learning (T-IRL). In this regard, this paper is devoted to a comprehensive review of realizing the sample efficiency and generalization of RL algorithms through T-IRL. Following a brief introduction to RL, the fundamental T-IRL methods are presented and the most recent advancements in each research field have been extensively reviewed. Our findings denote that a majority of recent research works have dealt with the aforementioned challenges by utilizing human-in-the-loop and sim-to-real strategies for the efficient transfer of knowledge from source domains to the target domain under the transfer learning scheme. Under the IRL structure, training schemes that require a low number of experience transitions and extension of such frameworks to multi-agent and multi-intention problems have been the priority of researchers in recent years.</p></details> |  |
| **[SocialTraj: Two-Stage Socially-Aware Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving via Conditional Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17850v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles (SVs) is crucial for autonomous driving systems to avoid misguided decisions and potential accidents. However, achieving reliable predictions in highly dynamic and complex traffic scenarios remains a significant challenge. One of the key impediments lies in the limited effectiveness of current approaches to capture the multi-modal behaviors of drivers, which leads to predicted trajectories that deviate from actual future motions. To address this issue, we propose SocialTraj, a novel trajectory prediction framework integrating social psychology principles through social value orientation (SVO). By utilizing Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate the SVO of SVs, we obtain the critical social context to infer the future interaction trend. To ensure modal consistency in predicted behaviors, the estimated SVOs of SVs are embedded into a conditional denoising diffusion model that aligns generated trajectories with historical driving styles. Additionally, the planned future trajectory of the ego vehicle (EV) is explicitly incorporated to enhance interaction modeling. Extensive experiments on NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that SocialTraj is capable of adapting to highly dynamic and interactive scenarios while generating socially compliant and behaviorally consistent trajectory predictions, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that dynamic SVO estimation and explicit ego-planning components notably improve prediction accuracy and substantially reduce inference time.</p></details> |  |

Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems must robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware configurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered, task-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new scenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have shown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as manipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction machinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified open-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining, and fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first trained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then fine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through both simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy, successfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance comparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation, we demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while maintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results highlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and generalizable autonomous excavation.</p></details> |  |

These two aspects influence the agent's ability to make well-informed and time-consistent decisions when facing testing environments. In this work, we devise a framework to solve robust risk-aware RL problems where we simultaneously account for environmental uncertainty and risk with a class of dynamic robust distortion risk measures. Robustness is introduced by considering all models within a Wasserstein ball around a reference model. We estimate such dynamic robust risk measures using neural networks by making use of strictly consistent scoring functions, derive policy gradient formulae using the quantile representation of distortion risk measures, and construct an actor-critic algorithm to solve this class of robust risk-aware RL problems. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a portfolio allocation example.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

To address such challenges, researchers proposed the multi-agent manufacturing system. However, conventional agent negotiation typically relies on pre-defined and fixed heuristic rules, which are ill-suited to managing complex and fluctuating disturbances. In current implementations, mainstream approaches based on reinforcement learning require the development of simulators and training models specific to a given shopfloor, necessitating substantial computational resources and lacking scalability. To overcome this limitation, the present study proposes a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor management. By defining the diverse modules of agents and their collaborative methods, this system facilitates the processing of all workpieces with minimal human intervention. The agents in this system consist of the Machine Server Module (MSM), Bid Inviter Module (BIM), Bidder Module (BM), Thinking Module (TM), and Decision Module (DM). By harnessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, these modules enable agents to dynamically analyze shopfloor information and select appropriate processing machines. The LLM-based modules, predefined by system prompts, provide dynamic functionality for the system without the need for pre-training. Extensive experiments were conducted in physical shopfloor settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed system exhibits strong adaptability, and achieves superior performance (makespan) and stability (as measured by sample standard deviation) compared to other approaches without requiring pre-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards General Computer Control with Hierarchical Agents and Multi-Level Action Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18230v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling desktop applications via software remains a fundamental yet under-served problem. Existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) ingest screenshots and task instructions to generate keystrokes and mouse events, but they suffer from prohibitive inference latency, poor sample efficiency on long-horizon sparse-reward tasks, and infeasible on-device deployment. We introduce a lightweight hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, ComputerAgent, that formulates OS control as a two-level option process (manager and subpolicy), employs a triple-modal state encoder (screenshot, task ID, numeric state) to handle visual and contextual diversity, integrates meta-actions with an early-stop mechanism to reduce wasted interactions, and uses a compact vision backbone plus small policy networks for on-device inference (15M parameters). On a suite of 135 real-world desktop tasks, ComputerAgent attains 92.1% success on simple tasks (<8 steps) and 58.8% on hard tasks (>=8 steps), matching or exceeding 200B-parameter MLLM baselines on simple scenarios while reducing model size by over four orders of magnitude and halving inference time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical RL offers a practical, scalable alternative to monolithic MLLM-based automation for computer control.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConfClip: Confidence-Weighted and Clipped Reward for Reinforcement Learning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17730v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a standard paradigm for refining large language models (LLMs) beyond pre-training and instruction tuning. A prominent line of work is RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which leverages automatically verifiable outcomes (e.g., correctness or executability) to generate reward signals. While efficient, this framework faces two key limitations: First, its binary feedback is too sparse to capture the quality of the reasoning process. Second, its coarse-grained rewards potentially lead to vanishing gradients. Inspired by observations from human learning, we introduce a RL technique that integrates verifiable outcomes with the model's own confidence estimates. This joint design enriches the reward signal, providing finer-grained feedback and implicitly supervising the reasoning process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method enhances RL performance across multiple datasets and reduces token consumption during inference, while incurring negligible additional training cost. Moreover, it can be used as a plug-in module to enhance other state-of-the-art RL methods.</p></details> |  |

Mitigating OCR Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20168v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced document understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However, existing models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world scenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the current response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation and ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned visual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently results in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise answer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and problem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR hallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test samples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world degradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models' capacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and answer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding hallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and thereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based framework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness of visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer to increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model achieves a 22\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o on KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks, highlighting both effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, crucial for enhancing large model post-training, cannot adapt to decentralized distributed training due to the tight coupling between parameter learning and rollout sampling. For this, we propose HeteroRL, a heterogeneous RL architecture that decouples these processes, enabling stable training across geographically distributed nodes connected via the Internet. The core component is Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), an asynchronous RL algorithm robust to latency caused by network delays or heterogeneity in computational resources. Our study reveals that high latency significantly increases KL divergence, leading to higher variance in importance sampling weights and training instability. GEPO mitigates this issue by using group expectation weighting to exponentially reduce the variance of importance weights, with theoretical guarantees. Experiments show that GEPO achieves superior stability, with only a 3\% performance drop from online to 1800s latency, demonstrating strong potential for decentralized RL in geographically distributed, resource-heterogeneous computing environments.</p></details> |  |

Purely template-based or end-to-end reinforcement learning-based methods suffer from such harsh terrains. This paper proposes a two stage training framework for such narrow path traversing tasks, coupling a template-based foothold planner with a low-level foothold tracker from Stage-I training and a lightweight perception aided foothold modifier from Stage-II training. With the curriculum setup from flat ground to narrow paths across stages, the resulted controller in turn learns to robustly track and safely modify foothold targets to ensure precise foot placement over narrow paths. This framework preserves the interpretability from the physics-based template and takes advantage of the generalization capability from reinforcement learning, resulting in easy sim-to-real transfer. The learned policies outperform purely template-based or reinforcement learning-based baselines in terms of success rate, centerline adherence and safety margins. Validation on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot yields successful traversal of a 0.2m wide and 3m long beam for 20 trials without any failure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://huangtc233.github.io/Traversing-the-Narrow-Path/</p></details> |
| **[RSU-Assisted Resource Allocation for Collaborative Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17691v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a pivotal technology for autonomous driving, collaborative perception enables vehicular agents to exchange perceptual data through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, thereby enhancing perception accuracy of all collaborators. However, existing collaborative perception frameworks often assume ample communication resources, which is usually impractical in real-world vehicular networks. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the problem of communication resource allocation for collaborative perception and proposes RACooper, a novel RSU-assisted resource allocation framework that maximizes perception accuracy under constrained communication resources. RACooper leverages a hierarchical reinforcement learning model to dynamically allocate communication resources while accounting for real-time sensing data and channel dynamics induced by vehicular mobility. By jointly optimizing spatial confidence metrics and channel state information, our approach ensures efficient feature transmission, enhancing the effectiveness of collaborative perception. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to conventional baseline algorithms, RACooper achieves significant improvements in perception accuracy, especially under bandwidth-constrained scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Learning Boulder Excavation with Hydraulic Excavators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17683v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Construction sites frequently require removing large rocks before excavation or grading can proceed. Human operators typically extract these boulders using only standard digging buckets, avoiding time-consuming tool changes to specialized grippers. This task demands manipulating irregular objects with unknown geometries in harsh outdoor environments where dust, variable lighting, and occlusions hinder perception. The excavator must adapt to varying soil resistance--dragging along hard-packed surfaces or penetrating soft ground--while coordinating multiple hydraulic joints to secure rocks using a shovel. Current autonomous excavation focuses on continuous media (soil, gravel) or uses specialized grippers with detailed geometric planning for discrete objects. These approaches either cannot handle large irregular rocks or require impractical tool changes that interrupt workflow. We train a reinforcement learning policy in simulation using rigid-body dynamics and analytical soil models. The policy processes sparse LiDAR points (just 20 per rock) from vision-based segmentation and proprioceptive feedback to control standard excavator buckets. The learned agent discovers different strategies based on soil resistance: dragging along the surface in hard soil and penetrating directly in soft conditions. Field tests on a 12-ton excavator achieved 70% success across varied rocks (0.4-0.7m) and soil types, compared to 83% for human operators. This demonstrates that standard construction equipment can learn complex manipulation despite sparse perception and challenging outdoor conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving high energy efficiency in such networks remains a critical challenge, particularly in large-scale or dynamically changing environments. Traditional terrestrial LoRa deployments often suffer from coverage gaps and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation losses, while satellite-based IoT solutions consume excessive energy and introduce high latency, limiting their suitability for energy-constrained and delay-sensitive applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying LoRa gateways to dynamically collect data from ground-based LoRa end devices. Our approach aims to maximize the system's weighted global energy efficiency by jointly optimizing spreading factors, transmission powers, UAV trajectories, and end-device associations. Additionally, we formulate this complex optimization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose green LoRa multi-agent proximal policy optimization (GLo-MAPPO), a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). Simulation results show that GLo-MAPPO significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms, achieving energy efficiency improvements of 71.25%, 18.56%, 67.00%, 59.73%, and 49.95% for networks with 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 LoRa end devices, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 19 figures, journal</p></details> |

Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback, trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods, achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achieved a PSNR of 41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to 94%, achieving 4% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based denoising.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Such \emph{dynamic} dependencies (and corresponding dynamic tensor shapes) are difficult to express and optimize: while \emph{eager} DL systems support such dynamism, they cannot apply compiler-based optimizations; \emph{graph-based} systems require static tensor shapes, which forces users to pad tensors or break-up programs into multiple static graphs. We describe Tempo, a new DL system that combines the dynamism of eager execution with the whole-program optimizations of graph-based compilation. Tempo achieves this through a declarative programming model with \emph{recurrent tensors}, which include explicit \emph{temporal dimensions}. Temporal dimensions can be indexed using \emph{symbolic expressions} to express dynamic dependencies on past and future tensors. Based on this, Tempo constructs a \emph{symbolic dependence graph}, which concisely encodes dynamic dependencies between operators, and applies whole-program optimizations, such as algebraic simplifications, vectorization, tiling, and fusion. By tiling dynamic dependencies into static-size blocks, Tempo can also reuse existing static code-generators. It then uses a polyhedral model to find a feasible execution schedule, which includes memory management operations. We show that Tempo achieves a 7$\times$ speedup over JAX for Llama-3.2-3B decoding; for reinforcement learning algorithms, Tempo achieves a 54$\times$ speedup, with 16$\times$ lower peak memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 24 figures, 3 bibliography pages</p></details> |

A central challenge of this task lies in accurately handling complex tables -- those with large sizes, deeply nested structures, and semantically rich or irregular cell content -- where existing methods often fail. We begin with a comprehensive analysis, identifying key challenges and highlighting the limitations of current evaluation protocols. To overcome these issues, we propose a reinforced multimodal large language model (MLLM) framework, where a pre-trained MLLM is fine-tuned on a large-scale table-to-LaTeX dataset. To further improve generation quality, we introduce a dual-reward reinforcement learning strategy based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike standard approaches that optimize purely over text outputs, our method incorporates both a structure-level reward on LaTeX code and a visual fidelity reward computed from rendered outputs, enabling direct optimization of the visual output quality. We adopt a hybrid evaluation protocol combining TEDS-Structure and CW-SSIM, and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on structurally complex tables, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Such methods often fail to scale, as every new problem or application requires time-consuming and iterative reward definition and tuning. We present Generalist Contact-Conditioned Policy (GeCCo) -- a low-level policy trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning that is capable of tracking arbitrary contact points on a quadruped robot. The strength of our approach is that it provides a general and modular low-level controller that can be reused for a wider range of high-level tasks, without the need to re-train new controllers from scratch. We demonstrate the scalability and robustness of our method by evaluating on a wide range of locomotion and manipulation tasks in a common framework and under a single generalist policy. These include a variety of gaits, traversing complex terrains (eg. stairs and slopes) as well as previously unseen stepping-stones and narrow beams, and interacting with objects (eg. pushing buttons, tracking trajectories). Our framework acquires new behaviors more efficiently, simply by combining a task-specific high-level contact planner and the pre-trained generalist policy.

Inspired by Test-Time Training (TTT) in large language models, we propose scaling TTT for CLMs to enhance chemical space exploration. We introduce MolExp, a novel benchmark emphasizing the discovery of structurally diverse molecules with similar bioactivity, simulating real-world drug design challenges. Our results demonstrate that scaling TTT by increasing the number of independent RL agents follows a log-linear scaling law, significantly improving exploration efficiency as measured by MolExp. In contrast, increasing TTT training time yields diminishing returns, even with exploration bonuses. We further evaluate cooperative RL strategies to enhance exploration efficiency. These findings provide a scalable framework for generative molecular design, offering insights into optimizing AI-driven drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dexterous Grasping with Real-World Robotic Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04014v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous grasping in the real world presents a fundamental and significant challenge for robot learning. The ability to employ affordance-aware poses to grasp objects with diverse geometries and properties in arbitrary scenarios is essential for general-purpose robots. However, existing research predominantly addresses dexterous grasping problems within simulators, which encounter difficulties when applied in real-world environments due to the domain gap between reality and simulation. This limitation hinders their generalizability and practicality in real-world applications. In this paper, we present DexGraspRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly trains robots in real-world environments to acquire dexterous grasping skills. Specifically, DexGraspRL consists of two stages: (i) a pretraining stage that pretrains the policy using imitation learning (IL) with a limited set of expert demonstrations; (ii) a fine-tuning stage that refines the policy through direct RL in real-world scenarios. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon arising from the distribution shift between demonstrations and real-world environments, we design a regularization term that balances the exploitation of RL with the preservation of the pretrained policy. Our experiments with real-world tasks demonstrate that DexGraspRL successfully accomplishes diverse dexterous grasping tasks, achieving an average success rate of nearly 92%. Furthermore, by fine-tuning with RL, our method uncovers novel policies, surpassing the IL policy with a 23% reduction in average cycle time.</p></details> |  |

Particularly in vision-intensive tasks like geometric reasoning, MLLMs hallucinate frequently, leading to inaccurate reasoning. We attribute this to the perceptual bottleneck in MLLMs, which caps the benefits of reasoning training. To quantify this, we design a Geo-Perception Question-Answering (GeoPQA) benchmark, targeting basic geometric concepts and spatial relationships. Experiments on GeoPQA reveal significant shortcomings of MLLMs in visual perception, which constrain RL reward signals for effective training. To address this bottleneck, we propose a two-stage RL training framework by first enhancing the visual perception of geometric structures, then fostering reasoning capabilities. Applied to Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, our two-stage training improves geometric reasoning by 9.7% and geometric problem solving by 9.1%, compared to the direct reasoning training approach. Our method also generalizes to other vision-intensive domains like figure understanding, highlighting the importance of perceptual grounding in effective MLLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP2025 Findings</p></details> |

Proportional integral derivative controllers remain standard but are highly sensitive to gain selection, with manual tuning often yielding suboptimal trade-offs. This paper studies different optimization techniques for the automated tuning of quadrotor proportional integral derivative gains under a unified simulation that couples a blade element momentum based aerodynamic model with a fast deep neural network surrogate, six degrees of freedom rigid body dynamics, turbulence, and a data driven acoustic surrogate model that predicts third octave spectra and propagates them to ground receivers. We compare three families of gradient-free optimizers: metaheuristics, Bayesian optimization, and deep reinforcement learning. Candidate controllers are evaluated using a composite cost function that incorporates multiple metrics, such as noise footprint and power consumption, simultaneously. Metaheuristics improve performance consistently, with Grey Wolf Optimization producing optimal results. Bayesian optimization is sample efficient but carries higher per iteration overhead and depends on the design domain. The reinforcement learning agents do not surpass the baseline in the current setup, suggesting the problem formulation requires further refinement. On unseen missions the best tuned controller maintains accurate tracking while reducing oscillations, power demand, and acoustic emissions. These results show that noise aware proportional integral derivative tuning through black box search can deliver quieter and more efficient flight without hardware changes.</p></details> | 47 pages, 13 figures |

Despite recent advancements in enhancing human-computer interaction within database applications, significant challenges persist, particularly regarding the inference performance in complex scenarios involving multi-table joins and nested queries. Current methodologies primarily utilize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train the NL2SQL model, which may limit adaptability and interpretability in new environments (e.g., finance and healthcare). In order to enhance the reasoning performance of the NL2SQL model in the above complex situations, we introduce SQL-R1, a novel NL2SQL reasoning model trained by the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. We design a specialized RL-based reward function tailored for NL2SQL tasks and discussed the impact of cold start on the effectiveness of intensive training. In addition, we achieve competitive accuracy using only a tiny amount of synthetic NL2SQL data for augmented training and further explore data engineering for RL. In existing experiments, SQL-R1 achieves execution accuracy of 88.6% and 66.6% on the benchmark Spider and BIRD, respectively, only using the 7B base model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepd by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Yet robot policies often lack sufficient exploration capability due to action mode collapse. Existing methods that encourage exploration typically rely on random perturbations, which are unsafe and induce unstable, erratic behaviors, thereby limiting their effectiveness. We propose Self-Improvement via On-Manifold Exploration (SOE), a framework that enhances policy exploration and improvement in robotic manipulation. SOE learns a compact latent representation of task-relevant factors and constrains exploration to the manifold of valid actions, ensuring safety, diversity, and effectiveness. It can be seamlessly integrated with arbitrary policy models as a plug-in module, augmenting exploration without degrading the base policy performance. Moreover, the structured latent space enables human-guided exploration, further improving efficiency and controllability. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks demonstrate that SOE consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving higher task success rates, smoother and safer exploration, and superior sample efficiency. These results establish on-manifold exploration as a principled approach to sample-efficient policy self-improvement. Project website: https://ericjin2002.github.io/SOE</p></details> |  |

Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to reliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot swarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that intermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully self-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network topologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently introduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are able to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing the problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in robot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel proactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on self-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network. Proactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur, adapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative positions. Reactively, robots use one-shot likelihood ratio tests to compare information received along different paths in the multiplex network, enabling early fault detection. Upon detection, communication is temporarily rerouted in a self-organized way, until the detected fault resolves. We validate the approach in representative scenarios of faulty positional data occurring during formation control, demonstrating that intermittent faults are prevented from disrupting convergence to desired formations, with high fault detection accuracy and low rates of false positives.</p></details> |  |

In this context, this study presents an occlusion-aware Consistent Model Predictive Control (CMPC) strategy. To account for the occluded obstacles, it incorporates adjustable risk regions that represent their potential future locations. Subsequently, dynamic risk boundary constraints are developed online to ensure safety. The CMPC then constructs multiple locally optimal trajectory branches (each tailored to different risk regions) to strike a balance between safety and performance. A shared consensus segment is generated to ensure smooth transitions between branches without significant velocity fluctuations, further preserving motion consistency. To facilitate high computational efficiency and ensure coordination across local trajectories, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the CMPC into manageable sub-problems for parallel solving. The proposed strategy is validated through simulations and real-world experiments on an Ackermann-steering robot platform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CMPC strategy through comparisons with baseline approaches in occluded, obstacle-dense environments.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces MagiClaw, a versatile two-finger end-effector designed to bridge this gap. MagiClaw functions interchangeably as both a handheld tool for intuitive data collection and a robotic end-effector for policy deployment, ensuring hardware consistency and reliability. Each finger incorporates a Soft Polyhedral Network (SPN) with an embedded camera, enabling vision-based estimation of 6-DoF forces and contact deformation. This proprioceptive data is fused with exteroceptive environmental sensing from an integrated iPhone, which provides 6D pose, RGB video, and LiDAR-based depth maps. Through a custom iOS application, MagiClaw streams synchronized, multi-modal data for real-time teleoperation, offline policy learning, and immersive control via mixed-reality interfaces.

While several robotic platforms have been used in gerontological healthcare, the question of whether or not a social interactive robot with multi-modal conversational capabilities will be useful and accepted in real-life facilities is yet to be answered. This paper is an attempt to partially answer this question, via two waves of experiments with patients and companions in a day-care gerontological facility in Paris with a full-sized humanoid robot endowed with social and conversational interaction capabilities. The software architecture, developed during the H2020 SPRING project, together with the experimental protocol, allowed us to evaluate the acceptability (AES) and usability (SUS) with more than 60 end-users. Overall, the users are receptive to this technology, especially when the robot perception and action skills are robust to environmental clutter and flexible to handle a plethora of different interactions.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, we introduce FunCanon, a framework that converts long-horizon manipulation tasks into sequences of action chunks, each defined by an actor, verb, and object. These chunks focus policy learning on the actions themselves, rather than isolated tasks, enabling compositionality and reuse. To make policies pose-aware and category-general, we perform functional object canonicalization for functional alignment and automatic manipulation trajectory transfer, mapping objects into shared functional frames using affordance cues from large vision language models. An object centric and action centric diffusion policy FuncDiffuser trained on this aligned data naturally respects object affordances and poses, simplifying learning and improving generalization ability. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate category-level generalization, cross-task behavior reuse, and robust sim2real deployment, showing that functional canonicalization provides a strong inductive bias for scalable imitation learning in complex manipulation domains.

Reinforcement learning can refine polices to alleviate this limitation, yet real-robot training is costly and unsafe, while training in simulators suffers from the sim-to-real gap. Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in real-world simulation, with diffusion models in particular excelling at generation. This raises the question of how diffusion model-based world models can be combined to enhance pre-trained policies in robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose World4RL, a framework that employs diffusion-based world models as high-fidelity simulators to refine pre-trained policies entirely in imagined environments for robotic manipulation. Unlike prior works that primarily employ world models for planning, our framework enables direct end-to-end policy optimization. World4RL is designed around two principles: pre-training a diffusion world model that captures diverse dynamics on multi-task datasets and refining policies entirely within a frozen world model to avoid online real-world interactions. We further design a two-hot action encoding scheme tailored for robotic manipulation and adopt diffusion backbones to improve modeling fidelity. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that World4RL provides high-fidelity environment modeling and enables consistent policy refinement, yielding significantly higher success rates compared to imitation learning and other baselines.

Offline Imitation learning (IL) avoids these risks by collecting expert demonstrations safely, training entirely offline, and deploying policies zero-shot. However, we find that naively applying Behaviour Cloning (BC) to social navigation is insufficient; achieving strong performance requires careful architectural and training choices. We present Ratatouille, a pipeline and model architecture that, without changing the data, reduces collisions per meter by 6 times and improves success rate by 3 times compared to naive BC. We validate our approach in both simulation and the real world, where we collected over 11 hours of data on a dense university campus. We further demonstrate qualitative results in a public food court. Our findings highlight that thoughtful IL design, rather than additional data, can substantially improve safety and reliability in real-world social navigation. Video: https://youtu.be/tOdLTXsaYLQ.

Previous work within the dominant pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has explored parameter-efficient fine-tuning for single-task adaptation, effectively steering a frozen pretrained model with a small number of parameters. However, in the context of lifelong learning, these methods rely on the impractical assumption of a test-time task identifier and restrict knowledge sharing among isolated adapters. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Mixture of Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library (DMPEL) for lifelong robot learning. DMPEL progressively builds a low-rank expert library and employs a lightweight router to dynamically combine experts into an end-to-end policy, enabling flexible and efficient lifelong forward transfer. Furthermore, by leveraging the modular structure of the fine-tuned parameters, we introduce expert coefficient replay, which guides the router to accurately retrieve frozen experts for previously encountered tasks. This technique mitigates forgetting while being significantly more storage- and computation-efficient than experience replay over the entire policy. Extensive experiments on the lifelong robot learning benchmark LIBERO demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods in success rates during continual adaptation, while utilizing minimal trainable parameters and storage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lang2Morph: Language-Driven Morphological Design of Robotic Hands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18937v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing robotic hand morphologies for diverse manipulation tasks requires balancing dexterity, manufacturability, and task-specific functionality. While open-source frameworks and parametric tools support reproducible design, they still rely on expert heuristics and manual tuning. Automated methods using optimization are often compute-intensive, simulation-dependent, and rarely target dexterous hands. Large language models (LLMs), with their broad knowledge of human-object interactions and strong generative capabilities, offer a promising alternative for zero-shot design reasoning. In this paper, we present Lang2Morph, a language-driven pipeline for robotic hand design. It uses LLMs to translate natural-language task descriptions into symbolic structures and OPH-compatible parameters, enabling 3D-printable task-specific morphologies. The pipeline consists of: (i) Morphology Design, which maps tasks into semantic tags, structural grammars, and OPH-compatible parameters; and (ii) Selection and Refinement, which evaluates design candidates based on semantic alignment and size compatibility, and optionally applies LLM-guided refinement when needed. We evaluate Lang2Morph across varied tasks, and results show that our approach can generate diverse, task-relevant morphologies. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop an LLM-based framework for task-conditioned robotic hand design.</p></details> |  |

Initial access can be achieved by exploiting the BLE provisioning protocol which contains a critical command injection vulnerability allowing root access via malformed Wi-Fi credentials, exploitable using hardcoded AES keys shared across all units. Partial reverse engineering of Unitree's proprietary FMX encryption reveal a static Blowfish-ECB layer and a predictable LCG mask-enabled inspection of the system's otherwise sophisticated security architecture, the most mature we have observed in commercial robotics. Two empirical case studies expose the critical risk of this humanoid robot: (a) the robot functions as a trojan horse, continuously exfiltrating multi-modal sensor and service-state telemetry to 43.175.228.18:17883 and 43.175.229.18:17883 every 300 seconds without operator notice, creating violations of GDPR Articles 6 and 13; (b) a resident Cybersecurity AI (CAI) agent can pivot from reconnaissance to offensive preparation against any target, such as the manufacturer's cloud control plane, demonstrating escalation from passive monitoring to active counter-operations. These findings argue for adaptive CAI-powered defenses as humanoids move into critical infrastructure, contributing the empirical evidence needed to shape future security standards for physical-cyber convergence systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Video-Based Robot Failure Detection Using Task Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18705v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend, in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code and annotations are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECMR 2025</p></details> |

Replicating these tactile sensing capabilities for dexterous robotic manipulation systems remains a longstanding challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by introducing DexSkin. DexSkin is a soft, conformable capacitive electronic skin that enables sensitive, localized, and calibratable tactile sensing, and can be tailored to varying geometries. We demonstrate its efficacy for learning downstream robotic manipulation by sensorizing a pair of parallel jaw gripper fingers, providing tactile coverage across almost the entire finger surfaces. We empirically evaluate DexSkin's capabilities in learning challenging manipulation tasks that require sensing coverage across the entire surface of the fingers, such as reorienting objects in hand and wrapping elastic bands around boxes, in a learning-from-demonstration framework. We then show that, critically for data-driven approaches, DexSkin can be calibrated to enable model transfer across sensor instances, and demonstrate its applicability to online reinforcement learning on real robots. Our results highlight DexSkin's suitability and practicality for learning real-world, contact-rich manipulation.

While existing approaches mainly focus on policy design, they often neglect the structure and capacity of visual encoders, limiting spatial understanding and generalization. Inspired by biological vision systems, which rely on both visual and proprioceptive cues for robust control, we propose VGGT-DP, a visuomotor policy framework that integrates geometric priors from a pretrained 3D perception model with proprioceptive feedback. We adopt the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) as the visual encoder and introduce a proprioception-guided visual learning strategy to align perception with internal robot states, improving spatial grounding and closed-loop control. To reduce inference latency, we design a frame-wise token reuse mechanism that compacts multi-view tokens into an efficient spatial representation. We further apply random token pruning to enhance policy robustness and reduce overfitting. Experiments on challenging MetaWorld tasks show that VGGT-DP significantly outperforms strong baselines such as DP and DP3, particularly in precision-critical and long-horizon scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Dual Iterative Learning Control for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Dynamics with Validation in Robotic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18723v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving motion tasks autonomously and accurately is a core ability for intelligent real-world systems. To achieve genuine autonomy across multiple systems and tasks, key challenges include coping with unknown dynamics and overcoming the need for manual parameter tuning, which is especially crucial in complex Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. This paper presents MIMO Dual Iterative Learning Control (DILC), a novel data-driven iterative learning scheme for simultaneous tracking control and model learning, without requiring any prior system knowledge or manual parameter tuning. The method is designed for repetitive MIMO systems and integrates seamlessly with established iterative learning control methods. We provide monotonic convergence conditions for both reference tracking error and model error in linear time-invariant systems. The DILC scheme -- rapidly and autonomously -- solves various motion tasks in high-fidelity simulations of an industrial robot and in multiple nonlinear real-world MIMO systems, without requiring model knowledge or manually tuning the algorithm. In our experiments, many reference tracking tasks are solved within 10-20 trials, and even complex motions are learned in less than 100 iterations. We believe that, because of its rapid and autonomous learning capabilities, DILC has the potential to serve as an efficient building block within complex learning frameworks for intelligent real-world systems.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Query-Centric Diffusion Policy for Generalizable Robotic Assembly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18686v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The robotic assembly task poses a key challenge in building generalist robots due to the intrinsic complexity of part interactions and the sensitivity to noise perturbations in contact-rich settings. The assembly agent is typically designed in a hierarchical manner: high-level multi-part reasoning and low-level precise control. However, implementing such a hierarchical policy is challenging in practice due to the mismatch between high-level skill queries and low-level execution. To address this, we propose the Query-centric Diffusion Policy (QDP), a hierarchical framework that bridges high-level planning and low-level control by utilizing queries comprising objects, contact points, and skill information. QDP introduces a query-centric mechanism that identifies task-relevant components and uses them to guide low-level policies, leveraging point cloud observations to improve the policy's robustness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the FurnitureBench in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating improved performance in skill precision and long-horizon success rate. In the challenging insertion and screwing tasks, QDP improves the skill-wise success rate by over 50% compared to baselines without structured queries.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[LCMF: Lightweight Cross-Modality Mambaformer for Embodied Robotics VQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18576v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal semantic learning plays a critical role in embodied intelligence, especially when robots perceive their surroundings, understand human instructions, and make intelligent decisions. However, the field faces technical challenges such as effective fusion of heterogeneous data and computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes the lightweight LCMF cascaded attention framework, introducing a multi-level cross-modal parameter sharing mechanism into the Mamba module. By integrating the advantages of Cross-Attention and Selective parameter-sharing State Space Models (SSMs), the framework achieves efficient fusion of heterogeneous modalities and semantic complementary alignment. Experimental results show that LCMF surpasses existing multimodal baselines with an accuracy of 74.29% in VQA tasks and achieves competitive mid-tier performance within the distribution cluster of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents) in EQA video tasks. Its lightweight design achieves a 4.35-fold reduction in FLOPs relative to the average of comparable baselines while using only 166.51M parameters (image-text) and 219M parameters (video-text), providing an efficient solution for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) applications in resource-constrained scenarios with strong multimodal decision generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we developed a new reward function mutation framework that is based on applying Gaussian noise to the weights of the different terms in the reward function. Inspired by the cost-benefit tradeoff model from human motor control, we designed the reward function with the following key terms: accuracy, time, and effort. The study was performed in a simulation environment created in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and the setup included Franka Emika Panda robotic arm holding a glass with a liquid that needed to be poured into a container. The reinforcement learning algorithm was based on Proximal Policy Optimization. We systematically explored how different configurations of mutated weights in the rewards function would affect the learned policy. The resulting policies exhibit a wide range of behaviours: from variations in execution of the originally intended pouring task to novel skills useful for unexpected tasks, such as container rim cleaning, liquid mixing, and watering. This approach offers promising directions for robotic systems to perform diversified learning of specific tasks, while also potentially deriving meaningful skills for future tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Counterfactual Reasoning Framework for Fault Diagnosis in Robot Perception Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18460v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perception systems provide a rich understanding of the environment for autonomous systems, shaping decisions in all downstream modules. Hence, accurate detection and isolation of faults in perception systems is important. Faults in perception systems pose particular challenges: faults are often tied to the perceptual context of the environment, and errors in their multi-stage pipelines can propagate across modules. To address this, we adopt a counterfactual reasoning approach to propose a framework for fault detection and isolation (FDI) in perception systems. As opposed to relying on physical redundancy (i.e., having extra sensors), our approach utilizes analytical redundancy with counterfactual reasoning to construct perception reliability tests as causal outcomes influenced by system states and fault scenarios. Counterfactual reasoning generates reliability test results under hypothesized faults to update the belief over fault hypotheses. We derive both passive and active FDI methods. While the passive FDI can be achieved by belief updates, the active FDI approach is defined as a causal bandit problem, where we utilize Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with upper confidence bound (UCB) to find control inputs that maximize a detection and isolation metric, designated as Effective Information (EI). The mentioned metric quantifies the informativeness of control inputs for FDI. We demonstrate the approach in a robot exploration scenario, where a space robot performing vision-based navigation actively adjusts its attitude to increase EI and correctly isolate faults caused by sensor damage, dynamic scenes, and perceptual degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrioriTouch: Adapting to User Contact Preferences for Whole-Arm Physical Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18447v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) requires robots to adapt to individual contact preferences, such as where and how much force is applied. Identifying preferences is difficult for a single contact; with whole-arm interaction involving multiple simultaneous contacts between the robot and human, the challenge is greater because different body parts can impose incompatible force requirements. In caregiving tasks, where contact is frequent and varied, such conflicts are unavoidable. With multiple preferences across multiple contacts, no single solution can satisfy all objectives--trade-offs are inherent, making prioritization essential. We present PrioriTouch, a framework for ranking and executing control objectives across multiple contacts. PrioriTouch can prioritize from a general collection of controllers, making it applicable not only to caregiving scenarios such as bed bathing and dressing but also to broader multi-contact settings. Our method combines a novel learning-to-rank approach with hierarchical operational space control, leveraging simulation-in-the-loop rollouts for data-efficient and safe exploration. We conduct a user study on physical assistance preferences, derive personalized comfort thresholds, and incorporate them into PrioriTouch. We evaluate PrioriTouch through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating its ability to adapt to user contact preferences, maintain task performance, and enhance safety and comfort.

Yet, deploying LLM-driven planning in the physical world demands strict adherence to safety and regulatory constraints, which current models often violate due to hallucination or weak alignment. Traditional data-driven alignment methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), require costly human labeling, while recent formal-feedback approaches still depend on resource-intensive fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose LAD-VF, a fine-tuning-free framework that leverages formal verification feedback for automated prompt engineering. By introducing a formal-verification-informed text loss integrated with LLM-AutoDiff, LAD-VF iteratively refines prompts rather than model parameters. This yields three key benefits: (i) scalable adaptation without fine-tuning; (ii) compatibility with modular LLM architectures; and (iii) interpretable refinement via auditable prompts. Experiments in robot navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate that LAD-VF substantially enhances specification compliance, improving success rates from 60% to over 90%. Our method thus presents a scalable and interpretable pathway toward trustworthy, formally-verified LLM-driven control systems.</p></details> |  |

We propose a semantic particle filter that incorporates stable object-level detections, specifically vine trunks and support poles into the likelihood estimation process. Detected landmarks are projected into a birds eye view and fused with LiDAR scans to generate semantic observations. A key innovation is the use of semantic walls, which connect adjacent landmarks into pseudo-structural constraints that mitigate row aliasing. To maintain global consistency in headland regions where semantics are sparse, we introduce a noisy GPS prior that adaptively supports the filter. Experiments in a real vineyard demonstrate that our approach maintains localisation within the correct row, recovers from deviations where AMCL fails, and outperforms vision-based SLAM methods such as RTAB-Map.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sumbi...</summary><p>Sumbitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |

Some of that collaboration is achieved through the motion of the manipulated object itself, which we call "haptic communication." In this work, we captured the motion of human-human dyads moving an object together with one participant leading a motion plan about which the follower is uninformed. We then captured the same human participants manipulating the same object with a robot collaborator. By tracking the motion of the shared object using a low-cost IMU, we can directly compare human-human shared manipulation to the motion of those same participants interacting with the robot. Intra-study and post-study questionnaires provided participant feedback on the collaborations, indicating that the human-human collaborations are significantly more fluent, and analysis of the IMU data indicates that it captures objective differences in the motion profiles of the conditions. The differences in objective and subjective measures of accuracy and fluency between the human-human and human-robot trials motivate future research into improving robot assistants for physical tasks by enabling them to send and receive anthropomorphic haptic signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 18 figures, ROMAN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fine-Tuning Robot Policies While Maintaining User Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18311v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works introduce general-purpose robot policies. These policies provide a strong prior over how robots should behave -- e.g., how a robot arm should manipulate food items. But in order for robots to match an individual person's needs, users typically fine-tune these generalized policies -- e.g., showing the robot arm how to make their own preferred dinners. Importantly, during the process of personalizing robots, end-users leak data about their preferences, habits, and styles (e.g., the foods they prefer to eat). Other agents can simply roll-out the fine-tuned policy and see these personally-trained behaviors. This leads to a fundamental challenge: how can we develop robots that personalize actions while keeping learning private from external agents? We here explore this emerging topic in human-robot interaction and develop PRoP, a model-agnostic framework for personalized and private robot policies. Our core idea is to equip each user with a unique key; this key is then used to mathematically transform the weights of the robot's network. With the correct key, the robot's policy switches to match that user's preferences -- but with incorrect keys, the robot reverts to its baseline behaviors. We show the general applicability of our method across multiple model types in imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and classification tasks. PRoP is practically advantageous because it retains the architecture and behaviors of the original policy, and experimentally outperforms existing encoder-based approaches.

| **[PEEK: Guiding and Minimal Image Representations for Zero-Shot Generalization of Robot Manipulation Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18282v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation policies often fail to generalize because they must simultaneously learn where to attend, what actions to take, and how to execute them. We argue that high-level reasoning about where and what can be offloaded to vision-language models (VLMs), leaving policies to specialize in how to act. We present PEEK (Policy-agnostic Extraction of Essential Keypoints), which fine-tunes VLMs to predict a unified point-based intermediate representation: 1. end-effector paths specifying what actions to take, and 2. task-relevant masks indicating where to focus. These annotations are directly overlaid onto robot observations, making the representation policy-agnostic and transferable across architectures. To enable scalable training, we introduce an automatic annotation pipeline, generating labeled data across 20+ robot datasets spanning 9 embodiments. In real-world evaluations, PEEK consistently boosts zero-shot generalization, including a 41.4x real-world improvement for a 3D policy trained only in simulation, and 2-3.5x gains for both large VLAs and small manipulation policies. By letting VLMs absorb semantic and visual complexity, PEEK equips manipulation policies with the minimal cues they need--where, what, and how.

ByteWrist addresses the critical limitations of existing serial and parallel wrists in narrow-space operations through a compact three-stage parallel drive mechanism integrated with arc-shaped end linkages. The design achieves precise RPY (Roll-Pitch-Yaw) motion while maintaining exceptional compactness, making it particularly suitable for complex unstructured environments such as home services, medical assistance, and precision assembly. The key innovations include: (1) a nested three-stage motor-driven linkages that minimize volume while enabling independent multi-DOF control, (2) arc-shaped end linkages that optimize force transmission and expand motion range, and (3) a central supporting ball functioning as a spherical joint that enhances structural stiffness without compromising flexibility. Meanwhile, we present comprehensive kinematic modeling including forward / inverse kinematics and a numerical Jacobian solution for precise control. Empirically, we observe ByteWrist demonstrates strong performance in narrow-space maneuverability and dual-arm cooperative manipulation tasks, outperforming Kinova-based systems. Results indicate significant improvements in compactness, efficiency, and stiffness compared to traditional designs, establishing ByteWrist as a promising solution for next-generation robotic manipulation in constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech Report.13 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Look, Focus, Act: Efficient and Robust Robot Learning via Human Gaze and Foveated Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15833v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs attention to task-relevant regions through foveation, dramatically reducing visual processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance efficiency and robustness. We develop GIAVA (Gaze Integrated Active-Vision ALOHA), a robot vision system that emulates human head and neck movement, and gaze adjustment for foveated processing. Extending the AV-ALOHA robot platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking, perspective control, and robot manipulation demonstration data from a human operator. We also open-source a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Inspired by recent work in foveated image segmentation and given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens, and thus computation. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision drastically reduces computational overhead, and enhances robustness to background distractors. Notably, on certain high-precision tasks, foveated vision also improves performance, as reflected in higher success rates. Together, these findings suggest that human-inspired foveated visual processing offers untapped potential and should be further considered as a useful inductive bias in robotic vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> |
| **[M3ET: Efficient Vision-Language Learning for Robotics based on Multimodal Mamba-Enhanced Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18005v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, multimodal learning has become essential in robotic vision and information fusion, especially for understanding human behavior in complex environments. However, current methods struggle to fully leverage the textual modality, relying on supervised pretrained models, which limits semantic extraction in unsupervised robotic environments, particularly with significant modality loss. These methods also tend to be computationally intensive, leading to high resource consumption in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi Modal Mamba Enhanced Transformer (M3ET), a lightweight model designed for efficient multimodal learning, particularly on mobile platforms. By incorporating the Mamba module and a semantic-based adaptive attention mechanism, M3ET optimizes feature fusion, alignment, and modality reconstruction. Our experiments show that M3ET improves cross-task performance, with a 2.3 times increase in pretraining inference speed. In particular, the core VQA task accuracy of M3ET remains at 0.74, while the model's parameter count is reduced by 0.67. Although performance on the EQA task is limited, M3ET's lightweight design makes it well suited for deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Vector Field-Guided Learning Predictive Control for Motion Planning of Mobile Robots with Uncertain Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08283v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In obstacle-dense scenarios, providing safe guidance for mobile robots is critical to improve the safe maneuvering capability. However, the guidance provided by standard guiding vector fields (GVFs) may limit the motion capability due to the improper curvature of the integral curve when traversing obstacles. On the other hand, robotic system dynamics are often time-varying, uncertain, and even unknown during the motion planning process. Therefore, many existing kinodynamic motion planning methods could not achieve satisfactory reliability in guaranteeing safety. To address these challenges, we propose a two-level Vector Field-guided Learning Predictive Control (VF-LPC) approach that improves safe maneuverability. The first level, the guiding level, generates safe desired trajectories using the designed kinodynamic GVF, enabling safe motion in obstacle-dense environments. The second level, the Integrated Motion Planning and Control (IMPC) level, first uses a deep Koopman operator to learn a nominal dynamics model offline and then updates the model uncertainties online using sparse Gaussian processes (GPs). The learned dynamics and a game-based safe barrier function are then incorporated into the LPC framework to generate near-optimal planning solutions. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments were conducted on quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles, demonstrating that VF-LPC enables robots to maneuver safely.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, inspection has often been reduced to navigation tasks, where the objective is to reach a predefined location while avoiding obstacles. However, this formulation captures only part of the real inspection problem. In real-world environments, the inspection targets may become visible well before their exact coordinates are reached, making further movement both redundant and inefficient. What matters more for inspection is not simply arriving at the target's position, but positioning the robot at a viewpoint from which the target becomes observable. In this work, we revisit inspection from a perception-aware perspective. We propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that explicitly incorporates target visibility as the primary objective, enabling the robot to find the shortest trajectory that guarantees visual contact with the target without relying on a map. The learned policy leverages both perceptual and proprioceptive sensing and is trained entirely in simulation, before being deployed to a real-world robot. We further develop an algorithm to compute ground-truth shortest inspection paths, which provides a reference for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method outperforms existing classical and learning-based navigation approaches, yielding more efficient inspection trajectories in both simulated and real-world settings.

We present the Enhanced NAO, a revitalized version of Aldebaran's NAO robot that uses upgraded microphones, RGB-D and thermal cameras, and additional compute resources in a fully self-contained package. This system combines cloud and local models for perception and dialogue, while preserving the NAO's expressive body and behaviors. In a pilot validation study, the Enhanced NAO delivered significantly higher conversational quality and stronger user preference compared to the NAO AI Edition, without increasing response latency. Key upgrades, such as beamforming microphones and low-latency audio processing, reduced artifacts like self-hearing and improved multi-party separation. Expanded visual and thermal sensing established a foundation for future interaction capabilities. Beyond the NAO, our framework provides a platform-agnostic strategy for extending the lifespan and research utility of legacy robots, ensuring they remain valuable tools for human-robot interaction.</p></details> |  |

While other aspects of robotic manipulation such as image or language understanding may be learned from internet-based datasets, acquiring motion knowledge remains challenging. Human data, with its rich diversity of manipulation behaviors, offers a valuable resource for this purpose. While previous works show that using human data can bring benefits, such as improving robustness and training efficiency, it remains unclear whether it can realize its greatest advantage: enabling robot policies to directly learn new motions for task completion. In this paper, we systematically explore this potential through multi-task human-robot cotraining. We introduce MotionTrans, a framework that includes a data collection system, a human data transformation pipeline, and a weighted cotraining strategy. By cotraining 30 human-robot tasks simultaneously, we direcly transfer motions of 13 tasks from human data to deployable end-to-end robot policies. Notably, 9 tasks achieve non-trivial success rates in zero-shot manner. MotionTrans also significantly enhances pretraining-finetuning performance (+40% success rate). Through ablation study, we also identify key factors for successful motion learning: cotraining with robot data and broad task-related motion coverage.

| **[I-FailSense: Towards General Robotic Failure Detection with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16072v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-conditioned robotic manipulation in open-world settings requires not only accurate task execution but also the ability to detect failures for robust deployment in real-world environments. Although recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved the spatial reasoning and task-planning capabilities of robots, they remain limited in their ability to recognize their own failures. In particular, a critical yet underexplored challenge lies in detecting semantic misalignment errors, where the robot executes a task that is semantically meaningful but inconsistent with the given instruction. To address this, we propose a method for building datasets targeting Semantic Misalignment Failures detection, from existing language-conditioned manipulation datasets. We also present I-FailSense, an open-source VLM framework with grounded arbitration designed specifically for failure detection. Our approach relies on post-training a base VLM, followed by training lightweight classification heads, called FS blocks, attached to different internal layers of the VLM and whose predictions are aggregated using an ensembling mechanism. Experiments show that I-FailSense outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs, both comparable in size and larger, in detecting semantic misalignment errors. Notably, despite being trained only on semantic misalignment detection, I-FailSense generalizes to broader robotic failure categories and effectively transfers to other simulation environments and real-world with zero-shot or minimal post-training. The datasets and models are publicly released on HuggingFace (Webpage: https://clemgris.github.io/I-FailSense/).</p></details> |  |

We present a novel approach for robust and resilient object insertion using a passively compliant soft wrist that enables safe contact absorption through large deformations, without high-frequency control or force sensing. Our method structures insertion as compliance-enabled contact formations, sequential contact states that progressively constrain degrees of freedom, and integrates automated failure recovery strategies. Our key insight is that wrist compliance permits safe, repeated recovery attempts; hence, we refer to it as compliance-enabled failure recovery. We employ a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) that assesses each skill execution from terminal poses and images, identifies failure modes, and proposes recovery actions by selecting skills and updating goals. In simulation, our method achieved an 83% success rate, recovering from failures induced by randomized conditions--including grasp misalignments up to 5 degrees, hole-pose errors up to 20mm, fivefold increases in friction, and previously unseen square/rectangular pegs--and we further validate the approach on a real robot.</p></details> |  |

Such methods often fail to scale, as every new problem or application requires time-consuming and iterative reward definition and tuning. We present Generalist Contact-Conditioned Policy (GeCCo) -- a low-level policy trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning that is capable of tracking arbitrary contact points on a quadruped robot. The strength of our approach is that it provides a general and modular low-level controller that can be reused for a wider range of high-level tasks, without the need to re-train new controllers from scratch. We demonstrate the scalability and robustness of our method by evaluating on a wide range of locomotion and manipulation tasks in a common framework and under a single generalist policy. These include a variety of gaits, traversing complex terrains (eg. stairs and slopes) as well as previously unseen stepping-stones and narrow beams, and interacting with objects (eg. pushing buttons, tracking trajectories). Our framework acquires new behaviors more efficiently, simply by combining a task-specific high-level contact planner and the pre-trained generalist policy.

Training robotic manipulation policies on these datasets is traditionally performed in a centralized manner, raising concerns regarding scalability, adaptability, and data privacy. While federated learning enables decentralized, privacy-preserving training, its application to robotic manipulation remains largely unexplored. We introduce FLAME (Federated Learning Across Manipulation Environments), the first benchmark designed for federated learning in robotic manipulation. FLAME consists of: (i) a set of large-scale datasets of over 160,000 expert demonstrations of multiple manipulation tasks, collected across a wide range of simulated environments; (ii) a training and evaluation framework for robotic policy learning in a federated setting. We evaluate standard federated learning algorithms in FLAME, showing their potential for distributed policy learning and highlighting key challenges. Our benchmark establishes a foundation for scalable, adaptive, and privacy-aware robotic learning.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Dexterous Grasping with Real-World Robotic Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04014v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous grasping in the real world presents a fundamental and significant challenge for robot learning. The ability to employ affordance-aware poses to grasp objects with diverse geometries and properties in arbitrary scenarios is essential for general-purpose robots. However, existing research predominantly addresses dexterous grasping problems within simulators, which encounter difficulties when applied in real-world environments due to the domain gap between reality and simulation. This limitation hinders their generalizability and practicality in real-world applications. In this paper, we present DexGraspRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly trains robots in real-world environments to acquire dexterous grasping skills. Specifically, DexGraspRL consists of two stages: (i) a pretraining stage that pretrains the policy using imitation learning (IL) with a limited set of expert demonstrations; (ii) a fine-tuning stage that refines the policy through direct RL in real-world scenarios. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon arising from the distribution shift between demonstrations and real-world environments, we design a regularization term that balances the exploitation of RL with the preservation of the pretrained policy. Our experiments with real-world tasks demonstrate that DexGraspRL successfully accomplishes diverse dexterous grasping tasks, achieving an average success rate of nearly 92%. Furthermore, by fine-tuning with RL, our method uncovers novel policies, surpassing the IL policy with a 23% reduction in average cycle time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Trajectory Planner with a Reinforcement Learning-based Controller for Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17381v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating obstacle-free trajectories for robotic manipulators in unstructured and cluttered environments remains a significant challenge. Existing motion planning methods often require additional computational effort to generate the final trajectory by solving kinematic or dynamic equations. This paper highlights the strong potential of model-free reinforcement learning methods over model-based approaches for obstacle-free trajectory planning in joint space. We propose a fast trajectory planning system for manipulators that combines vision-based path planning in task space with reinforcement learning-based obstacle avoidance in joint space. We divide the framework into two key components. The first introduces an innovative vision-based trajectory planner in task space, leveraging the large-scale fast segment anything (FSA) model in conjunction with basis spline (B-spline)-optimized kinodynamic path searching. The second component enhances the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm by integrating action ensembles (AE) and policy feedback (PF), which greatly improve precision and stability in goal-reaching and obstacle avoidance within the joint space. These PPO enhancements increase the algorithm's adaptability across diverse robotic tasks, ensuring consistent execution of commands from the first component by the manipulator, while also enhancing both obstacle avoidance efficiency and reaching accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PPO enhancements, as well as simulation-to-simulation (Sim-to-Sim) and simulation-to-reality (Sim-to-Real) transfer, in improving model robustness and planner efficiency in complex scenarios. These enhancements allow the robot to perform obstacle avoidance and real-time trajectory planning in obstructed environments.

| **[The Sound of Simulation: Learning Multimodal Sim-to-Real Robot Policies with Generative Audio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02864v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the multimodal sim-to-real gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Robot Learning 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Scalable Multi-Robot Framework for Decentralized and Asynchronous Perception-Action-Communication Loops](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10164v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaboration in large robot swarms to achieve a common global objective is a challenging problem in large environments due to limited sensing and communication capabilities. The robots must execute a Perception-Action-Communication (PAC) loop -- they perceive their local environment, communicate with other robots, and take actions in real time. A fundamental challenge in decentralized PAC systems is to decide what information to communicate with the neighboring robots and how to take actions while utilizing the information shared by the neighbors. Recently, this has been addressed using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for applications such as flocking and coverage control. Although conceptually, GNN policies are fully decentralized, the evaluation and deployment of such policies have primarily remained centralized or restrictively decentralized. Furthermore, existing frameworks assume sequential execution of perception and action inference, which is very restrictive in real-world applications. This paper proposes a framework for asynchronous PAC in robot swarms, where decentralized GNNs are used to compute navigation actions and generate messages for communication. In particular, we use aggregated GNNs, which enable the exchange of hidden layer information between robots for computational efficiency and decentralized inference of actions. Furthermore, the modules in the framework are asynchronous, allowing robots to perform sensing, extracting information, communication, action inference, and control execution at different frequencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNs executed in the proposed framework in navigating large robot swarms for collaborative coverage of large environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Imagine2Act: Leveraging Object-Action Motion Consistency from Imagined Goals for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17125v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational object rearrangement (ROR) tasks (e.g., insert flower to vase) require a robot to manipulate objects with precise semantic and geometric reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on pre-collected demonstrations that struggle to capture complex geometric constraints or generate goal-state observations to capture semantic and geometric knowledge, but fail to explicitly couple object transformation with action prediction, resulting in errors due to generative noise. To address these limitations, we propose Imagine2Act, a 3D imitation-learning framework that incorporates semantic and geometric constraints of objects into policy learning to tackle high-precision manipulation tasks. We first generate imagined goal images conditioned on language instructions and reconstruct corresponding 3D point clouds to provide robust semantic and geometric priors. These imagined goal point clouds serve as additional inputs to the policy model, while an object-action consistency strategy with soft pose supervision explicitly aligns predicted end-effector motion with generated object transformation. This design enables Imagine2Act to reason about semantic and geometric relationships between objects and predict accurate actions across diverse tasks. Experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that Imagine2Act outperforms previous state-of-the-art policies.

| **[IDfRA: Self-Verification for Iterative Design in Robotic Assembly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16998v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robots proliferate in manufacturing, Design for Robotic Assembly (DfRA), which is designing products for efficient automated assembly, is increasingly important. Traditional approaches to DfRA rely on manual planning, which is time-consuming, expensive and potentially impractical for complex objects. Large language models (LLM) have exhibited proficiency in semantic interpretation and robotic task planning, stimulating interest in their application to the automation of DfRA. But existing methodologies typically rely on heuristic strategies and rigid, hard-coded physics simulators that may not translate into real-world assembly contexts. In this work, we present Iterative Design for Robotic Assembly (IDfRA), a framework using iterative cycles of planning, execution, verification, and re-planning, each informed by self-assessment, to progressively enhance design quality within a fixed yet initially under-specified environment, thereby eliminating the physics simulation with the real world itself. The framework accepts as input a target structure together with a partial environmental representation. Through successive refinement, it converges toward solutions that reconcile semantic fidelity with physical feasibility. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that IDfRA attains 73.3\% top-1 accuracy in semantic recognisability, surpassing the baseline on this metric. Moreover, the resulting assembly plans exhibit robust physical feasibility, achieving an overall 86.9\% construction success rate, with design quality improving across iterations, albeit not always monotonically. Pairwise human evaluation further corroborates the advantages of IDfRA relative to alternative approaches. By integrating self-verification with context-aware adaptation, the framework evidences strong potential for deployment in unstructured manufacturing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reliable Robot Motion Planner in Complex Real-world Environments via Action Imagination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16963v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans and animals can make real-time adjustments to movements by imagining their action outcomes to prevent unanticipated or even catastrophic motion failures in unknown unstructured environments. Action imagination, as a refined sensorimotor strategy, leverages perception-action loops to handle physical interaction-induced uncertainties in perception and system modeling within complex systems. Inspired by the action-awareness capability of animal intelligence, this study proposes an imagination-inspired motion planner (I-MP) framework that specifically enhances robots' action reliability by imagining plausible spatial states for approaching. After topologizing the workspace, I-MP build perception-action loop enabling robots autonomously build contact models. Leveraging fixed-point theory and Hausdorff distance, the planner computes convergent spatial states under interaction characteristics and mission constraints. By homogenously representing multi-dimensional environmental characteristics through work, the robot can approach the imagined spatial states via real-time computation of energy gradients. Consequently, experimental results demonstrate the practicality and robustness of I-MP in complex cluttered environments.</p></details> |  |

To solve this, we present SwarmChat, a context-aware, multimodal interaction system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). SwarmChat enables users to issue natural language commands to robotic swarms using multiple modalities, such as text, voice, or teleoperation. The system integrates four LLM-based modules: Context Generator, Intent Recognition, Task Planner, and Modality Selector. These modules collaboratively generate context from keywords, detect user intent, adapt commands based on real-time robot state, and suggest optimal communication modalities. Its three-layer architecture offers a dynamic interface with both fixed and customizable command options, supporting flexible control while optimizing cognitive effort. The preliminary evaluation also shows that the SwarmChat's LLM modules provide accurate context interpretation, relevant intent recognition, and effective command delivery, achieving high user satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted and presented at the 16th International Conference on Swarm Intelligence (ICSI 2025), held on July 11-15, 2025, in Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |

However, current methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address challenges in olfactory navigation, we introduce a multimodal olfaction dataset along with a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines. This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and training methods, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors, enabling them to detect more compounds and inform better hardware design. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound in critical applications such as explosives detection, narcotics screening, and search and rescue. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

However, developing such capabilities through online reinforcement learning is sometimes impractical due to the prohibitive cost of data collection and the risk of generating unsafe behaviors. In this paper, we study the use of offline reinforcement learning as a practical and efficient alternative. This technique uses pre-collected data to enable emotion-adaptive social robots. We present a system architecture that integrates multimodal sensing and recognition, decision-making, and adaptive responses. Using a limited dataset from a human-robot game-playing scenario, we establish a benchmark for comparing offline reinforcement learning algorithms that do not require an online environment. Our results show that BCQ and CQL are more robust to data sparsity, achieving higher state-action values compared to NFQ, DQN, and DDQN. This work establishes a foundation for benchmarking offline RL in emotion-adaptive robotics and informs future deployment in real-world HRI.

We can further break down the problem into (1) data sparsity from the angle of data representation and (2) data scarcity from the angle of data quantity. In this thesis, I will discuss selected works on two domains: (1) tactile sensing and (2) rehabilitation robots, which are exemplars of data sparsity and scarcity, respectively. Tactile sensing is an essential modality for robotics, but tactile data are often sparse, and for each interaction with the physical world, tactile sensors can only obtain information about the local area of contact. I will discuss my work on learning vision-free tactile-only exploration and manipulation policies through model-free reinforcement learning to make efficient use of sparse tactile information. On the other hand, rehabilitation robots are an example of data scarcity to the extreme due to the significant challenge of collecting biosignals from disabled-bodied subjects at scale for training. I will discuss my work in collaboration with the medical school and clinicians on intent inferral for stroke survivors, where a hand orthosis developed in our lab collects a set of biosignals from the patient and uses them to infer the activity that the patient intends to perform, so the orthosis can provide the right type of physical assistance at the right moment. My work develops machine learning algorithms that enable intent inferral with minimal data, including semi-supervised, meta-learning, and generative AI methods.</p></details> |  |

To achieve that, HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars, robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of TRUST 2025 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11402), a workshop at IEEE RO-MAN 2025: https://ro-man2025.org/</p></details> |

Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided more promising solutions for this task. However, current methods struggle to establish complex dependencies between text and visual details, and have difficulty perceiving the spatial information of surgical scenes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, Surgical-MambaLLM, which is the first to combine Mamba2 with LLM in the surgical domain, that leverages Mamba2's ability to effectively capture cross-modal dependencies and perceive spatial information in surgical scenes, thereby enhancing the LLMs' understanding of surgical images. Specifically, we propose the Cross-modal Bidirectional Mamba2 Integration (CBMI) module to leverage Mamba2 for effective multimodal fusion, with its cross-modal integration capabilities. Additionally, tailored to the geometric characteristics of surgical scenes, we design the Surgical Instrument Perception (SIP) scanning mode for Mamba2 to scan the surgical images, enhancing the model's spatial understanding of the surgical scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Surgical-MambaLLM model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the EndoVis17-VQLA and EndoVis18-VQLA datasets, significantly improving the performance of the Surgical-VQLA task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early accepted by MICCAI2025</p></details> |

However, traditional approaches often rely on programming tailored to each product by experts for fixed settings, which are inherently inflexible to product changes and lack the robustness to handle variations. As Behavior Trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robotics for their modularity and reactivity, we propose a novel hierarchical framework, Video-to-BT, that seamlessly integrates high-level cognitive planning with low-level reactive control, with BTs serving both as the structured output of planning and as the governing structure for execution. Our approach leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to decompose human demonstration videos into subtasks, from which Behavior Trees are generated. During the execution, the planned BTs combined with real-time scene interpretation enable the system to operate reactively in the dynamic environment, while VLM-driven replanning is triggered upon execution failure. This closed-loop architecture ensures stability and adaptivity. We validate our framework on real-world assembly tasks through a series of experiments, demonstrating high planning reliability, robust performance in long-horizon assembly tasks, and strong generalization across diverse and perturbed conditions.

| **[TranTac: Leveraging Transient Tactile Signals for Contact-Rich Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16550v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation tasks such as inserting a key into a lock or plugging a USB device into a port can fail when visual perception is insufficient to detect misalignment. In these situations, touch sensing is crucial for the robot to monitor the task's states and make precise, timely adjustments. Current touch sensing solutions are either insensitive to detect subtle changes or demand excessive sensor data. Here, we introduce TranTac, a data-efficient and low-cost tactile sensing and control framework that integrates a single contact-sensitive 6-axis inertial measurement unit within the elastomeric tips of a robotic gripper for completing fine insertion tasks. Our customized sensing system can detect dynamic translational and torsional deformations at the micrometer scale, enabling the tracking of visually imperceptible pose changes of the grasped object. By leveraging transformer-based encoders and diffusion policy, TranTac can imitate human insertion behaviors using transient tactile cues detected at the gripper's tip during insertion processes. These cues enable the robot to dynamically control and correct the 6-DoF pose of the grasped object. When combined with vision, TranTac achieves an average success rate of 79% on object grasping and insertion tasks, outperforming both vision-only policy and the one augmented with end-effector 6D force/torque sensing. Contact localization performance is also validated through tactile-only misaligned insertion tasks, achieving an average success rate of 88%. We assess the generalizability by training TranTac on a single prism-slot pair and testing it on unseen data, including a USB plug and a metal key, and find that the insertion tasks can still be completed with an average success rate of nearly 70%. The proposed framework may inspire new robotic tactile sensing systems for delicate manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Therapists can create custom trails for each patient and the patient can trace the trails using a robotic device. The platform can track the performance of the patient and use these data to provide dynamic assistance through the robot to the patient interface. Therefore, the proposed platform not only functions as an evaluation platform, but also trains the patient in recovery. The developed platform has been validated at a rehabilitation center, with therapists and patients operating the device. It was found that patients performed poorly while using the platform compared to healthy subjects and that the assistance provided also improved performance amongst patients.

However, 3D point cloud-based approaches face the significant challenge of high data acquisition costs, limiting their scalability and real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework NoReal3D: which introduces the 3DStructureFormer, a learnable 3D perception module capable of transforming monocular images into geometrically meaningful pseudo-point cloud features, effectively fused with the 2D encoder output features. Specially, the generated pseudo-point clouds retain geometric and topological structures so we design a pseudo-point cloud encoder to preserve these properties, making it well-suited for our framework. We also investigate the effectiveness of different feature fusion strategies.Our framework enhances the robot's understanding of 3D spatial structures while completely eliminating the substantial costs associated with 3D point cloud acquisition.Extensive experiments across various tasks validate that our framework can achieve performance comparable to 3D point cloud-based methods, without the actual point cloud data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20840v2)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Substrate-Timing-Independence for Meta-State Stability of Distributed Robotic Swarms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16492v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergent properties in distributed systems arise due to timing unpredictability; asynchronous state evolution within each sub-system may lead the macro-system to faulty meta-states. Empirical validation of correctness is often prohibitively expensive, as the size of the state-space is too large to be tractable. In robotic swarms this problem is exacerbated, when compared to software systems, by the variability of the implementation substrate across the design, or even the deployment, process. We present an approach for formally reasoning about the correctness of robotic swarm design in a substrate-timing-independent way. By leveraging concurrent process calculi (namely, Communicating Sequential Processes), we introduce a methodology that can automatically identify possible causes of faulty meta-states and correct such designs such that meta-states are consistently stable, even in the presence of timing variability due to substrate changes. We evaluate this approach on a robotic swarm with a clearly identified fault, realized in both simulation and reality. Results support the research hypothesis, showing that the swarm reaches an illegal meta-state before the correction is applied, but behaves consistently correctly after the correction. Our techniques are transferable across different design methodologies, contributing to the toolbox of formal methods for roboticists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Conga: A Leader-Follower Walking Approach to Sequential Path Following in Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16482v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated path following in multi-agent systems is a key challenge in robotics, with applications in automated logistics, surveillance, and collaborative exploration. Traditional formation control techniques often rely on time-parameterized trajectories and path integrals, which can result in synchronization issues and rigid behavior. In this work, we address the problem of sequential path following, where agents maintain fixed spatial separation along a common trajectory, guided by a leader under centralized control. We introduce Robot Conga, a leader-follower control strategy that updates each agent's desired state based on the leader's spatial displacement rather than time, assuming access to a global position reference, an assumption valid in indoor environments equipped with motion capture, vision-based tracking, or UWB localization systems. The algorithm was validated in simulation using both TurtleBot3 and quadruped (Laikago) robots. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, stable inter-agent spacing, and fast convergence, with all agents aligning within 250 time steps (approx. 0.25 seconds) in the quadruped case, and almost instantaneously in the TurtleBot3 implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 8 Figures.

Key factors such as mechanical compliance and motor mass distribution have driven the adoption of parallel mechanism architectures. However, selecting the optimal configuration depends on both actuator availability and task requirements. We propose a unified methodology for the design and evaluation of parallel ankle mechanisms. A multi-objective optimization synthesizes the mechanism geometry, the resulting solutions are evaluated using a scalar cost function that aggregates key performance metrics for cross-architecture comparison. We focus on two representative architectures: the Spherical-Prismatic-Universal (SPU) and the Revolute-Spherical-Universal (RSU). For both, we resolve the kinematics, and for the RSU, introduce a parameterization that ensures workspace feasibility and accelerates optimization. We validate our approach by redesigning the ankle of an existing humanoid robot. The optimized RSU consistently outperforms both the original serial design and a conventionally engineered RSU, reducing the cost function by up to 41% and 14%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 2025 IEEE-RAS 24th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids), Seoul, 2025</p></details> |

RL performance can improve by leveraging prior knowledge, even when demonstrations are limited and collected from simplified environments. To address this, we define General Abstract Symmetry (GAS) for aggregating demonstrations from symmetrical abstract partitions of the robot environment. We introduce Demo-EASE, a novel training framework using a dual-buffer architecture that stores both demonstrations and RL-generated experiences. Demo-EASE improves sample efficiency through symmetry-guided demonstrations and behavior cloning, enabling strong initialization and balanced exploration-exploitation. Demo-EASE is compatible with both on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms, supporting various training regimes. We evaluate our framework in three simulation experiments using a Kinova Gen3 robot with joint-space control within PyBullet. Our results show that Demo-EASE significantly accelerates convergence and improves final performance compared to standard RL baselines, demonstrating its potential for efficient real-world robotic manipulation learning.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we advance video-based recognition of indoor daily actions for robotic perception by leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) enriched with domain-specific knowledge. We adapt a prompt-learning framework in which class-level textual descriptions of each action are embedded as learnable prompts into a frozen pre-trained VLM backbone. Several strategies for structuring and encoding these textual descriptions are designed and evaluated. Experiments on the ETRI-Activity3D dataset demonstrate that our method, using only RGB video inputs at test time, achieves over 95\% accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of knowledge-augmented prompts in enabling robust action recognition with minimal supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Modular Robotic System for Autonomous Exploration and Semantic Updating in Large-Scale Indoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15493v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a modular robotic system for autonomous exploration and semantic updating of large-scale unknown environments. Our approach enables a mobile robot to build, revisit, and update a hybrid semantic map that integrates a 2D occupancy grid for geometry with a topological graph for object semantics. Unlike prior methods that rely on manual teleoperation or precollected datasets, our two-phase approach achieves end-to-end autonomy: first, a modified frontier-based exploration algorithm with dynamic search windows constructs a geometric map; second, using a greedy trajectory planner, environments are revisited, and object semantics are updated using open-vocabulary object detection and segmentation. This modular system, compatible with any metric SLAM framework, supports continuous operation by efficiently updating the semantic graph to reflect short-term and long-term changes such as object relocation, removal, or addition. We validate the approach on a Fetch robot in real-world indoor environments of approximately $8,500$m$^2$ and $117$m$^2$, demonstrating robust and scalable semantic mapping and continuous adaptation, marking a fully autonomous integration of exploration, mapping, and semantic updating on a physical robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Subteaming and Adaptive Formation Control for Coordinated Multi-Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16412v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-robot navigation is essential for robots to operate as a team in diverse environments. During navigation, robot teams usually need to maintain specific formations, such as circular formations to protect human teammates at the center. However, in complex scenarios such as narrow corridors, rigidly preserving predefined formations can become infeasible. Therefore, robot teams must be capable of dynamically splitting into smaller subteams and adaptively controlling the subteams to navigate through such scenarios while preserving formations. To enable this capability, we introduce a novel method for SubTeaming and Adaptive Formation (STAF), which is built upon a unified hierarchical learning framework: (1) high-level deep graph cut for team splitting, (2) intermediate-level graph learning for facilitating coordinated navigation among subteams, and (3) low-level policy learning for controlling individual mobile robots to reach their goal positions while avoiding collisions. To evaluate STAF, we conducted extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments using robotics simulations and physical robot teams. Experimental results show that STAF enables the novel capability for subteaming and adaptive formation control, and achieves promising performance in coordinated multi-robot navigation through challenging scenarios.

Standard reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning methods require expert supervision through human-designed reward functions or demonstrations for every new task. In contrast, ReWiND starts from a small demonstration dataset to learn: (1) a data-efficient, language-conditioned reward function that labels the dataset with rewards, and (2) a language-conditioned policy pre-trained with offline RL using these rewards. Given an unseen task variation, ReWiND fine-tunes the pre-trained policy using the learned reward function, requiring minimal online interaction. We show that ReWiND's reward model generalizes effectively to unseen tasks, outperforming baselines by up to 2.4x in reward generalization and policy alignment metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that ReWiND enables sample-efficient adaptation to new tasks, beating baselines by 2x in simulation and improving real-world pretrained bimanual policies by 5x, taking a step towards scalable, real-world robot learning.

| **[Tactile-Based Human Intent Recognition for Robot Assistive Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16353v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot assistive navigation (RAN) is critical for enhancing the mobility and independence of the growing population of mobility-impaired individuals. However, existing systems often rely on interfaces that fail to replicate the intuitive and efficient physical communication observed between a person and a human caregiver, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce Tac-Nav, a RAN system that leverages a cylindrical tactile skin mounted on a Stretch 3 mobile manipulator to provide a more natural and efficient interface for human navigational intent recognition. To robustly classify the tactile data, we developed the Cylindrical Kernel Support Vector Machine (CK-SVM), an algorithm that explicitly models the sensor's cylindrical geometry and is consequently robust to the natural rotational shifts present in a user's grasp. Comprehensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our classification algorithm and the overall system. Results show that CK-SVM achieved superior classification accuracy on both simulated (97.1%) and real-world (90.8%) datasets compared to four baseline models. Furthermore, a pilot study confirmed that users more preferred the Tac-Nav tactile interface over conventional joystick and voice-based controls.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Natural Language for Human-Robot Collaboration in the Real World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11759v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have a vision of a day when autonomous robots can collaborate with humans as assistants in performing complex tasks in the physical world. This vision includes that the robots will have the ability to communicate with their human collaborators using language that is natural to the humans. Traditional Interactive Task Learning (ITL) systems have some of this ability, but the language they can understand is very limited. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides an opportunity to greatly improve the language understanding of robots, yet integrating the language abilities of LLMs with robots that operate in the real physical world is a challenging problem. In this chapter we first review briefly a few commercial robot products that work closely with humans, and discuss how they could be much better collaborators with robust language abilities. We then explore how an AI system with a cognitive agent that controls a physical robot at its core, interacts with both a human and an LLM, and accumulates situational knowledge through its experiences, can be a possible approach to reach that vision. We focus on three specific challenges of having the robot understand natural language, and present a simple proof-of-concept experiment using ChatGPT for each. Finally, we discuss what it will take to turn these simple experiments into an operational system where LLM-assisted language understanding is a part of an integrated robotic assistant that uses language to collaborate with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Efficient Detection of Objects Near a Robot Manipulator via Miniature Time-of-Flight Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16122v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide a method for detecting and localizing objects near a robot arm using arm-mounted miniature time-of-flight sensors. A key challenge when using arm-mounted sensors is differentiating between the robot itself and external objects in sensor measurements. To address this challenge, we propose a computationally lightweight method which utilizes the raw time-of-flight information captured by many off-the-shelf, low-resolution time-of-flight sensor. We build an empirical model of expected sensor measurements in the presence of the robot alone, and use this model at runtime to detect objects in proximity to the robot. In addition to avoiding robot self-detections in common sensor configurations, the proposed method enables extra flexibility in sensor placement, unlocking configurations which achieve more efficient coverage of a radius around the robot arm. Our method can detect small objects near the arm and localize the position of objects along the length of a robot link to reasonable precision. We evaluate the performance of the method with respect to object type, location, and ambient light level, and identify limiting factors on performance inherent in the measurement principle. The proposed method has potential applications in collision avoidance and in facilitating safe human-robot interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Matter of Height: The Impact of a Robotic Object on Human Compliance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16032v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots come in various forms and have different characteristics that may shape the interaction with them. In human-human interactions, height is a characteristic that shapes human dynamics, with taller people typically perceived as more persuasive. In this work, we aspired to evaluate if the same impact replicates in a human-robot interaction and specifically with a highly non-humanoid robotic object. The robot was designed with modules that could be easily added or removed, allowing us to change its height without altering other design features. To test the impact of the robot's height, we evaluated participants' compliance with its request to volunteer to perform a tedious task. In the experiment, participants performed a cognitive task on a computer, which was framed as the main experiment. When done, they were informed that the experiment was completed. While waiting to receive their credits, the robotic object, designed as a mobile robotic service table, entered the room, carrying a tablet that invited participants to complete a 300-question questionnaire voluntarily. We compared participants' compliance in two conditions: A Short robot composed of two modules and 95cm in height and a Tall robot consisting of three modules and 132cm in height. Our findings revealed higher compliance with the Short robot's request, demonstrating an opposite pattern to human dynamics. We conclude that while height has a substantial social impact on human-robot interactions, it follows a unique pattern of influence. Our findings suggest that designers cannot simply adopt and implement elements from human social dynamics to robots without testing them first.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, submitted to IEEE RO-MAN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Defining and Monitoring Complex Robot Activities via LLMs and Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16006v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in automating labor-intensive and complex activities, i.e., those consisting of multiple atomic tasks, by deploying robots in dynamic and unpredictable environments such as industrial and agricultural settings. A key characteristic of these contexts is that activities are not predefined: while they involve a limited set of possible tasks, their combinations may vary depending on the situation. Moreover, despite recent advances in robotics, the ability for humans to monitor the progress of high-level activities - in terms of past, present, and future actions - remains fundamental to ensure the correct execution of safety-critical processes. In this paper, we introduce a general architecture that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with automated planning, enabling humans to specify high-level activities (also referred to as processes) using natural language, and to monitor their execution by querying a robot. We also present an implementation of this architecture using state-of-the-art components and quantitatively evaluate the approach in a real-world precision agriculture scenario.</p></details> |  |
| **[Swarm Oracle: Trustless Blockchain Agreements through Robot Swarms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15956v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain consensus, rooted in the principle ``don't trust, verify'', limits access to real-world data, which may be ambiguous or inaccessible to some participants. Oracles address this limitation by supplying data to blockchains, but existing solutions may reduce autonomy, transparency, or reintroduce the need for trust. We propose Swarm Oracle: a decentralized network of autonomous robots -- that is, a robot swarm -- that use onboard sensors and peer-to-peer communication to collectively verify real-world data and provide it to smart contracts on public blockchains. Swarm Oracle leverages the built-in decentralization, fault tolerance and mobility of robot swarms, which can flexibly adapt to meet information requests on-demand, even in remote locations. Unlike typical cooperative robot swarms, Swarm Oracle integrates robots from multiple stakeholders, protecting the system from single-party biases but also introducing potential adversarial behavior. To ensure the secure, trustless and global consensus required by blockchains, we employ a Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that enables robots from different stakeholders to operate together, reaching social agreements of higher quality than the estimates of individual robots. Through extensive experiments using both real and simulated robots, we showcase how consensus on uncertain environmental information can be achieved, despite several types of attacks orchestrated by large proportions of the robots, and how a reputation system based on blockchain tokens lets Swarm Oracle autonomously recover from faults and attacks, a requirement for long-term operation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce VLAC, a general process reward model built upon InternVL and trained on large scale heterogeneous datasets. Given pairwise observations and a language goal, it outputs dense progress delta and done signal, eliminating task-specific reward engineering, and supports one-shot in-context transfer to unseen tasks and environments. VLAC is trained on vision-language datasets to strengthen perception, dialogic and reasoning capabilities, together with robot and human trajectories data that ground action generation and progress estimation, and additionally strengthened to reject irrelevant prompts as well as detect regression or stagnation by constructing large numbers of negative and semantically mismatched samples. With prompt control, a single VLAC model alternately generating reward and action tokens, unifying critic and policy. Deployed inside an asynchronous real-world RL loop, we layer a graded human-in-the-loop protocol (offline demonstration replay, return and explore, human guided explore) that accelerates exploration and stabilizes early learning. Across four distinct real-world manipulation tasks, VLAC lifts success rates from about 30\% to about 90\% within 200 real-world interaction episodes; incorporating human-in-the-loop interventions yields a further 50% improvement in sample efficiency and achieves up to 100% final success.</p></details> | 26 pages,10 figures |

| **[Improving Robotic Manipulation with Efficient Geometry-Aware Vision Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15880v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing RGB-based imitation learning approaches typically employ traditional vision encoders such as ResNet or ViT, which lack explicit 3D reasoning capabilities. Recent geometry-grounded vision models, such as VGGT~\cite{wang2025vggt}, provide robust spatial understanding and are promising candidates to address this limitation. This work investigates the integration of geometry-aware visual representations into robotic manipulation. Our results suggest that incorporating the geometry-aware vision encoder into imitation learning frameworks, including ACT and DP, yields up to 6.5% improvement over standard vision encoders in success rate across single- and bi-manual manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world settings. Despite these benefits, most geometry-grounded models require high computational cost, limiting their deployment in practical robotic systems. To address this challenge, we propose eVGGT, an efficient geometry-aware encoder distilled from VGGT. eVGGT is nearly 9 times faster and 5 times smaller than VGGT, while preserving strong 3D reasoning capabilities. Code and pretrained models will be released to facilitate further research in geometry-aware robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 fig...</summary><p>9 figures, 7 tables.

An EMLA model is formulated to capture motor electromechanics and direction-dependent transmission efficiencies, while a mathematical model of the HDRM, incorporating both kinematics and dynamics, is established to generate joint-space motion profiles for prescribed TCP trajectories. A safety-ensured trajectory generator, tailored to this model, maps Cartesian goals to joint space while enforcing joint-limit and velocity margins. Based on the resulting force and velocity demands, a multi-objective Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed to select the optimal EMLA configuration. To accelerate this optimization, a deep neural network, trained with EMLA parameters, is embedded in the optimization process to predict steady-state actuator efficiency from trajectory profiles. For the chosen EMLA design, a physics-informed Kriging surrogate, anchored to the analytic model and refined with experimental data, learns residuals of EMLA outputs to support force and velocity sensorless control. The actuator model is further embedded in a hierarchical virtual decomposition control (VDC) framework that outputs voltage commands. Experimental validation on a one-degree-of-freedom EMLA testbed confirms accurate trajectory tracking and effective sensorless control under varying loads.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by this, we present GP3 -- a 3D geometry-aware robotic manipulation policy that leverages multi-view input. GP3 employs a spatial encoder to infer dense spatial features from RGB observations, which enable the estimation of depth and camera parameters, leading to a compact yet expressive 3D scene representation tailored for manipulation. This representation is fused with language instructions and translated into continuous actions via a lightweight policy head. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GP3 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on simulated benchmarks. Furthermore, GP3 transfers effectively to real-world robots without depth sensors or pre-mapped environments, requiring only minimal fine-tuning. These results highlight GP3 as a practical, sensor-agnostic solution for geometry-aware robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |

While RPA has gained popularity for its cost-effective and timely automation of rule-based, well-structured tasks, its symbolic nature has inherent limitations when approaching more complex tasks currently performed by human agents. Machine learning concepts enabling intelligent RPA provide an opportunity to broaden the range of automatable tasks. In this paper, we conduct a literature review to explore the connections between RPA and machine learning and organize the joint concept intelligent RPA into a taxonomy. Our taxonomy comprises the two meta-characteristics RPA-ML integration and RPA-ML interaction. Together, they comprise eight dimensions: architecture and ecosystem, capabilities, data basis, intelligence level, and technical depth of integration as well as deployment environment, lifecycle phase, and user-robot relation.</p></details> |  |

This requires robots with intelligent interaction abilities to work naturally and effectively with humans. However, current robotic simulators fail to support real human participation, limiting their ability to provide authentic interaction experiences and gather valuable human feedback essential for enhancing robotic capabilities. In this paper, we introduce SymBridge, the first human-in-the-loop cyber-physical interactive system designed to enable the safe and efficient development, evaluation, and optimization of human-robot interaction methods. Specifically, we employ augmented reality technology to enable real humans to interact with virtual robots in physical environments, creating an authentic interactive experience. Building on this, we propose a novel robotic interaction model that generates responsive, precise robot actions in real time through continuous human behavior observation. The model incorporates multi-resolution human motion features and environmental affordances, ensuring contextually adaptive robotic responses. Additionally, SymBridge enables continuous robot learning by collecting human feedback and dynamically adapting the robotic interaction model. By leveraging a carefully designed system architecture and modules, SymBridge builds a bridge between humans and robots, as well as between cyber and physical spaces, providing a natural and realistic online interaction experience while facilitating the continuous evolution of robotic intelligence. Extensive experiments, user studies, and real robot testing demonstrate the promising performance of the system and highlight its potential to significantly advance research on human-robot symbiosis.</p></details> |  |

Of the miniature robots, the magnetically actuated ones are the most functional and dexterous. However, existing magnetic miniature robots are currently impractical for surgery because they are either restricted to possessing at most two on-board functionalities or having limited five degrees-of-freedom (DOF) locomotion. Some of these actuators are also only operational under specialized environments where actuation from strong external magnets must be at very close proximity (< 4 cm away). Here we present a millimeter-scale soft robot where its magnetization profile can be reprogrammed upon command to perform five surgical functionalities: drug-dispensing, cutting through biological tissues (simulated with gelatin), gripping, storing (biological) samples and remote heating. By possessing full six-DOF motions, including the sixth-DOF rotation about its net magnetic moment, our soft robot can also roll and two-anchor crawl across challenging unstructured environments, which are impassable by its five-DOF counterparts. Because our actuating magnetic fields are relatively uniform and weak (at most 65 mT and 1.5 T/m), such fields can theoretically penetrate through biological tissues harmlessly and allow our soft robot to remain controllable within the depths of the human body. We envision that this work marks a major milestone for the advancement of soft actuators, and towards revolutionizing minimally invasive treatments with untethered miniature robots that have unprecedented functionalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First three listed authors are equally contributing authors.

The framework integrates sensing, navigation, and control, forming a closed-loop system for the robot. The core novelty of this framework lies in two interactive and complementary components within the control module: the high-performance (HP)-Student and the high-assurance (HA)-Teacher. HP-Student is a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent that engages in self-learning and teaching-to-learn to develop a safe and high-performance action policy. HA-Teacher is a simplified yet verifiable physics-model-based controller, with the role of teaching HP-Student about safety while providing a backup for the robot's safe locomotion. HA-Teacher is innovative due to its real-time physics model, real-time action policy, and real-time control goals, all tailored to respond effectively to real-time wild environments, ensuring safety. The framework also includes a coordinator who effectively manages the interaction between HP-Student and HA-Teacher. Experiments involving a Unitree Go2 robot in Nvidia Isaac Gym and comparisons with state-of-the-art safe DRLs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed runtime learning framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Affordance-Based Disambiguation of Surgical Instructions for Collaborative Robot-Assisted Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14967v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective human-robot collaboration in surgery is affected by the inherent ambiguity of verbal communication. This paper presents a framework for a robotic surgical assistant that interprets and disambiguates verbal instructions from a surgeon by grounding them in the visual context of the operating field. The system employs a two-level affordance-based reasoning process that first analyzes the surgical scene using a multimodal vision-language model and then reasons about the instruction using a knowledge base of tool capabilities. To ensure patient safety, a dual-set conformal prediction method is used to provide a statistically rigorous confidence measure for robot decisions, allowing it to identify and flag ambiguous commands. We evaluated our framework on a curated dataset of ambiguous surgical requests from cholecystectomy videos, demonstrating a general disambiguation rate of 60% and presenting a method for safer human-robot interaction in the operating room.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 1st Workshop on Intelligent Cobodied Assistance and Robotic Empowerment (iCARE). 2025 Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)</p></details> |
| **[STARC: See-Through-Wall Augmented Reality Framework for Human-Robot Collaboration in Emergency Response](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15507v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In emergency response missions, first responders must navigate cluttered indoor environments where occlusions block direct line-of-sight, concealing both life-threatening hazards and victims in need of rescue. We present STARC, a see-through AR framework for human-robot collaboration that fuses mobile-robot mapping with responder-mounted LiDAR sensing. A ground robot running LiDAR-inertial odometry performs large-area exploration and 3D human detection, while helmet- or handheld-mounted LiDAR on the responder is registered to the robot's global map via relative pose estimation. This cross-LiDAR alignment enables consistent first-person projection of detected humans and their point clouds - rendered in AR with low latency - into the responder's view. By providing real-time visualization of hidden occupants and hazards, STARC enhances situational awareness and reduces operator risk. Experiments in simulation, lab setups, and tactical field trials confirm robust pose alignment, reliable detections, and stable overlays, underscoring the potential of our system for fire-fighting, disaster relief, and other safety-critical operations. Code and design will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lateral oscillation and body compliance help snakes and snake robots stably traverse large, smooth obstacles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13733v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snakes can move through almost any terrain. Similarly, snake robots hold the promise as a versatile platform to traverse complex environments like earthquake rubble. Unlike snake locomotion on flat surfaces which is inherently stable, when snakes traverse complex terrain by deforming their body out of plane, it becomes challenging to maintain stability. Here, we review our recent progress in understanding how snakes and snake robots traverse large, smooth obstacles that lack anchor points for gripping or bracing. First, we discovered that the generalist variable kingsnake combines lateral oscillation and cantilevering. Regardless of step height and surface friction, the overall gait is preserved. Next, to quantify static stability of the snake, we developed a method to interpolate continuous body in three dimensions (both position and orientation) between discrete tracked markers. By analyzing the base of support using the interpolated continuous body 3-D kinematics, we discovered that the snake maintained perfect stability during traversal, even on the most challenging low friction, high step. Finally, we applied this gait to a snake robot and systematically tested its performance traversing large steps with variable heights to further understand stability principles. The robot rapidly and stably traversed steps nearly as high as a third of its body length. As step height increased, the robot rolled more frequently to the extent of flipping over, reducing traversal probability. The absence of such failure in the snake with a compliant body inspired us to add body compliance to the robot. With better surface contact, the compliant body robot suffered less roll instability and traversed high steps at higher probability, without sacrificing traversal speed. Our robot traversed large step-like obstacles more rapidly than most previous snake robots, approaching that of the animal.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable AI-Enhanced Supervisory Control for Robust Multi-Agent Robotic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15491v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an explainable AI-enhanced supervisory control framework for multi-agent robotics that combines (i) a timed-automata supervisor for safe, auditable mode switching, (ii) robust continuous control (Lyapunov-based controller for large-angle maneuver; sliding-mode controller (SMC) with boundary layers for precision and disturbance rejection), and (iii) an explainable predictor that maps mission context to gains and expected performance (energy, error). Monte Carlo-driven optimization provides the training data, enabling transparent real-time trade-offs. We validated the approach in two contrasting domains, spacecraft formation flying and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Despite different environments (gravity/actuator bias vs. hydrodynamic drag/currents), both share uncertain six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) rigid-body dynamics, relative motion, and tight tracking needs, making them representative of general robotic systems. In the space mission, the supervisory logic selects parameters that meet mission criteria. In AUV leader-follower tests, the same SMC structure maintains a fixed offset under stochastic currents with bounded steady error. In spacecraft validation, the SMC controller achieved submillimeter alignment with 21.7% lower tracking error and 81.4% lower energy consumption compared to Proportional-Derivative PD controller baselines. At the same time, in AUV tests, SMC maintained bounded errors under stochastic currents. These results highlight both the portability and the interpretability of the approach for safety-critical, resource-constrained multi-agent robotics.</p></details> |  |

We design a semi-automatic calibration procedure to enable fusion of stereo-vision-based 3D robot tracking with high-power beam steering, and a low-power optical communication scheme that reuses the laser light as a data channel. We fabricate a Phaser prototype using off-the-shelf hardware and evaluate its performance with battery-free autonomous robots. Phaser delivers optical power densities of over 110 mW/cm$^2$ and error-free data to mobile robots at multi-meter ranges, with on-board decoding drawing 0.3 mA ($97\%$ less current than Bluetooth Low Energy). We demonstrate Phaser fully powering gram-scale battery-free robots to nearly 2x higher speeds than prior work while simultaneously controlling them to navigate around obstacles and along paths.

| **[Model-Free and Real-Time Unicycle-Based Source Seeking with Differential Wheeled Robotic Experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02184v5)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many autonomous robots aimed at source-seeking are studied, and their controls designed, using unicycle modeling and formulation. This is true not only for model-based controllers, but also for model-free, real-time control methods such as extremum seeking control (ESC). In this paper, we propose a unicycle-based ESC design applicable to differential wheeled robots that: (1) is very simple design, based on one simple control-affine law, and without state integrators; (2) attenuates oscillations known to persist in ESC designs (i.e., fully stop at the source); and (3) operates in a model-free, real-time setting, tolerating environmental/sensor noise. We provide simulation and real-world robotic experimental results for fixed and moving light source seeking by a differential wheeled robot using our proposed design. Results indicate clear advantages of our proposed design when compared to the literature, including attenuation of undesired oscillations, improved convergence speed, and better handling of noise.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories, thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction. Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub Project: https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/RynnVLA-001</p></details> |
| **[Parallel Simulation of Contact and Actuation for Soft Growing Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15180v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth, bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts. We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 9 figures, 1 table.

| **[GAF: Gaussian Action Field as a Dynamic World Model for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14135v3)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate scene perception is critical for vision-based robotic manipulation. Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we adopt a V-4D-A framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing 4D modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF provides three interrelated outputs: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of init action via Gaussian motion. Furthermore, we employ an action-vision-aligned denoising framework, conditioned on a unified representation that combines the init action and the Gaussian perception, both generated by the GAF, to further obtain more precise actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR, +0.3864 SSIM and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average +7.3% success rate in robotic manipulation tasks over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>http:...</summary><p>http://chaiying1.github.io/GAF.github.io/project_page/</p></details> |

A task graph specifies the tasks and their relationships, and a set of reward functions models the effects of coalition size and preceding task performance. Maximizing task rewards is NP-hard; hence, we propose network flow-based algorithms to approximate solutions efficiently. A novel online algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed-integer solver and a greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced simulator, modeling reward functions based on realistic physical phenomena and executing the tasks with realistic robot dynamics. Results establish efficacy in modeling complex missions and efficiency in generating high-fidelity task plans while leveraging task relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 19 figures, Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TR-O) August 2025</p></details> |
| **[RoboEye: Enhancing 2D Robotic Object Identification with Selective 3D Geometric Keypoint Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14966v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary, preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a 3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images, avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code used in this paper is publicly available at: https://github.com/longkukuhi/RoboEye.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-CAP: A Multi-Robot Connectivity-Aware Hierarchical Coverage Path Planning Algorithm for Unknown Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14941v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time, total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner in achieving these performance gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Control Stack: A Lean Ecosystem for Robot Learning at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14932v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning. They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots, facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance.

| **[PERAL: Perception-Aware Motion Control for Passive LiDAR Excitation in Spherical Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14915v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous mobile robots increasingly rely on LiDAR-IMU odometry for navigation and mapping, yet horizontally mounted LiDARs such as the MID360 capture few near-ground returns, limiting terrain awareness and degrading performance in feature-scarce environments. Prior solutions - static tilt, active rotation, or high-density sensors - either sacrifice horizontal perception or incur added actuators, cost, and power. We introduce PERAL, a perception-aware motion control framework for spherical robots that achieves passive LiDAR excitation without dedicated hardware. By modeling the coupling between internal differential-drive actuation and sensor attitude, PERAL superimposes bounded, non-periodic oscillations onto nominal goal- or trajectory-tracking commands, enriching vertical scan diversity while preserving navigation accuracy. Implemented on a compact spherical robot, PERAL is validated across laboratory, corridor, and tactical environments. Experiments demonstrate up to 96 percent map completeness, a 27 percent reduction in trajectory tracking error, and robust near-ground human detection, all at lower weight, power, and cost compared with static tilt, active rotation, and fixed horizontal baselines. The design and code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-araVLN: Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06644v4)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agricultural robotic agents have been becoming powerful helpers in a wide range of agricultural tasks, however, still heavily rely on manual operation or fixed railways for movement. To address this limitation, the AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling agents to navigate to the target positions following the natural language instructions. AgriVLN effectively understands the simple instructions, but often misunderstands the complex ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation (T-araVLN), in which the Instruction Translator module translates the original instruction to be more refined and precise. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.63 and reduces Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.28m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

| **[Scalable Multi-Objective Robot Reinforcement Learning through Gradient Conflict Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14816v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology, GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks. We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement. The code is available at https://github.com/humphreymunn/GCR-PPO.</p></details> |  |
