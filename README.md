| **[LLaPa: A Vision-Language Model Framework for Counterfactual-Aware Procedural Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08496v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are available https://github.com/sunshibo1234/LLaPa.</p></details> |  |
| **[SURPRISE3D: A Dataset for Spatial Understanding and Reasoning in Complex 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07781v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world. Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research. Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite. S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic planning. The code and datasets can be found in https://github.com/liziwennba/SUPRISE.</p></details> |  |
| **[MapNav: A Novel Memory Representation via Annotated Semantic Maps for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13451v4)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a key task in Embodied AI, requiring agents to navigate diverse and unseen environments while following natural language instructions. Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPT-Bench: A Large-Scale, Long-Term and Robot-Egocentric Dataset for Benchmarking Target Person Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07446v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking a target person from robot-egocentric views is crucial for developing autonomous robots that provide continuous personalized assistance or collaboration in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Embodied AI. However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoramic images, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 48 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing SOTA TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |
| **[A Neural Representation Framework with LLM-Driven Spatial Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06719v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical feature field. This field represents language and instance features using distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations, outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their spatial reasoning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamArt: Generating Interactable Articulated Objects from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05763v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR. Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated asset generation.

| **[PAPRLE (Plug-And-Play Robotic Limb Environment): A Modular Ecosystem for Robotic Limbs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05555v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce PAPRLE (Plug-And-Play Robotic Limb Environment), a modular ecosystem that enables flexible placement and control of robotic limbs. With PAPRLE, a user can change the arrangement of the robotic limbs, and control them using a variety of input devices, including puppeteers, gaming controllers, and VR-based interfaces. This versatility supports a wide range of teleoperation scenarios and promotes adaptability to different task requirements. To further enhance configurability, we introduce a pluggable puppeteer device that can be easily mounted and adapted to match the target robot configurations. PAPRLE supports bilateral teleoperation through these puppeteer devices, agnostic to the type or configuration of the follower robot. By supporting both joint-space and task-space control, the system provides real-time force feedback, improving user fidelity and physical interaction awareness. The modular design of PAPRLE facilitates novel spatial arrangements of the limbs and enables scalable data collection, thereby advancing research in embodied AI and learning-based control. We validate PAPRLE in various real-world settings, demonstrating its versatility across diverse combinations of leader devices and follower robots. The system will be released as open source, including both hardware and software components, to support broader adoption and community-driven extension. Additional resources and demonstrations are available at the project website: https://uiuckimlab.github.io/paprle-pages</p></details> |  |
| **[ViGiL3D: A Linguistically Diverse Dataset for 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01366v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D visual grounding (3DVG) involves localizing entities in a 3D scene referred to by natural language text. Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages with 8 figures and 14 tables; updated for ACL 2025 camera-ready with additional discussion and figures</p></details> |
| **[EmbodieDreamer: Advancing Real2Sim2Real Transfer for Policy Training via Embodied World Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05198v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner, a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap. It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74% compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by 89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://embodiedreamer.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Embodied AI Agents: Modeling the World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22355v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices, and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings, which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents, allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free Generation of Temporally Consistent Rewards from VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04789v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks, demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://t2-vlm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimLauncher: Launching Sample-Efficient Real-world Robotic Reinforcement Learning via Simulation Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04452v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection, while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment, which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboBrain 2.0 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02029v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce RoboBrain 2.0, our latest generation of embodied vision-language foundation models, designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents. The code, checkpoint and benchmark are available at https://superrobobrain.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic 3D Scene Generation with Spatially Contextualized VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20129v3)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

While single-arm systems have shown strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025. Built on the RoboTwin Simulation platform (1.0 and 2.0) and the AgileX COBOT-Magic Robot platform, the competition consisted of three stages: Simulation Round 1, Simulation Round 2, and a final Real-World Round. Participants totally tackled 17 dual-arm manipulation tasks, covering rigid, deformable, and tactile-based scenarios. The challenge attracted 64 global teams and over 400 participants, producing top-performing solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3 and generating valuable insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning. This report outlines the competition setup, task design, evaluation methodology, key findings and future direction, aiming to support future research on robust and generalizable bimanual manipulation policies.

| **[TC-Light: Temporally Coherent Generative Rendering for Realistic World Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18904v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Illumination and texture editing are critical dimensions for world-to-world transfer, which is valuable for applications including sim2real and real2real visual data scaling up for embodied AI. Existing techniques generatively re-render the input video to realize the transfer, such as video relighting models and conditioned world generation models. Nevertheless, these models are predominantly limited to the domain of training data (e.g., portrait) or fall into the bottleneck of temporal consistency and computation efficiency, especially when the input video involves complex dynamics and long durations. In this paper, we propose TC-Light, a novel generative renderer to overcome these problems. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark. Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible re-rendering results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

| **[What does really matter in image goal navigation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01667v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image goal navigation requires two different skills: firstly, core navigation skills, including the detection of free space and obstacles, and taking decisions based on an internal representation; and secondly, computing directional information by comparing visual observations to the goal image. Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking, space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings, leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend. We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.</p></details> |  |
| **[Articulate3D: Holistic Understanding of 3D Scenes as Universal Scene Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01398v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene understanding is a long-standing challenge in computer vision and a key component in enabling mixed reality, wearable computing, and embodied AI. Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets and algorithms approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered in the research field. In this work, we address this shortcoming by introducing: (1) Articulate3D, an expertly curated 3D dataset featuring high-quality manual annotations on 280 indoor scenes. Articulate3D provides 8 types of annotations for articulated objects, covering parts and detailed motion information, all stored in a standardized scene representation format designed for scalable 3D content creation, exchange and seamless integration into simulation environments. (2) USDNet, a novel unified framework capable of simultaneously predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes for articulated objects. We evaluate USDNet on Articulate3D as well as two existing datasets, demonstrating the advantage of our unified dense prediction approach. Furthermore, we highlight the value of Articulate3D through cross-dataset and cross-domain evaluations and showcase its applicability in downstream tasks such as scene editing through LLM prompting and robotic policy training for articulated object manipulation. We provide open access to our dataset, benchmark, and method's source code.</p></details> |  |

Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems. We also maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature and open-source projects at https://github.com/NJU3DV-LoongGroup/Embodied-World-Models-Survey.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/NJU3DV-LoongGroup/Embodied-World-Models-Survey</p></details> |

This article introduces a conceptual framework for designing and analyzing CAI. It delineates key attributes including task generalization, resilience, scalability, and self-assembly, aiming to bridge theoretical foundations with practical methodologies for engineering adaptive, emergent intelligence. By providing a structured foundation for understanding and implementing CAI, this work seeks to guide researchers and practitioners in developing more resilient, scalable, and adaptable AI systems across various domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[STI-Bench: Are MLLMs Ready for Precise Spatial-Temporal World Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23765v5)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[CL-Splats: Continual Learning of Gaussian Splatting with Local Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21117v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI. As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Project Page: https://cl-splats.github.io</p></details> |

Current language model-based navigation systems operate on discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient, reward-driven post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: vlnr1.github.io</p></details> |
| **[From 2D to 3D Cognition: A Brief Survey of General World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20134v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models have garnered increasing attention in the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), serving as computational frameworks for learning representations of the external world and forecasting future states. While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent 3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward 3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing 3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in 3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning, and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing more robust and generalizable 3D world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Multi-sensor Fusion Perception for Embodied AI: Background, Methods, Challenges and Prospects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19769v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI, which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion, while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods. A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

The recent rise of AI scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning, and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration, and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven science.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting 19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks. We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs in practical applications such as robotics and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional cloud-based telerobotics suffers from latency, reliability, scalability, and resilience issues, hindering real-time performance in critical applications. Cloud-Fog Telerobotics (CFTel) builds on the Cloud-Fog Automation (CFA) paradigm to address these limitations by leveraging a distributed Cloud-Edge-Robotics computing architecture, enabling deterministic connectivity, deterministic connected intelligence, and deterministic networked computing. This paper synthesizes recent advancements in CFTel, aiming to highlight its role in facilitating scalable, low-latency, autonomous, and AI-driven telerobotics. We analyze architectural frameworks and technologies that enable them, including 5G Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication, Edge Intelligence, Embodied AI, and Digital Twins. The study demonstrates that CFTel has the potential to enhance real-time control, scalability, and autonomy while supporting service-oriented solutions. We also discuss practical challenges, including latency constraints, cybersecurity risks, interoperability issues, and standardization efforts.

| **[Adapting Vision-Language Models for Evaluating World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17967v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable, semantics-aware evaluator for world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Embodied AI: Advances and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05108v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in simulation platforms have greatly enhanced task diversity to train embodied Vision Language Models (VLMs), most platforms rely on simplified robot morphologies and bypass the stochastic nature of low-level execution, which limits their transferability to real-world robots. To address these issues, we present a physics-based simulation platform DualTHOR for complex dual-arm humanoid robots, built upon an extended version of AI2-THOR. Our simulator includes real-world robot assets, a task suite for dual-arm collaboration, and inverse kinematics solvers for humanoid robots. We also introduce a contingency mechanism that incorporates potential failures through physics-based low-level execution, bridging the gap to real-world scenarios. Our simulator enables a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness and generalization of VLMs in household environments. Extensive evaluations reveal that current VLMs struggle with dual-arm coordination and exhibit limited robustness in realistic environments with contingencies, highlighting the importance of using our simulator to develop more capable VLMs for embodied tasks.

Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Across diverse settings within Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality, introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

Despite the progress made by existing methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results, their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning (WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their capabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and deformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the lack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under diverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for generating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac features a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional tactile sensors \sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip detection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips. Furthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis pipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based on this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm robotic system. Experiments demonstrate that PP-Tac can effectively grasp paper-like objects of varying material, thickness, and stiffness, achieving an overall success rate of 87.5\%. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to grasp paper-like deformable objects using a tactile dexterous hand.

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

The diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI. However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation. EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging generative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the needs of embodied intelligence related research.

Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy-action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle action-related and distracting dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Workshop on World Models at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025, Poster, Project Page: https://laom.dunnolab.ai/, Source code: https://github.com/dunnolab/laom</p></details> |

Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.</p></details> |  |

However, previous navigation research is divided into different tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents, which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1. Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1, we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e., Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically, we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability. Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Analytic Task Scheduler: Recursive Least Squares Based Method for Continual Learning in Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09623v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied foundation models are crucial for Artificial Intelligence (AI) interacting with the physical world by integrating multi-modal inputs, such as proprioception, vision and language, to understand human intentions and generate actions to control robots. While these models demonstrate strong generalization and few-shot learning capabilities, they face significant challenges in continually acquiring new skills without forgetting previously learned skills, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for continual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a task-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a single task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares (RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific models. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model selection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The scheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics (autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant learning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a real-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to forgetting and strong adaptability to task variations. The results highlight ATS as an effective, scalable, and deployable solution for continual learning in embodied foundation models operating in complex, dynamic environments. Our code will be available at https://github.com/MIAA-Embodied-AI/AnalyticTaskScheduler</p></details> |  |
| **[What Can RL Bring to VLA Generalization? An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO.

| **[VIKI-R: Coordinating Embodied Multi-Agent Cooperation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09049v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://faceong.github.io/VIKI-R/</p></details> |

Understanding their kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$ larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos, outperforming existing methods significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website can be found at https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/video2articulation/</p></details> |

We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://metadriverse.github.io/dreamland/</p></details> |

Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

| **[LLM-driven Indoor Scene Layout Generation via Scaled Human-aligned Data Synthesis and Multi-Stage Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07570v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches such as Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes. Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such as drones and mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025 Embodied AI Workshop</p></details> |
| **[DaDu-Corki: Algorithm-Architecture Co-Design for Embodied AI-powered Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04292v5)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI robots have the potential to fundamentally improve the way human beings live and manufacture. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate, and this trend is strongly evident in manipulation tasks. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots for manipulation tasks are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes \textsc{Corki}\xspace, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI-powered robotic manipulation applications. We aim to decouple LLM inference, robotic control, and data communication in the embodied AI robots' compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, \textsc{Corki}\xspace predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. \textsc{Corki}\xspace largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to $5.1\times$, resulting in up to $5.9\times$ speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 13.9\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucinate, Ground, Repeat: A Framework for Generalized Visual Relationship Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05651v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence (maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21 held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed. Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors for scalable open-world visual understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05341v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://directlayout.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[OGGSplat: Open Gaussian Growing for Generalizable Reconstruction with Expanded Field-of-View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05204v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards provable probabilistic safety for scalable embodied AI systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05171v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. To address this challenge, we introduce provable probabilistic safety, which aims to ensure that the residual risk of large-scale deployment remains below a predefined threshold. Instead of attempting exhaustive safety proof across all corner cases, this paradigm establishes a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance, leveraging statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability. A well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale while allowing for continuous refinement of safety guarantees. Our work focuses on three core questions: what is provable probabilistic safety, how to prove the probabilistic safety, and how to achieve the provable probabilistic safety. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, our work offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  |

Both components employ modular 3D-printed finger designs, achieving ultra-low manufacturing costs while maintaining full actuation capabilities. Departing from conventional tendon-driven or underactuated approaches, our electromechanical system integrates independent joint motors across all 23 DoF, ensuring complete state observability and accurate kinematic modeling. This full-actuation architecture enables precise bidirectional kinematic calculations, substantially enhancing kinematic retargeting fidelity between the exoskeleton and robotic hand. The proposed system bridges the cost-performance gap in dexterous manipulation research, providing an accessible platform for acquiring high-quality demonstration data to advance embodied AI and dexterous robotic skill transfer learning.</p></details> |  |

We begin with a practical challenge: training a cross-morphology embodied AI policy that generalizes across diverse robot morphologies. We formalize this as the Heterogeneous Embodied Agent Training (HEAT) problem and prove it reduces to a structured Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that is PSPACE-complete. This result explains why current reinforcement learning pipelines break down under morphological diversity, due to sequential training constraints, memory-policy coupling, and data incompatibility. We further explore Collective Adaptation, a distributed learning alternative inspired by biological systems. Though NEXP-complete in theory, it offers meaningful scalability and deployment benefits in practice. This work illustrates how computational theory can illuminate system design trade-offs and guide the development of more robust, scalable embodied AI. For practitioners and researchers to explore this problem, the implementation code of this work has been made publicly available at https://github.com/airs-admin/HEAT</p></details> |  |

Traditional learning-based methods rely heavily on large-scale annotated data or require extensive interaction with the environment in a reinforcement learning setting, often failing to generalize to novel environments and limiting scalability. To overcome these challenges, we explore a zero-shot setting where the agent operates without task-specific training, enabling more scalable and adaptable solution. Recent advances in Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) offer powerful capabilities for visual understanding and reasoning, making them ideal for agents to comprehend scenes, identify relevant regions, and infer the likely locations of objects. In this work, we present a zero-shot object goal navigation framework that integrates the perceptual strength of VFMs with a model-based planner that is capable of long-horizon decision making through frontier exploration. We evaluate our approach on the HM3D dataset using the Habitat simulator and demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of success weighted by path length for zero-shot object goal navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 workshop - Foundation Models Meet Embodied Agents</p></details> |

Specifically, Map and Locate involves generating a point cloud from an unposed video and segmenting object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task serves as a critical step toward real-world embodied AI applications and introduces a practical task that bridges reconstruction, recognition and reorganization. To tackle this task, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline, which we denote as SAB3R. Our approach builds upon MASt3R, a recent breakthrough in 3D computer vision, and incorporates a lightweight distillation strategy. This method transfers dense, per-pixel semantic features from 2D vision backbones (eg, CLIP and DINOv2) to enhance MASt3R's capabilities. Without introducing any auxiliary frozen networks, our model generates per-pixel semantic features and constructs cohesive point maps in a single forward pass. Compared to separately deploying MASt3R and CLIP, our unified model, SAB3R, achieves superior performance on the Map and Locate benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate SAB3R on both 2D semantic segmentation and 3D tasks to comprehensively validate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>3D-LL...</summary><p>3D-LLM/VLA @ CVPR2025 | Project page: https://uva-computer-vision-lab.github.io/sab3r/</p></details> |

We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric video contexts. EgoVLM is fine-tuned via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method adapted to align model outputs with human-like reasoning steps. Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought (CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by 14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability, making it well-suited for downstream applications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel keyframe-based reward that incorporates salient frame selection to guide reinforcement learning optimization.

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |

However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains.

Recent learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure. To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time. Rig raymaps allow the model to infer rig structure directly from input images when metadata is missing. Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.</p></details> |  |

While existing audio spatialization methods can generally map any available monaural audio to binaural audio signals, they often lack the flexible and interactive control needed in complex multi-object user-interactive environments. To address this, we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes flexible text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and comprehension perspectives. Due to the limited availability of premium and large-scale stereo data, we construct the SpatialTAS dataset, which encompasses 376,000 simulated binaural audio samples to facilitate the training of our model. Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and relative position prompts, augmented by flipped-channel audio. It outperforms existing methods on both simulated and real-recorded datasets, demonstrating superior generalization and accuracy. Besides, we develop an assessment model based on Llama-3.1-8B, which evaluates the spatial semantic coherence between our generated binaural audio and text prompts through a spatial reasoning task. Results demonstrate that text prompts provide flexible and interactive control to generate binaural audio with excellent quality and semantic consistency in spatial locations.

Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, i.e., pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the representation strategy. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multifaceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multimodal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions.

We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy. For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

While more robotics datasets are being created, the landscape of open data in the field is uneven. This is due to a lack of curation standards and consistent publication practices, which makes it difficult to discover, access, and reuse robotics data. To address these challenges, this paper presents a curation and access system with two main contributions: (1) a structured methodology to curate, publish, and integrate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) human-centered robotics datasets; and (2) a ChatGPT-powered conversational interface trained with the curated datasets metadata and documentation to enable exploration, comparison robotics datasets and data retrieval using natural language. Developed based on practical experience curating datasets from robotics labs within Texas Robotics at the University of Texas at Austin, the system demonstrates the value of standardized curation and persistent publication of robotics data. The system's evaluation suggests that access and understandability of human-robotics data are significantly improved. This work directly aligns with the goals of the HCRL @ ICRA 2025 workshop and represents a step towards more human-centered access to data for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages (excluding references), 8 pages (including references); 5 figures; accepted to the ICRA 2025 Workshop on Human-Centered Robot Learning in the Era of Big Data and Large Models</p></details> |

Egocentric Spatial Reasoning in VLMs Across Disjoint Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24257v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An embodied AI assistant operating on egocentric video must integrate spatial cues across time - for instance, determining where an object A, glimpsed a few moments ago lies relative to an object B encountered later. We introduce Disjoint-3DQA , a generative QA benchmark that evaluates this ability of VLMs by posing questions about object pairs that are not co-visible in the same frame. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art VLMs and found that models lag behind human performance by 28%, with steeper declines in accuracy (60% to 30 %) as the temporal gap widens. Our analysis further reveals that providing trajectories or bird's-eye-view projections to VLMs results in only marginal improvements, whereas providing oracle 3D coordinates leads to a substantial 20% performance increase. This highlights a core bottleneck of multi-frame VLMs in constructing and maintaining 3D scene representations over time from visual signals. Disjoint-3DQA therefore sets a clear, measurable challenge for long-horizon spatial reasoning and aims to catalyze future research at the intersection of vision, language, and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing simulation frameworks typically support a narrow range of scenes/tasks and lack features critical for scaling generalizable robotics and sim2real. We introduce and open source ManiSkill3, the fastest state-visual GPU parallelized robotics simulator with contact-rich physics targeting generalizable manipulation. ManiSkill3 supports GPU parallelization of many aspects including simulation+rendering, heterogeneous simulation, pointclouds/voxels visual input, and more. Simulation with rendering on ManiSkill3 can run 10-1000x faster with 2-3x less GPU memory usage than other platforms, achieving up to 30,000+ FPS in benchmarked environments due to minimal python/pytorch overhead in the system, simulation on the GPU, and the use of the SAPIEN parallel rendering system. Tasks that used to take hours to train can now take minutes. We further provide the most comprehensive range of GPU parallelized environments/tasks spanning 12 distinct domains including but not limited to mobile manipulation for tasks such as drawing, humanoids, and dextrous manipulation in realistic scenes designed by artists or real-world digital twins. In addition, millions of demonstration frames are provided from motion planning, RL, and teleoperation. ManiSkill3 also provides a comprehensive set of baselines that span popular RL and learning-from-demonstrations algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://maniskill.ai/</p></details> |

Modeling hand-object interaction priors holds significant potential to advance robotic and embodied AI systems in learning to operate effectively within the physical world. We introduce SIGHT, a novel task focused on generating realistic and physically plausible 3D hand-object interaction trajectories from a single image and a brief language-based task description. Prior work on hand-object trajectory generation typically relies on textual input that lacks explicit grounding to the target object, or assumes access to 3D object meshes, which are often considerably more difficult to obtain than 2D images. We propose SIGHT-Fusion, a novel diffusion-based image-text conditioned generative model that tackles this task by retrieving the most similar 3D object mesh from a database and enforcing geometric hand-object interaction constraints via a novel inference-time diffusion guidance. We benchmark our model on the HOI4D and H2O datasets, adapting relevant baselines for this novel task. Experiments demonstrate our superior performance in the diversity and quality of generated trajectories, as well as in hand-object interaction geometry metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrackVLA: Embodied Visual Tracking in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23189v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied visual tracking is a fundamental skill in Embodied AI, enabling an agent to follow a specific target in dynamic environments using only egocentric vision. This task is inherently challenging as it requires both accurate target recognition and effective trajectory planning under conditions of severe occlusion and high scene dynamics. Existing approaches typically address this challenge through a modular separation of recognition and planning. In this work, we propose TrackVLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that learns the synergy between object recognition and trajectory planning. Leveraging a shared LLM backbone, we employ a language modeling head for recognition and an anchor-based diffusion model for trajectory planning. To train TrackVLA, we construct an Embodied Visual Tracking Benchmark (EVT-Bench) and collect diverse difficulty levels of recognition samples, resulting in a dataset of 1.7 million samples. Through extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world environments, TrackVLA demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalizability. It significantly outperforms existing methods on public benchmarks in a zero-shot manner while remaining robust to high dynamics and occlusion in real-world scenarios at 10 FPS inference speed.

A Benchmark and Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19510v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for their expanding applications in embodied AI, robotics, and other real-world tasks. To effectively support these applications, grounding in spatial and temporal understanding in multimodal environments is essential. To this end, recent works have leveraged scene graphs, a structured representation that encodes entities, attributes, and their relationships in a scene. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs' ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that these models fail to effectively decompose discrete scenes from a complex narrative, leading to a bottleneck when generating scene graphs. These findings underscore the need for improved methodologies in scene graph generation and provide valuable insights for future research. The demonstration of our benchmark is available at https://tsg-bench.netlify.app. Additionally, our code and evaluation data are publicly available at https://github.com/docworlds/tsg-bench.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling.

| **[Functionality understanding and segmentation in 3D scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16310v5)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

| **[Reinforced Reasoning for Embodied Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22050v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |

By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interactions, robots can improve understanding, adapt to, and execute complex tasks in dynamic real-world environments. However, embodied AI in mobile service robots continues to face key challenges, including multimodal sensor fusion, real-time decision-making under uncertainty, task generalization, and effective human-robot interactions (HRI). In this paper, we present the first systematic review of the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics, identifying key open challenges in embodied AI and examining how foundation models can address them. Namely, we explore the role of such models in enabling real-time sensor fusion, language-conditioned control, and adaptive task execution. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications in the domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation sectors, demonstrating the transformative impact of foundation models on service robotics. We also include potential future research directions, emphasizing the need for predictive scaling laws, autonomous long-term adaptation, and cross-embodiment generalization to enable scalable, efficient, and robust deployment of foundation models in human-centric robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Identity-Preserving Multi-Person Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18078v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable video generation (CVG) has advanced rapidly, yet current systems falter when more than one actor must move, interact, and exchange positions under noisy control signals. We address this gap with DanceTogether, the first end-to-end diffusion framework that turns a single reference image plus independent pose-mask streams into long, photorealistic videos while strictly preserving every identity. A novel MaskPoseAdapter binds "who" and "how" at every denoising step by fusing robust tracking masks with semantically rich-but noisy-pose heat-maps, eliminating the identity drift and appearance bleeding that plague frame-wise pipelines. To train and evaluate at scale, we introduce (i) PairFS-4K, 26 hours of dual-skater footage with 7,000+ distinct IDs, (ii) HumanRob-300, a one-hour humanoid-robot interaction set for rapid cross-domain transfer, and (iii) TogetherVideoBench, a three-track benchmark centered on the DanceTogEval-100 test suite covering dance, boxing, wrestling, yoga, and figure skating. On TogetherVideoBench, DanceTogether outperforms the prior arts by a significant margin. Moreover, we show that a one-hour fine-tune yields convincing human-robot videos, underscoring broad generalization to embodied-AI and HRI tasks. Extensive ablations confirm that persistent identity-action binding is critical to these gains. Together, our model, datasets, and benchmark lift CVG from single-subject choreography to compositionally controllable, multi-actor interaction, opening new avenues for digital production, simulation, and embodied intelligence.

To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions.

| **[Perceptual Quality Assessment for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16815v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI has developed rapidly in recent years, but it is still mainly deployed in laboratories, with various distortions in the Real-world limiting its application. Traditionally, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are applied to predict human preferences for distorted images; however, there is no IQA method to assess the usability of an image in embodied tasks, namely, the perceptual quality for robots. To provide accurate and reliable quality indicators for future embodied scenarios, we first propose the topic: IQA for Embodied AI. Specifically, we (1) based on the Mertonian system and meta-cognitive theory, constructed a perception-cognition-decision-execution pipeline and defined a comprehensive subjective score collection process; (2) established the Embodied-IQA database, containing over 36k reference/distorted image pairs, with more than 5m fine-grained annotations provided by Vision Language Models/Vision Language Action-models/Real-world robots; (3) trained and validated the performance of mainstream IQA methods on Embodied-IQA, demonstrating the need to develop more accurate quality indicators for Embodied AI. We sincerely hope that through evaluation, we can promote the application of Embodied AI under complex distortions in the Real-world.

This paper shows that VLMs can achieve surprisingly strong decision-making performance when visual scenes are represented merely as text-only descriptions, suggesting foundational reasoning can be effectively learned from language. Motivated by this insight, we propose Praxis-VLM, a reasoning VLM for vision-grounded decision-making. Praxis-VLM employs the GRPO algorithm on textual scenarios to instill robust reasoning capabilities, where models learn to evaluate actions and their consequences. These reasoning skills, acquired purely from text, successfully transfer to multimodal inference with visual inputs, significantly reducing reliance on scarce paired image-text training data. Experiments across diverse decision-making benchmarks demonstrate that Praxis-VLM substantially outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning, exhibiting superior performance and generalizability. Further analysis confirms that our models engage in explicit and effective reasoning, underpinning their enhanced performance and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

Recent success of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates that specialization of parameters enables strong scalability. In this work, we propose DriveMoE, a novel MoE-based E2E-AD framework, with a Scene-Specialized Vision MoE and a Skill-Specialized Action MoE. DriveMoE is built upon our $\pi_0$ Vision-Language-Action (VLA) baseline (originally from the embodied AI field), called Drive-$\pi_0$. Specifically, we add Vision MoE to Drive-$\pi_0$ by training a router to select relevant cameras according to the driving context dynamically. This design mirrors human driving cognition, where drivers selectively attend to crucial visual cues rather than exhaustively processing all visual information. In addition, we add Action MoE by training another router to activate specialized expert modules for different driving behaviors. Through explicit behavioral specialization, DriveMoE is able to handle diverse scenarios without suffering from modes averaging like existing models. In Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation experiments, DriveMoE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining vision and action MoE in autonomous driving tasks. We will release our code and models of DriveMoE and Drive-$\pi_0$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://thinklab-sjtu.github.io/DriveMoE/</p></details> |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

However, current co-speech gesture generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (\textit{e.g.} speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Intentional-Gesture}, a novel framework that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in high-level communicative functions. % First, we curate the \textbf{InG} dataset by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (\textit{i.e.}, text sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the \textbf{Intentional Gesture Motion Tokenizer} to leverage these intention annotations. It injects high-level communicative functions (\textit{e.g.}, intentions) into tokenized motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Omnidirectional Reasoning with 360-R1: A Dataset, Benchmark, and GRPO-based Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14197v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnidirectional images (ODIs), with their 360{\deg} field of view, provide unparalleled spatial awareness for immersive applications like augmented reality and embodied AI. However, the capability of existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend and reason about such panoramic scenes remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing OmniVQA, the first dataset and conducting the first benchmark for omnidirectional visual question answering. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant limitations in handling omnidirectional visual question answering, highlighting persistent challenges in object localization, feature extraction, and hallucination suppression within panoramic contexts. These results underscore the disconnect between current MLLM capabilities and the demands of omnidirectional visual understanding, which calls for dedicated architectural or training innovations tailored to 360{\deg} imagery. Building on the OmniVQA dataset and benchmark, we further introduce a rule-based reinforcement learning method, 360-R1, based on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct. Concretely, we modify the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by proposing three novel reward functions: (1) reasoning process similarity reward, (2) answer semantic accuracy reward, and (3) structured format compliance reward. Extensive experiments on our OmniVQA demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in omnidirectional space (+6% improvement).</p></details> |  |

The emerging new factor in this trend is morphological evolution, the evolution of physical forms within embodied AI systems such as robots. In this study, we investigate a system of hexacopter-type drones with evolvable morphologies and learnable controllers and make contributions to two fields. For aerial robotics, we demonstrate that the combination of evolution and learning can deliver non-conventional drones that significantly outperform the traditional hexacopter on several tasks that are more complex than previously considered in the literature. For the field of Evolutionary Computing, we introduce novel metrics and perform new analyses into the interaction of morphological evolution and learning, uncovering hitherto unidentified effects. Our analysis tools are domain-agnostic, making a methodological contribution towards building solid foundations for embodied AI systems that integrate evolution and learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 figures, currently under review</p></details> |

Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code are be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</p></details> |  |

Yet progress has been limited by the absence of large-scale, real-time, multi-modal, and socially interactive datasets that reflect the sensory-motor complexity of natural environments. To address this, we present PLAICraft, a novel data collection platform and dataset capturing multiplayer Minecraft interactions across five time-aligned modalities: video, game output audio, microphone input audio, mouse, and keyboard actions. Each modality is logged with millisecond time precision, enabling the study of synchronous, embodied behaviour in a rich, open-ended world. The dataset comprises over 10,000 hours of gameplay from more than 10,000 global participants.\footnote{We have done a privacy review for the public release of an initial 200-hour subset of the dataset, with plans to release most of the dataset over time.} Alongside the dataset, we provide an evaluation suite for benchmarking model capabilities in object recognition, spatial awareness, language grounding, and long-term memory. PLAICraft opens a path toward training and evaluating agents that act fluently and purposefully in real time, paving the way for truly embodied artificial intelligence.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

Building on these developments, text-to-video diffusion models have evolved into embodied world models (EWMs) capable of generating physically plausible scenes from language commands, effectively bridging vision and action in embodied AI applications. This work addresses the critical challenge of evaluating EWMs beyond general perceptual metrics to ensure the generation of physically grounded and action-consistent behaviors. We propose the Embodied World Model Benchmark (EWMBench), a dedicated framework designed to evaluate EWMs based on three key aspects: visual scene consistency, motion correctness, and semantic alignment. Our approach leverages a meticulously curated dataset encompassing diverse scenes and motion patterns, alongside a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation toolkit, to assess and compare candidate models. The proposed benchmark not only identifies the limitations of existing video generation models in meeting the unique requirements of embodied tasks but also provides valuable insights to guide future advancements in the field.

| **[Emergent Active Perception and Dexterity of Simulated Humanoids from Visual Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12278v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human behavior is fundamentally shaped by visual perception -- our ability to interact with the world depends on actively gathering relevant information and adapting our movements accordingly. Behaviors like searching for objects, reaching, and hand-eye coordination naturally emerge from the structure of our sensory system. Inspired by these principles, we introduce Perceptive Dexterous Control (PDC), a framework for vision-driven dexterous whole-body control with simulated humanoids. PDC operates solely on egocentric vision for task specification, enabling object search, target placement, and skill selection through visual cues, without relying on privileged state information (e.g., 3D object positions and geometries). This perception-as-interface paradigm enables learning a single policy to perform multiple household tasks, including reaching, grasping, placing, and articulated object manipulation. We also show that training from scratch with reinforcement learning can produce emergent behaviors such as active search. These results demonstrate how vision-driven control and complex tasks induce human-like behaviors and can serve as the key ingredients in closing the perception-action loop for animation, robotics, and embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zhengyiluo.github.io/PDC</p></details> |
| **[Are Multimodal Large Language Models Ready for Omnidirectional Spatial Reasoning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11907v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 180x360 omnidirectional field of view captured by 360-degree cameras enables their use in a wide range of applications such as embodied AI and virtual reality. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in visual-spatial reasoning, most studies focus on standard pinhole-view images, leaving omnidirectional perception largely unexplored. In this paper, we ask: Are MLLMs ready for omnidirectional spatial reasoning? To investigate this, we introduce OSR-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed for this setting. OSR-Bench includes over 153,000 diverse question-answer pairs grounded in high-fidelity panoramic indoor scene maps. It covers key reasoning types including object counting, relative distance, and direction. We also propose a negative sampling strategy that inserts non-existent objects into prompts to evaluate hallucination and grounding robustness. For fine-grained analysis, we design a two-stage evaluation framework assessing both cognitive map generation and QA accuracy using rotation-invariant matching and a combination of rule-based and LLM-based metrics. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and leading open-source models under zero-shot settings. Results show that current models struggle with spatial reasoning in panoramic contexts, highlighting the need for more perceptually grounded MLLMs. OSR-Bench and code will be released at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/UUUserna/OSR-Bench</p></details> |  |

These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: Foundation Models (FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas Federated Learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied environments. In this vision paper, we introduce Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed nature of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical deployment dimensions of FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning, Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for deploying FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In this chapter we put this work in the context of "Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence" (GOFAI) (Haugeland, 1989) and the behavior-based or embodied alternatives (R. A. Brooks 1991; Pfeifer and Scheier 2001). We claim that the AI-powered robots are only weakly embodied and inherit some of the problems of GOFAI. Moreover, we review and critically discuss the possibility of cross-embodiment learning (Padalkar et al. 2024). We identify fundamental roadblocks and propose directions on how to make progress.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

However, the proliferation of vendor-specific proprietary communication libraries creates significant interoperability barriers, hindering seamless collaboration between different accelerator types and leading to suboptimal resource utilization and performance bottlenecks in distributed AI workloads. This paper introduces KAITIAN, a novel distributed communication framework designed to bridge this gap. KAITIAN provides a unified abstraction layer that intelligently integrates vendor-optimized communication libraries for intra-group efficiency with general-purpose communication protocols for inter-group interoperability. Crucially, it incorporates a load-adaptive scheduling mechanism that dynamically balances computational tasks across heterogeneous devices based on their real-time performance characteristics. Implemented as an extension to PyTorch and rigorously evaluated on a testbed featuring NVIDIA GPUs and Cambricon MLUs, KAITIAN demonstrates significant improvements in resource utilization and scalability for distributed training tasks. Experimental results show that KAITIAN can accelerate training time by up to 42% compared to baseline homogeneous systems, while incurring minimal communication overhead (2.8--4.3%) and maintaining model accuracy. KAITIAN paves the way for more flexible and powerful heterogeneous computing in complex embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

| **[One Token to Fool LLM-as-a-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08794v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task, we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step." can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We release our robust, general-domain reward model and its synthetic training data at https://huggingface.co/sarosavo/Master-RM and https://huggingface.co/datasets/sarosavo/Master-RM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimistic Exploration for Risk-Averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08793v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or, in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic (ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment CityLearn.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning-aided Bigraph Matching Approach to Multi-Crew Restoration of Damaged Power Networks Coupled with Road Transportation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19703v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions, such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained. Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes, depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power restored.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in proceedings of ASME IDETC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Penalizing Infeasible Actions and Reward Scaling in Reinforcement Learning with Offline Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08761v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization (RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML2025 |

We present a framework automating algorithm discovery by conceptualizing them as sequences of operations, represented as tokens. These computational tokens are chained using a grammar, enabling the formation of increasingly sophisticated procedures. Our ensemble Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) guided by reinforcement learning (RL) explores token chaining and drives the creation of new tokens. This methodology rediscovers, improves, and generates new algorithms that substantially outperform existing methods for strongly NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems and foundational quantum computing approaches such as Grover's and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Operating at the computational rather than code-generation level, our framework produces algorithms that can be tailored specifically to problem instances, not merely classes.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[On the Effect of Regularization in Policy Mirror Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08718v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.</p></details> | Accepted at RLC |

Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08707v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation, and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward learning from suboptimal demonstrations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-critic Learning for Whole-body End-effector Twist Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08656v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning whole-body control for locomotion and arm motions in a single policy has challenges, as the two tasks have conflicting goals. For instance, efficient locomotion typically favors a horizontal base orientation, while end-effector tracking may benefit from base tilting to extend reachability. Additionally, current Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches using a pose-based task specification lack the ability to directly control the end-effector velocity, making smoothly executing trajectories very challenging. To address these limitations, we propose an RL-based framework that allows for dynamic, velocity-aware whole-body end-effector control. Our method introduces a multi-critic actor architecture that decouples the reward signals for locomotion and manipulation, simplifying reward tuning and allowing the policy to resolve task conflicts more effectively. Furthermore, we design a twist-based end-effector task formulation that can track both discrete poses and motion trajectories. We validate our approach through a set of simulation and hardware experiments using a quadruped robot equipped with a robotic arm. The resulting controller can simultaneously walk and move its end-effector and shows emergent whole-body behaviors, where the base assists the arm in extending the workspace, despite a lack of explicit formulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resource Allocation with Peak Age of Information Violation Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08653v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs), control and communication systems must be co-designed due to their strong interdependence. This paper presents a novel optimization theory-based safe deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for ultra-reliable WNCSs, ensuring constraint satisfaction while optimizing performance, for the first time in the literature. The approach minimizes power consumption under key constraints, including Peak Age of Information (PAoI) violation probability, transmit power, and schedulability in the finite blocklength regime. PAoI violation probability is uniquely derived by combining stochastic maximum allowable transfer interval (MATI) and maximum allowable packet delay (MAD) constraints in a multi-sensor network. The framework consists of two stages: optimization theory and safe DRL. The first stage derives optimality conditions to establish mathematical relationships among variables, simplifying and decomposing the problem. The second stage employs a safe DRL model where a teacher-student framework guides the DRL agent (student). The control mechanism (teacher) evaluates compliance with system constraints and suggests the nearest feasible action when needed. Extensive simulations show that the proposed framework outperforms rule-based and other optimization theory based DRL benchmarks, achieving faster convergence, higher rewards, and greater stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 Pa...</summary><p>15 Pages, to be published in IEEE Transactions on Communications</p></details> |

Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially, verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors, allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions, together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by 3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set.

Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the 'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the 'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the $44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the 'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii) a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.</p></details> |  |

The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank, enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions, and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2 that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules for memory control in visual object tracking.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations, such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio.

| **[Occlusion-Guided Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation for Occluded Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08520v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts, applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR), which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues. Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

One major limitation of most existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time, posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2) KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with 0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version, v3, added the missing name of x-axis in the left part of Fig.1 and corrected a wrong number in Fig.3.

| **[Balancing Progress and Safety: A Novel Risk-Aware Objective for RL in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06737v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising approach for achieving autonomous driving due to robust decision-making capabilities. RL learns a driving policy through trial and error in traffic scenarios, guided by a reward function that combines the driving objectives. The design of such reward function has received insufficient attention, yielding ill-defined rewards with various pitfalls. Safety, in particular, has long been regarded only as a penalty for collisions. This leaves the risks associated with actions leading up to a collision unaddressed, limiting the applicability of RL in real-world scenarios. To address these shortcomings, our work focuses on enhancing the reward formulation by defining a set of driving objectives and structuring them hierarchically. Furthermore, we discuss the formulation of these objectives in a normalized manner to transparently determine their contribution to the overall reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel risk-aware objective for various driving interactions based on a two-dimensional ellipsoid function and an extension of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) concepts. We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed reward in unsignalized intersection scenarios with varying traffic densities. The approach decreases collision rates by 21\% on average compared to baseline rewards and consistently surpasses them in route progress and cumulative reward, demonstrating its capability to promote safer driving behaviors while maintaining high-performance levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Curriculum Learning for Driving Scenarios: Towards Robust and Efficient Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08264v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges of training end-to-end autonomous driving agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL agents are typically trained in a fixed set of scenarios and nominal behavior of surrounding road users in simulations, limiting their generalization and real-life deployment. While domain randomization offers a potential solution by randomly sampling driving scenarios, it frequently results in inefficient training and sub-optimal policies due to the high variance among training scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an automatic curriculum learning framework that dynamically generates driving scenarios with adaptive complexity based on the agent's evolving capabilities. Unlike manually designed curricula that introduce expert bias and lack scalability, our framework incorporates a ``teacher'' that automatically generates and mutates driving scenarios based on their learning potential -- an agent-centric metric derived from the agent's current policy -- eliminating the need for expert design. The framework enhances training efficiency by excluding scenarios the agent has mastered or finds too challenging. We evaluate our framework in a reinforcement learning setting where the agent learns a driving policy from camera images. Comparative results against baseline methods, including fixed scenario training and domain randomization, demonstrate that our approach leads to enhanced generalization, achieving higher success rates: +9% in low traffic density, +21% in high traffic density, and faster convergence with fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the potential of ACL in improving the robustness and efficiency of RL-based autonomous driving agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |

However, the limited energy capacity of UAVs remains a significant challenge. In this case, laser beam directors (LBDs) have emerged as an effective technology for wireless charging of UAVs during operation, thereby enabling sustained data collection without frequent returns to charging stations (CSs). In this work, we investigate the age of information (AoI) optimization in LBD-powered UAV-assisted IoT networks, where multiple UAVs collect data from distributed IoTs while being recharged by laser beams. We formulate a joint optimization problem that aims to minimize the peak AoI while determining optimal UAV trajectories and laser charging strategies. This problem is particularly challenging due to its non-convex nature, complex temporal dependencies, and the need to balance data collection efficiency with energy consumption constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-agent proximal policy optimization with temporal memory and multi-agent coordination (MAPPO-TM) framework. Specifically, MAPPO-TM incorporates temporal memory mechanisms to capture the dynamic nature of UAV operations and facilitates effective coordination among multiple UAVs through decentralized learning while considering global system objectives. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MAPPO-TM algorithm outperforms conventional approaches in terms of peak AoI minimization and energy efficiency. Ideally, the proposed algorithm achieves up to 15.1% reduction in peak AoI compared to conventional multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) methods.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[GTR: Guided Thought Reinforcement Prevents Thought Collapse in RL-based VLM Agent Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08525v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable outcome rewards (RLVR) has effectively scaled up chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its efficacy in training vision-language model (VLM) agents for goal-directed action reasoning in visual environments is less established. This work investigates this problem through extensive experiments on complex card games, such as 24 points, and embodied tasks from ALFWorld. We find that when rewards are based solely on action outcomes, RL fails to incentivize CoT reasoning in VLMs, instead leading to a phenomenon we termed thought collapse, characterized by a rapid loss of diversity in the agent's thoughts, state-irrelevant and incomplete reasoning, and subsequent invalid actions, resulting in negative rewards. To counteract thought collapse, we highlight the necessity of process guidance and propose an automated corrector that evaluates and refines the agent's reasoning at each RL step. This simple and scalable GTR (Guided Thought Reinforcement) framework trains reasoning and action simultaneously without the need for dense, per-step human labeling. Our experiments demonstrate that GTR significantly enhances the performance and generalization of the LLaVA-7b model across various visual environments, achieving 3-5 times higher task success rates compared to SoTA models with notably smaller model sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase, Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 camera-ready</p></details> |

Reaction wheels (RWs) play a pivotal role in attitude control, and maintaining control resilience during RW faults is critical to preserving mission objectives and system stability. However, traditional Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall short in providing the real time adaptability and fault tolerance required for autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based control strategy designed to improve satellite resilience and adaptability under fault conditions. Specifically, the proposed method integrates Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) referred to as TD3-HD to enhance learning in sparse reward environments and maintain satellite stability during RW failures. The proposed approach is benchmarked against PD control and leading DRL algorithms. Experimental results show that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability under fault conditions. These findings underscore the proposed method potential as a powerful, fault tolerant, onboard AI solution for autonomous satellite attitude control.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the widespread use of switchback experiments in A/B testing, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of various switchback designs in Markovian environments. Unlike many existing works which derive the optimal design based on specific and relatively simple estimators, our analysis covers a range of state-of-the-art estimators developed in the reinforcement learning (RL) literature. It reveals that the effectiveness of different switchback designs depends crucially on (i) the size of the carryover effect and (ii) the auto-correlations among reward errors over time. Meanwhile, these findings are estimator-agnostic, i.e., they apply to most RL estimators. Based on these insights, we provide a workflow to offer guidelines for practitioners on designing switchback experiments in A/B testing.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical gap persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks, showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.</p></details> | 31pages, 14 figures |

However, reinforcement learning-based motion policies often suffer from robustness degradation due to the sim-to-real dynamics gap, thereby affecting the agility of real robots. In this work, we propose a novel robust adversarial training paradigm designed to enhance the robustness of humanoid motion policies in real worlds. The paradigm introduces a learnable adversarial attack network that precisely identifies vulnerabilities in motion policies and applies targeted perturbations, forcing the motion policy to enhance its robustness against perturbations through dynamic adversarial training. We conduct experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot for both perceptive locomotion and whole-body control tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances the robot's motion robustness in real world environments, enabling successful traversal of challenging terrains and highly agile whole-body trajectory tracking.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost. Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting. Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately 30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributional Soft Actor-Critic with Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01381v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D (Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all 9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total average return improvement of over 10% compared to existing mainstream algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |

This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples. These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse, high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs) to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Safety Alignment via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08270v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents, enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary, not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically efficient.

However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for multi-step reasoning processes. Specifically, sparse reward signals fail to deliver effective or sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such reward structures induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across ipntermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a novel method designed to both deliver dense rewards and amplify explorations in the RL-based training paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three key innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; dynamic reward scaling to stabilize exploration and exploitation in large action spaces; and advantage-preserving reward implementation that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across three public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness with a 22.39% improvement on the difficult dataset Countdown-4.</p></details> |  |

This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity connections across frames. We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models to discriminate between coherent image sequences and stories from unrelated images. We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to teach appropriate entity connection behavior. We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic contexts. Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on Qwen2.5-VL 7B). Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1 from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%). Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except "its", and cross-frame character and object persistence increased across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%). Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story, increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).</p></details> | 7 pages |

From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence (the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration. The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

A notable milestone was the development of Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which achieved human-level performance across a range of Atari games, demonstrating the potential of deep learning to stabilise and scale reinforcement learning. Subsequently, extensions to continuous control algorithms paved the way for a new paradigm in control, one that has attracted broader attention than any classical control approach in recent literature. These developments also demonstrated strong potential for advancing data-driven, model-free algorithms for control and for achieving higher levels of autonomy. However, the application of these methods has remained largely confined to simulated and gaming environments, with ongoing efforts to extend them to real-world applications. Before such deployment can be realised, a solid and quantitative understanding of their performance on applied control problems is necessary. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of these approaches on four diverse benchmark problems with implementation results. This analysis offers a scrutinising and systematic evaluation to shed light on the real-world capabilities and limitations of deep reinforcement learning methods in applied control settings.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM. Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages |

In the reinforcement learning (RL) context, a variety of algorithms have been developed to learn and optimize these MDPs. At the heart of many popular policy-gradient based learning algorithms, such as natural actor-critic, TRPO, and PPO, lies the Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) policy optimization algorithm. Convergence results for these RL algorithms rest on convergence results for the NPG algorithm. However, all existing results on the convergence of the NPG algorithm are limited to finite-state settings. We study a general class of queueing MDPs, and prove a $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for the NPG algorithm, if the NPG algorithm is initialized with the MaxWeight policy. This is the first convergence rate bound for the NPG algorithm for a general class of infinite-state average-reward MDPs. Moreover, our result applies to a beyond the queueing setting to any countably-infinite MDP satisfying certain mild structural assumptions, given a sufficiently good initial policy. Key to our result are state-dependent bounds on the relative value function achieved by the iterate policies of the NPG algorithm.</p></details> | 32 pages |

However, no benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control, TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60% accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR (Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning, enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded reasoning.

In contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality. KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more. Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs. out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at: https://github.com/ShivamDuggal4/karl Keywords: Representation Learning, Adaptive Tokenization, Compression, Algorithmic Information Theory, Kolmogorov Complexity, Upside-Down RL</p></details> |
| **[EXPO: Stable Reinforcement Learning with Expressive Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07986v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution. The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning with Action Chunking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07969v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1) leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Scaling RL to Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07966v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models are available at https://github.com/NVlabs/Long-RL</p></details> |

We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1 rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios. Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning models.

When ML methods are responsible for making critical decisions, stakeholders often require insights into how to alter these decisions. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) have emerged as a solution, offering interpretations of opaque ML models and providing a pathway to transition from one decision to another. However, most existing CFE methods require access to the model's training dataset, few methods can handle multivariate time-series, and none of model-agnostic CFE methods can handle multivariate time-series without training datasets. These limitations can be formidable in many scenarios. In this paper, we present NTD-CFE, a novel model-agnostic CFE method based on reinforcement learning (RL) that generates CFEs when training datasets are unavailable. NTD-CFE is suitable for both static and multivariate time-series datasets with continuous and discrete features. NTD-CFE reduces the CFE search space from a multivariate time-series domain to a lower dimensional space and addresses the problem using RL. Users have the flexibility to specify non-actionable, immutable, and preferred features, as well as causal constraints. We demonstrate the performance of NTD-CFE against four baselines on several datasets and find that, despite not having access to a training dataset, NTD-CFE finds CFEs that make significantly fewer and significantly smaller changes to the input time-series. These properties make CFEs more actionable, as the magnitude of change required to alter an outcome is vastly reduced.

We leverage deep reinforcement learning to train a single locomotion policy on procedurally generated robots. The policy maps proprioceptive robot state information and base velocity commands into desired joint actuation targets, which are conditioned using a latent embedding of the temporally local system dynamics. We explore two conditioning strategies - one using a GRU-based dynamics encoder and another using a morphology-based property estimator - and show that morphology-aware conditioning outperforms temporal dynamics encoding regarding velocity task tracking for our hardware test on ANYmal C. Our results demonstrate that both approaches achieve robust zero-shot transfer across multiple unseen simulated quadrupeds. Furthermore, we demonstrate the need for careful robot reference modelling during training: exposing the policy to a diverse set of robot morphologies and dynamics leads to improved generalization, reducing the velocity tracking error by up to 30% compared to the baseline method. Despite PAL not surpassing the best-performing reference-free controller in all cases, our analysis uncovers critical design choices and informs improvements to the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **["So, Tell Me About Your Policy...": Distillation of interpretable policies from Deep Reinforcement Learning agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07848v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings, it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm, although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful information from complex expert policies.</p></details> |  |

While post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have achieved notable success, they often introduce computational inefficiencies and training instability. In this paper, we propose Feature-level constrained Preference Optimization (FPO), a novel method designed to simplify the alignment process while ensuring stability. FPO leverages pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduces feature-level constraints, allowing for efficient, sparsity-enforced alignment. Our approach enjoys efficiency by using sparse features activated in a well-trained sparse autoencoder and the quality of sequential KL divergence by using the feature-level offline reference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FPO achieves a 5.08% absolute improvement in win rate with much lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines, making it a promising solution for efficient and controllable LLM alignments.</p></details> |  |

Such a problem is non-trivial, posing three major challenges in quadruped locomotion control. First, how to model or represent the dynamics of the load in a generic manner. Second, how to make the robot capture the dynamics without any external sensing. Third, how to enable the robot to interact with load handling the mutual effect and stabilizing the load. In this work, we propose a general load modeling approach called load characteristics modeling to capture the dynamics of the load. We integrate this proposed modeling technique and leverage recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) based locomotion control to enable the robot to infer the dynamics of load movement and interact with the load indirectly to stabilize it and realize the sim-to-real deployment to verify its effectiveness in real scenarios. We conduct extensive comparative simulation experiments to validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

While individual success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment, multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments, and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy learning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Workshop on Computational Optimization of Buildings (ICML CO-BUILD), 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025), Vancouver, Canada</p></details> |

Despite its empirical success, the theoretical properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work, we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs, while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and interpretable language model alignment.</p></details> |  |

Traditional scaling approaches typically rely on static thresholds and predefined rules, which are often inadequate for optimizing resource utilization and maintaining performance in distributed and dynamic environments. This inefficiency hinders the adaptability and performance required in edge-cloud infrastructures, which can only be achieved through the newly proposed in-place scaling. To address this problem, we propose the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based In-place Scaling Engine (MARLISE) that enables seamless, dynamic, reactive control with in-place resource scaling. We develop our solution using two Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms: Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We analyze each version of the proposed MARLISE solution using dynamic workloads, demonstrating their ability to ensure low response times of microservices and scalability. Our results show that MARLISE-based approaches outperform heuristic method in managing resource elasticity while maintaining microservice response times and achieving higher resource efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Cloud 2025</p></details> |

While these modifications are specific to RL, they are not universally applicable across all RL algorithms. Therefore, we aim to assess their impact on performance and explore other SSL objectives that do not accommodate these adjustments like Barlow Twins and VICReg. We evaluate six SPR variants on the Atari 100k benchmark, including versions both with and without these modifications. Additionally, we test the performance of these objectives on the DeepMind Control Suite, where such modifications are absent. Our findings reveal that incorporating specific SSL modifications within SPR significantly enhances performance, and this influence extends to subsequent frameworks like SR-SPR and BBF, highlighting the critical importance of SSL objective selection and related adaptations in achieving data efficiency in self-predictive reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>RLC 2...</summary><p>RLC 2025, Neurips SSL Workshop 2024</p></details> |

As a result, expectations are rising for the automation of tasks such as material transport and exploration in unknown environments. However, autonomous locomotion in rough terrains with significant height variations requires vertical movement, and robots capable of performing such movements stably, along with their control methods, have not yet been fully established. In this study, we developed the quadruped robot KLEIYN, which features a waist joint, and aimed to expand quadruped locomotion by enabling chimney climbing through RL. To facilitate the learning of vertical motion, we introduced Contact-Guided Curriculum Learning (CGCL). As a result, KLEIYN successfully climbed walls ranging from 800 mm to 1000 mm in width at an average speed of 150 mm/s, 50 times faster than conventional robots. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the introduction of a waist joint improves climbing performance, particularly enhancing tracking ability on narrow walls.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS2025, website - https://keitayoneda.github.io/kleiyn-chimney-climbing/, YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLfUhyNFOeY</p></details> |
| **[Offline Trajectory Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10393v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies without online explorations. To enlarge the training data, model-based offline RL learns a dynamics model which is utilized as a virtual environment to generate simulation data and enhance policy learning. However, existing data augmentation methods for offline RL suffer from (i) trivial improvement from short-horizon simulation; and (ii) the lack of evaluation and correction for generated data, leading to low-qualified augmentation. In this paper, we propose offline trajectory optimization for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). The key motivation is to conduct long-horizon simulation and then utilize model uncertainty to evaluate and correct the augmented data. Specifically, we propose an ensemble of Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict environment state dynamics and the reward function. Three strategies are proposed to use World Transformers to generate long-horizon trajectory simulation by perturbing the actions in the offline data. Then, an uncertainty-based World Evaluator is introduced to firstly evaluate the confidence of the generated trajectories and then perform the correction for low-confidence data. Finally, we jointly use the original data with the corrected augmentation data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing model-free offline RL methods. Experiments on various benchmarks show that OTTO can effectively improve the performance of representative offline RL algorithms, including in complex environments with sparse rewards like AntMaze.

While these methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT. Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.</p></details> |  |

A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases, resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17 benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.</p></details> |  |

However, leveraging such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii) fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$ performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.</p></details> | 15 Pages |

However, the high computational demands often exceed a single UAV's capacity, making it difficult to continuously provide stable high-level services. To address this, this paper proposes a cooperation framework involving UAVs, GERs, and airships. The framework enables resource pooling through UAV-to-GER (U2G) and UAV-to-airship (U2A) links, offering computing services for offloaded tasks. Specifically, we formulate the multi-objective problem of task assignment and exploration as a dynamic long-term optimization problem aiming to minimize task completion time and energy use while ensuring stability. Using Lyapunov optimization, we transform it into a per-slot deterministic problem and propose HG-MADDPG, which combines the Hungarian algorithm with a GDM-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient. Simulations demonstrate significant improvements in offloading efficiency, latency, and system stability over baselines.</p></details> |  |

While previous work has explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit: empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms, particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy.

We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration, focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model, RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%, on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our code, datasets, and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/Kwai-Klear/RLEP to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Kwai-Klear/RLEP</p></details> |
| **[ARBoids: Adaptive Residual Reinforcement Learning With Boids Model for Cooperative Multi-USV Target Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18549v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The target defense problem (TDP) for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) concerns intercepting an adversarial USV before it breaches a designated target region, using one or more defending USVs. A particularly challenging scenario arises when the attacker exhibits superior maneuverability compared to the defenders, significantly complicating effective interception. To tackle this challenge, this letter introduces ARBoids, a novel adaptive residual reinforcement learning framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the biologically inspired, force-based Boids model. Within this framework, the Boids model serves as a computationally efficient baseline policy for multi-agent coordination, while DRL learns a residual policy to adaptively refine and optimize the defenders' actions. The proposed approach is validated in a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation environment, demonstrating superior performance over traditional interception strategies, including pure force-based approaches and vanilla DRL policies. Furthermore, the learned policy exhibits strong adaptability to attackers with diverse maneuverability profiles, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability. The code of ARBoids will be released upon acceptance of this letter.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMER-Ranker: Learning to Rank Emotion Descriptions in the Absence of Ground Truth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04278v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs), Descriptive Multimodal Emotion Recognition (DMER) has garnered increasing attention, which aims to describe a person's emotional state using free-form natural language. Unlike traditional discriminative methods that rely on predefined emotion taxonomies, DMER offers greater flexibility in emotional expression, enabling fine-grained and interpretable emotion representations. However, this free-form prediction paradigm exposes significant challenges in evaluation. Existing methods either depend on ground-truth descriptions that require substantial manual annotations or simplify the task by shifting the focus from evaluating descriptions to evaluating emotion labels. However, this simplification overlooks critical aspects such as emotional temporal dynamics, intensity, and uncertainty. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and propose DMER-Ranker, a novel evaluation strategy that reformulates the traditional ``prediction-ground truth'' comparison into the ``prediction-prediction'' comparison, eliminating the need for ground-truth descriptions. We then employ the Bradley-Terry algorithm to convert pairwise comparison results into model-level rankings. Additionally, we explore the possibility of automatic preference prediction and introduce DMER-Preference, the first preference dataset specifically designed for human emotions. Our work advances the field of DMER and lays the foundation for more intelligent human-computer interaction systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Verification for LLM Code Generation: From Generation to Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06920v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method (SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability, aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc) of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78% higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis and adaptive benchmark integration.</p></details> |  |

However, dynamic and unknown environments pose significant challenges due to target unpredictability and environmental uncertainty. To tackle these issues, we propose PILOC, a framework that operates without global prior knowledge, leveraging local perception and communication. It introduces a pheromone inverse guidance mechanism to enable efficient coordination and dynamic target localization. PILOC promotes decentralized cooperation through local communication, significantly reducing reliance on global channels. Unlike conventional heuristics, the pheromone mechanism is embedded into the observation space of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), supporting indirect agent coordination based on environmental cues. We further integrate this strategy into a DRL-based multi-agent architecture and conduct extensive experiments. Results show that combining local communication with pheromone-based guidance significantly boosts search efficiency, adaptability, and system robustness. Compared to existing methods, PILOC performs better under dynamic and communication-constrained scenarios, offering promising directions for future MASAR applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bradley-Terry and Multi-Objective Reward Modeling Are Complementary](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07375v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring performance of reward models.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTA1: GUI Test-time Scaling Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05791v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms (e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements. Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step. However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning (i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual targets. This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning (RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments, rewarding successful clicks on interface elements. Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7% accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Context Generalization in Reinforcement Learning from Few Training Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07348v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes (CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its potential to improve generalization in DRL.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, submitted to Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[MarineFormer: A Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for USV Navigation in Dynamic Marine Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13973v4)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous navigation in marine environments can be extremely challenging, especially in the presence of spatially varying flow disturbances and dynamic and static obstacles. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating local flow field measurements fundamentally alters the nature of the problem, transforming otherwise unsolvable navigation scenarios into tractable ones. However, the mere availability of flow data is not sufficient; it must be effectively fused with conventional sensory inputs such as ego-state and obstacle states. To this end, we propose \textbf{MarineFormer}, a Transformer-based policy architecture that integrates two complementary attention mechanisms: spatial attention for sensor fusion, and temporal attention for capturing environmental dynamics. MarineFormer is trained end-to-end via reinforcement learning in a 2D simulated environment with realistic flow features and obstacles. Extensive evaluations against classical and state-of-the-art baselines show that our approach improves episode completion success rate by nearly 23\% while reducing path length. Ablation studies further highlight the critical role of flow measurements and the effectiveness of our proposed architecture in leveraging them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Model Splitting and Device Task Assignment for Deceptive Signal Assisted Private Multi-hop Split Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07323v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Communication and Device Clustering for Clustered Federated Learning with Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07320v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs) with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20% and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.</p></details> |  |

There are several approaches to efficiently explore an environment to learn to solve tasks by multi-agent operating in that environment, of which, the idea of expert exploration is investigated in this work. More specifically, this work investigates the application of large-language models as expert planners for efficient exploration in planning based tasks for multiple agents.</p></details> |  |

This enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models, and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies, including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular, interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning, and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Pre-Trained Models for Enhanced Feature Representation in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07197v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA), a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number of models influences agents' performance during and after training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at 4th Conference on Lifelong Learning Agents (CoLLAs), 2025</p></details> |

While curriculum learning has demonstrated success in single-agent domains, principled approaches for multi-agent coordination remain limited due to the absence of validated task complexity metrics. This approach presents a graph-based coordination complexity metric that integrates agent dependency entropy, spatial interference patterns, and goal overlap analysis to predict task difficulty in multi-agent environments. The complexity metric achieves strong empirical validation with rho = 0.952 correlation (p < 0.001) between predicted complexity and empirical difficulty determined by random agent performance evaluation. This approach evaluates the curriculum learning framework using MADDPG across two distinct coordination environments: achieving 56x performance improvement in tight coordination tasks (MultiWalker) and demonstrating systematic task progression in cooperative navigation (Simple Spread). Through systematic analysis, coordination tightness emerges as a predictor of curriculum learning effectiveness, where environments requiring strict agent interdependence benefit substantially from structured progression. This approach provides a validated complexity metric for multi-agent curriculum design and establishes empirical guidelines for multi-robot coordination applications.</p></details> | 6 Pages, 3 Figures |

We propose FR3E (First Return, Entropy-Eliciting Explore), a structured exploration framework that identifies high-uncertainty decision points in reasoning trajectories and performs targeted rollouts to construct semantically grounded intermediate feedback. Our method provides targeted guidance without relying on dense supervision. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks(AIME24) show that FR3E promotes more stable training, produces longer and more coherent responses, and increases the proportion of fully correct trajectories. These results highlight the framework's effectiveness in improving LLM reasoning through more robust and structured exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Learning-based MARL for Strengthening Physical-Layer Security in B5G Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06997v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the application of a federated learning-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) strategy to enhance physical-layer security (PLS) in a multi-cellular network within the context of beyond 5G networks. At each cell, a base station (BS) operates as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent that interacts with the surrounding environment to maximize the secrecy rate of legitimate users in the presence of an eavesdropper. This eavesdropper attempts to intercept the confidential information shared between the BS and its authorized users. The DRL agents are deemed to be federated since they only share their network parameters with a central server and not the private data of their legitimate users. Two DRL approaches, deep Q-network (DQN) and Reinforce deep policy gradient (RDPG), are explored and compared. The results demonstrate that RDPG converges more rapidly than DQN. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the distributed DRL approach. Furthermore, the outcomes illustrate the trade-off between security and complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Cognitive Networks: Reinforcement Learning Meets Energy Harvesting Over Cascaded Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06981v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to improve the physical layer security (PLS) of an underlay cognitive radio network (CRN) over cascaded channels. These channels are utilized in highly mobile networks such as cognitive vehicular networks (CVN). In addition, an eavesdropper aims to intercept the communications between secondary users (SUs). The SU receiver has full-duplex and energy harvesting capabilities to generate jamming signals to confound the eavesdropper and enhance security. Moreover, the SU transmitter extracts energy from ambient radio frequency signals in order to power subsequent transmissions to its intended receiver. To optimize the privacy and reliability of the SUs in a CVN, a deep Q-network (DQN) strategy is utilized where multiple DQN agents are required such that an agent is assigned at each SU transmitter. The objective for the SUs is to determine the optimal transmission power and decide whether to collect energy or transmit messages during each time period in order to maximize their secrecy rate. Thereafter, we propose a DQN approach to maximize the throughput of the SUs while respecting the interference threshold acceptable at the receiver of the primary user. According to our findings, our strategy outperforms two other baseline strategies in terms of security and reliability.</p></details> |  |

However, IPP is often applied in scenarios where anomalies, such as plant diseases, pollution, or hurricane damage, appear in clusters. In such cases, prioritizing the exploration of anomalous regions over uniform coverage is beneficial. This work introduces a class of algorithms referred to as bounom\=odes ("as the ox grazes"), which alternates between uniform boustrophedon sampling and targeted exploration of detected anomaly clusters. While uniform sampling can be designed using geometric principles, close exploration of clusters depends on the spatial distribution of anomalies and must be learned. In our implementation, the close exploration behavior is learned using deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several established baselines.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a general framework for wireless Coexistence Parameter Management (CPM) based on state-augmented constrained reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm, QaSAL-CPM, which incorporates state-augmentation by embedding the dual variables in the constrained optimization formulation directly into the agent's observation space. This method enables the agent to respond to constraint violations in real time while continuing to optimize a primary performance objective. Through extensive simulations of 5G NR-U and Wi-Fi coexistence scenarios, we show that QaSAL-CPM achieves reliable QoS compliance and improved policy robustness across various transmitter densities compared to previous approaches. The proposed framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution for real-time coexistence optimization in next-generation wireless networks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

A significant hurdle is the current lack of standardized infrastructure, which hinders integrating diverse tools, generating rich interaction data, and training robust agents effectively. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenThinkIMG, the first open-source, comprehensive end-to-end framework for tool-augmented LVLMs. It features standardized vision tool interfaces, scalable trajectory generation for policy initialization, and a flexible training environment. Furthermore, considering supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on static demonstrations offers limited policy generalization for dynamic tool invocation, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework V-ToolRL to train LVLMs to learn adaptive policies for invoking external vision tools. V-ToolRL enables LVLMs to autonomously discover optimal tool-usage strategies by directly optimizing for task success using feedback from tool interactions. We empirically validate V-ToolRL on challenging chart reasoning tasks. Our RL-trained agent, built upon a Qwen2-VL-2B, significantly outperforms its SFT-initialized counterpart (+28.83 points) and surpasses established supervised tool-learning baselines like Taco and CogCom by an average of +12.7 points. Notably, it also surpasses prominent closed-source models like GPT-4.1 by +8.68 accuracy points. We hope OpenThinkIMG can serve as a foundational framework for advancing dynamic, tool-augmented visual reasoning, helping the community develop AI agents that can genuinely "think with images".</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Designing Adaptive Algorithms Based on Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Optimization of Sliding Window Size in Multi-Dimensional Data Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06901v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-dimensional data streams, prevalent in applications like IoT, financial markets, and real-time analytics, pose significant challenges due to their high velocity, unbounded nature, and complex inter-dimensional dependencies. Sliding window techniques are critical for processing such streams, but fixed-size windows struggle to adapt to dynamic changes like concept drift or bursty patterns. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach to dynamically optimize sliding window sizes for multi-dimensional data streams. By formulating window size selection as an RL problem, we enable an agent to learn an adaptive policy based on stream characteristics, such as variance, correlations, and temporal trends. Our method, RL-Window, leverages a Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) with prioritized experience replay to handle non-stationarity and high-dimensionality. Evaluations on benchmark datasets (UCI HAR, PAMAP2, Yahoo! Finance Stream) demonstrate that RL-Window outperforms state-of-the-art methods like ADWIN and CNN-Adaptive in classification accuracy, drift robustness, and computational efficiency. Additional qualitative analyses, extended metrics (e.g., energy efficiency, latency), and a comprehensive dataset characterization further highlight its adaptability and stability, making it suitable for real-time applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Episodic Contextual Bandits with Knapsacks under Conversion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06859v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study an online setting, where a decision maker (DM) interacts with contextual bandit-with-knapsack (BwK) instances in repeated episodes. These episodes start with different resource amounts, and the contexts' probability distributions are non-stationary in an episode. All episodes share the same latent conversion model, which governs the random outcome contingent upon a request's context and an allocation decision. Our model captures applications such as dynamic pricing on perishable resources with episodic replenishment, and first price auctions in repeated episodes with different starting budgets. We design an online algorithm that achieves a regret sub-linear in $T$, the number of episodes, assuming access to a \emph{confidence bound oracle} that achieves an $o(T)$-regret. Such an oracle is readily available from existing contextual bandit literature. We overcome the technical challenge with arbitrarily many possible contexts, which leads to a reinforcement learning problem with an unbounded state space. Our framework provides improved regret bounds in certain settings when the DM is provided with unlabeled feature data, which is novel to the contextual BwK literature.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging ensemble learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL) framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while optimizing their aggregation after the fine-tuning to improve efficiency and flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the hidden states of individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor reflection generation tasks, using text classification models to score the generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds), improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across multiple objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, accepted by the SIGDIAL 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Articulated Tool Manipulation with Multifingered Hand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06822v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulating articulated tools, such as tweezers or scissors, has rarely been explored in previous research. Unlike rigid tools, articulated tools change their shape dynamically, creating unique challenges for dexterous robotic hands. In this work, we present a hierarchical, goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) framework to improve the manipulation capabilities of anthropomorphic robotic hands using articulated tools. Our framework comprises two policy layers: (1) a low-level policy that enables the dexterous hand to manipulate the tool into various configurations for objects of different sizes, and (2) a high-level policy that defines the tool's goal state and controls the robotic arm for object-picking tasks. We employ an encoder, trained on synthetic pointclouds, to estimate the tool's affordance states--specifically, how different tool configurations (e.g., tweezer opening angles) enable grasping of objects of varying sizes--from input point clouds, thereby enabling precise tool manipulation. We also utilize a privilege-informed heuristic policy to generate replay buffer, improving the training efficiency of the high-level policy. We validate our approach through real-world experiments, showing that the robot can effectively manipulate a tweezer-like tool to grasp objects of diverse shapes and sizes with a 70.8 % success rate. This study highlights the potential of RL to advance dexterous robotic manipulation of articulated tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025). copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[Noise tolerance via reinforcement: Learning a reinforced quantum dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12418v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of quantum simulations heavily depends on the efficiency of noise mitigation techniques and error correction algorithms. Reinforcement has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the efficiency of learning and optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that a reinforced quantum dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy environment. We study a quantum annealing process where, through reinforcement, the system is encouraged to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free evolution. A learning algorithm is employed to derive a concise approximation of this reinforced dynamics, reducing the total evolution time and, consequently, the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This also avoids the complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such reinforcement algorithms. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of reinforced quantum annealing with one- and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.</p></details> | 25 pages, 12 figures |

The formulation of the method takes advantage of results connecting performance to bounds for the KL-divergence between demonstrated and learned policies, and its objective is rigorously justified through a connection to a probabilistic inference framework for reinforcement learning, incorporating the reinforcement learning objective and the objective to abide by constraints in an entropy maximization setting. The proposed algorithm optimizes the learning objective with dual gradient descent, supporting effective and stable training. Experiments show that the proposed method can learn effective policy models for constraints-abiding behaviour, in settings with multiple constraints of different types, accommodating different modalities of demonstrated behaviour, and with abilities to generalize.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning-based Feature Generation Algorithm for Scientific Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03498v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature generation (FG) aims to enhance the prediction potential of original data by constructing high-order feature combinations and removing redundant features. It is a key preprocessing step for tabular scientific data to improve downstream machine-learning model performance. Traditional methods face the following two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific data: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in scientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise. Secondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space expands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption. Advancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have opened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by that, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in the iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical transformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature combinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement learning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration phase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively evaluate the generated features of each significant model performance breakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate that the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process and significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, in Chinese language, accepted by Journal of Computer Research and Development</p></details> |
| **[Robust Multimodal Large Language Models Against Modality Conflict](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07151v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Multi-parameter Control for the $(1+(λ,λ))$-GA on OneMax via Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12982v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that evolutionary algorithms can benefit from dynamic choices of the key parameters that control their behavior, to adjust their search strategy to the different stages of the optimization process. A prominent example where dynamic parameter choices have shown a provable super-constant speed-up is the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing the OneMax function. While optimal parameter control policies result in linear expected running times, this is not possible with static parameter choices. This result has spurred a lot of interest in parameter control policies. However, many works, in particular theoretical running time analyses, focus on controlling one single parameter. Deriving policies for controlling multiple parameters remains very challenging. In this work we reconsider the problem of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing OneMax. We decouple its four main parameters and investigate how well state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning techniques can approximate good control policies. We show that although making deep reinforcement learning learn effectively is a challenging task, once it works, it is very powerful and is able to find policies that outperform all previously known control policies on the same benchmark. Based on the results found through reinforcement learning, we derive a simple control policy that consistently outperforms the default theory-recommended setting by $27\%$ and the irace-tuned policy, the strongest existing control policy on this benchmark, by $13\%$, for all tested problem sizes up to $40{,}000$.</p></details> |  |
| **[QoE Optimization for Semantic Self-Correcting Video Transmission in Multi-UAV Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06717v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video streaming is essential for time-sensitive applications, including remote surveillance, emergency response, and environmental monitoring. However, it faces challenges such as limited bandwidth, latency fluctuations, and high packet loss. To address these issues, we propose a novel semantic self-correcting video transmission framework with ultra-fine bitrate granularity (SSCV-G). In SSCV-G, video frames are encoded into a compact semantic codebook space, and the transmitter adaptively sends a subset of semantic indices based on bandwidth availability, enabling fine-grained bitrate control for improved bandwidth efficiency. At the receiver, a spatio-temporal vision transformer (ST-ViT) performs multi-frame joint decoding to reconstruct dropped semantic indices by modeling intra- and inter-frame dependencies. To further improve performance under dynamic network conditions, we integrate a multi-user proximal policy optimization (MUPPO) reinforcement learning scheme that jointly optimizes communication resource allocation and semantic bitrate selection to maximize user Quality of Experience (QoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SSCV-G significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video codecs in coding efficiency, bandwidth adaptability, and packet loss robustness. Moreover, the proposed MUPPO-based QoE optimization consistently surpasses existing benchmarks.</p></details> | 13 pages |

To address this, we introduce Quality Diversity Inverse Reinforcement Learning (QD-IRL), a novel framework that integrates quality-diversity optimization with IRL methods, enabling agents to learn diverse behaviors from limited demonstrations. This work introduces Extrinsic Behavioral Curiosity (EBC), which allows agents to receive additional curiosity rewards from an external critic based on how novel the behaviors are with respect to a large behavioral archive. To validate the effectiveness of EBC in exploring diverse locomotion behaviors, we evaluate our method on multiple robot locomotion tasks. EBC improves the performance of QD-IRL instances with GAIL, VAIL, and DiffAIL across all included environments by up to 185%, 42%, and 150%, even surpassing expert performance by 20% in Humanoid. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EBC is applicable to Gradient-Arborescence-based Quality Diversity Reinforcement Learning (QD-RL) algorithms, where it substantially improves performance and provides a generic technique for diverse robot locomotion.

However, current IfO research focuses on idealized scenarios with mostly bimodal-quality data distributions, restricting the meaningfulness of the results. In contrast, this paper investigates more nuanced distributions and introduces a method to learn from such data, moving closer to a paradigm in which imitation learning can be performed iteratively via self-improvement. Our method adapts RL-based imitation learning to action-free demonstrations, using a value function to transfer information between expert and non-expert data. Through comprehensive evaluation, we delineate the relation between different data distributions and the applicability of algorithms and highlight the limitations of established methods. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and practical IfO techniques on a path to scalable behaviour learning.</p></details> |  |

While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables socially integrated robot behavior, challenges persist in novel or perturbed scenarios to indicate when and why the policy is uncertain. Unknown uncertainty in decision-making can lead to collisions or human discomfort and is one reason why safe and risk-aware navigation is still an open problem. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates aleatoric, epistemic, and predictive uncertainty estimation into a DRL navigation framework for policy distribution uncertainty estimates. We, therefore, incorporate Observation-Dependent Variance (ODV) and dropout into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. For different types of perturbations, we compare the ability of deep ensembles and Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) to estimate the uncertainties of the policy. In uncertain decision-making situations, we propose to change the robot's social behavior to conservative collision avoidance. The results show improved training performance with ODV and dropout in PPO and reveal that the training scenario has an impact on the generalization. In addition, MC-dropout is more sensitive to perturbations and correlates the uncertainty type to the perturbation better. With the safe action selection, the robot can navigate in perturbed environments with fewer collisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 8 pages, 6 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |

However, current offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods face substantial challenges when applied to sparse advertising scenarios, primarily due to severe overestimation, distributional shifts, and overlooking budget constraints. To address these issues, we propose MTORL, a novel multi-task offline RL model that targets two key objectives. First, we establish a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework specific to the nuances of advertising. Then, we develop a causal state encoder to capture dynamic user interests and temporal dependencies, facilitating offline RL through conditional sequence modeling. Causal attention mechanisms are introduced to enhance user sequence representations by identifying correlations among causal states. We employ multi-task learning to decode actions and rewards, simultaneously addressing channel recommendation and budget allocation. Notably, our framework includes an automated system for integrating these tasks into online advertising. Extensive experiments on offline and online environments demonstrate MTORL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |

One method for improving robustness is unsupervised environment design (UED), a suite of methods aiming to maximise an agent's generalisability across configurations of an environment. In this work, we study UED from an optimisation perspective, providing stronger theoretical guarantees for practical settings than prior work. Whereas previous methods relied on guarantees if they reach convergence, our framework employs a nonconvex-strongly-concave objective for which we provide a provably convergent algorithm in the zero-sum setting. We empirically verify the efficacy of our method, outperforming prior methods in a number of environments with varying difficulties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reinf...</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning Conference 2025</p></details> |

However, it is challenging for existing multi-task learning methods to handle complex problems, as they are unable to handle unrelated tasks and possess limited knowledge transfer capabilities. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical approach that efficiently addresses these challenges. The high-level module utilizes a skill graph, while the low-level module employs a standard MARL algorithm. Our approach offers two contributions. First, we consider the MT-MARL problem in the context of unrelated tasks, expanding the scope of MTRL. Second, the skill graph is used as the upper layer of the standard hierarchical approach, with training independent of the lower layer, effectively handling unrelated tasks and enhancing knowledge transfer capabilities. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate these advantages and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the latest hierarchical MAPPO algorithms.

A variety of multi-robot search algorithms exist that usually formulate and solve the associated autonomous motion planning problem as a heuristic model-free or belief model-based optimization process. Most of these algorithms however remains tested only in simulation, thereby losing the opportunity to generate knowledge about how such algorithms would compare/contrast in a real physical setting in terms of search performance and real-time computing performance. To address this gap, this paper presents a new lab-scale physical setup and associated open-source software pipeline to evaluate and benchmark multi-robot search algorithms. The presented physical setup innovatively uses an acoustic source (that is safe and inexpensive) and small ground robots (e-pucks) operating in a standard motion-capture environment. This setup can be easily recreated and used by most robotics researchers. The acoustic source also presents interesting uncertainty in terms of its noise-to-signal ratio, which is useful to assess sim-to-real gaps. The overall software pipeline is designed to readily interface with any multi-robot search algorithm with minimal effort and is executable in parallel asynchronous form. This pipeline includes a framework for distributed implementation of multi-robot or swarm search algorithms, integrated with a ROS (Robotics Operating System)-based software stack for motion capture supported localization. The utility of this novel setup is demonstrated by using it to evaluate two state-of-the-art multi-robot search algorithms, based on swarm optimization and batch-Bayesian Optimization (called Bayes-Swarm), as well as a random walk baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in proceedings of ASME IDETC 2025</p></details> |

Although training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation. Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes. We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover task.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 table</p></details> |

In most robotic scenarios with sim-to-real transfer, we have information about joint positions in both simulation and reality, but the EE position is only available in simulation. We developed a novel method to overcome this difficulty based on haptic feedback calibration, using a touchscreen in front of the robot that provides information on the EE position in the real environment. During the calibration procedure, the robot touches specific points on the screen, and the information is stored. In the next stage, we build a transformation function from the data based on linear transformation and neural networks that is capable of outputting all missing variables from any partial input (simulated/real joint/EE position). Our results demonstrate that a fully nonlinear neural network model performs best, significantly reducing positioning errors.</p></details> | ICANN 2025 |

However, achieving efficient whole-body control (WBC) in humanoids remains a fundamental challenge due to sophisticated dynamics, underactuation, and diverse task requirements. While learning-based controllers have shown promise for complex tasks, their reliance on labor-intensive and costly retraining for new scenarios limits real-world applicability. To address these limitations, behavior(al) foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a new paradigm that leverages large-scale pre-training to learn reusable primitive skills and broad behavioral priors, enabling zero-shot or rapid adaptation to a wide range of downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of BFMs for humanoid WBC, tracing their development across diverse pre-training pipelines. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications, current limitations, urgent challenges, and future opportunities, positioning BFMs as a key approach toward scalable and general-purpose humanoid intelligence. Finally, we provide a curated and long-term list of BFM papers and projects to facilitate more subsequent research, which is available at https://github.com/yuanmingqi/awesome-bfm-papers.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

Existing studies have investigated ideal rotational shapes for practical applications, yet they do not discuss how these shapes can be consistently achieved through manipulation planning. Our work presents a manipulation strategy for stable and consistent shape transitions. We find that the configuration space of such a chain is homeomorphic to a three-dimensional cube. Using this property, we suggest a strategy to manipulate the chain into different configurations, specifically from one rotation mode to another, while taking stability and feasibility into consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in physical experiments by successfully transitioning from rest to the first two rotation modes. The concepts explored in our work have critical applications in ensuring safety and efficiency of drill string and yarn spinning operations.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Relative Pose Estimation for Nonholonomic Robot Formation with UWB-IO Measurements (Extended version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05481v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article studies the problem of distributed formation control for multiple robots by using onboard ultra wide band (UWB) distance and inertial odometer (IO) measurements. Although this problem has been widely studied, a fundamental limitation of most works is that they require each robot's pose and sensor measurements are expressed in a common reference frame. However, it is inapplicable for nonholonomic robot formations due to the practical difficulty of aligning IO measurements of individual robot in a common frame. To address this problem, firstly, a concurrent-learning based estimator is firstly proposed to achieve relative localization between neighboring robots in a local frame. Different from most relative localization methods in a global frame, both relative position and orientation in a local frame are estimated with only UWB ranging and IO measurements. Secondly, to deal with information loss caused by directed communication topology, a cooperative localization algorithm is introduced to estimate the relative pose to the leader robot. Thirdly, based on the theoretical results on relative pose estimation, a distributed formation tracking controller is proposed for nonholonomic robots. Both 3D and 2D real-world experiments conducted on aerial robots and grounded robots are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 15 pages, 21 figures |

Current methods rely on pre-built maps and assume static environments, limiting their effectiveness in real-world settings. There is a critical gap in re-finding targets under topographic (e.g., walls, corners) and dynamic (e.g., moving pedestrians) occlusions. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic-guided search framework that dynamically builds environmental maps while following the target and explicitly addresses these two types of occlusions through distinct mechanisms. For topographic occlusions, a belief-guided search field estimates the likelihood of the target's presence and guides search toward promising frontiers. For dynamic occlusions, an observation-based search strategy adaptively switches between a fluid-following field and an overtaking potential field based on occluder motion patterns. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of search efficiency and success rates, both in simulations and real-world tests. Our target search method enhances the adaptability and reliability of RPF systems in unknown and dynamic environments, supporting their use in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics.

However, reinforcement learning-based motion policies often suffer from robustness degradation due to the sim-to-real dynamics gap, thereby affecting the agility of real robots. In this work, we propose a novel robust adversarial training paradigm designed to enhance the robustness of humanoid motion policies in real worlds. The paradigm introduces a learnable adversarial attack network that precisely identifies vulnerabilities in motion policies and applies targeted perturbations, forcing the motion policy to enhance its robustness against perturbations through dynamic adversarial training. We conduct experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot for both perceptive locomotion and whole-body control tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances the robot's motion robustness in real world environments, enabling successful traversal of challenging terrains and highly agile whole-body trajectory tracking.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |

However, most commercial robots are not equipped with tactile skins, making it challenging to achieve even basic touch-sensing functions, such as contact localization. We present UniTac, a data-driven whole-body touch-sensing approach that uses only proprioceptive joint sensors and does not require the installation of additional sensors. Our approach enables a robot equipped solely with joint sensors to localize contacts. Our goal is to democratize touch sensing and provide an off-the-shelf tool for HRI researchers to provide their robots with touch-sensing capabilities. We validate our approach on two platforms: the Franka robot arm and the Spot quadruped. On Franka, we can localize contact to within 8.0 centimeters, and on Spot, we can localize to within 7.2 centimeters at around 2,000 Hz on an RTX 3090 GPU without adding any additional sensors to the robot.

We leverage deep reinforcement learning to train a single locomotion policy on procedurally generated robots. The policy maps proprioceptive robot state information and base velocity commands into desired joint actuation targets, which are conditioned using a latent embedding of the temporally local system dynamics. We explore two conditioning strategies - one using a GRU-based dynamics encoder and another using a morphology-based property estimator - and show that morphology-aware conditioning outperforms temporal dynamics encoding regarding velocity task tracking for our hardware test on ANYmal C. Our results demonstrate that both approaches achieve robust zero-shot transfer across multiple unseen simulated quadrupeds. Furthermore, we demonstrate the need for careful robot reference modelling during training: exposing the policy to a diverse set of robot morphologies and dynamics leads to improved generalization, reducing the velocity tracking error by up to 30% compared to the baseline method. Despite PAL not surpassing the best-performing reference-free controller in all cases, our analysis uncovers critical design choices and informs improvements to the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

However, these sensory inputs are often imperfect, leading to distortions in the agent's internal representation of the world. This paper investigates the nature of these perceptual distortions and how they influence autonomous representation learning using a minimal robotic system. We utilize a simulated two-wheeled robot equipped with distance sensors and a compass, operating within a simple square environment. Through analysis of the robot's sensor data during random exploration, we demonstrate how a distorted perceptual space emerges. Despite these distortions, we identify emergent structures within the perceptual space that correlate with the physical environment, revealing how the robot autonomously learns a structured representation for navigation without explicit spatial information. This work contributes to the understanding of embodied cognition, minimal agency, and the role of perception in self-generated navigation strategies in artificial life.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 aut...</summary><p>2 authors, 23 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Despite advances in technique and instrumentation, its success still relies heavily on the surgeon's experience. In this work, a human-robot collaborative system is proposed to perform MASO according to a preoperative plan and under guidance of a surgeon. A task decomposition methodology is used to divide the collaborative surgical procedure into three subtasks: (1) positional control and (2) orientation control, both led by the robot for precise alignment; and (3) force-control, managed by surgeon to ensure safety. Additionally, to achieve patient tracking without the need for a skull clamp, an optical tracking system (OTS) is utilized. Movement of the patient mandibular is measured with an optical-based tracker mounted on a dental occlusal splint. A registration method and Robot-OTS calibration method are introduced to achieve reliable navigation within our framework. The experiments of drilling were conducted on the realistic phantom model, which demonstrated that the average error between the planned and actual drilling points is 1.85mm.</p></details> |  |

Exploring the Effects of a Structured Interface with ChatGPT in a Graduate Robotics Course](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07767v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior research shows that how students engage with Large Language Models (LLMs) influences their problem-solving and understanding, reinforcing the need to support productive LLM-uses that promote learning. This study evaluates the impact of a structured GPT platform designed to promote 'good' prompting behavior with data from 58 students in a graduate-level robotics course. The students were assigned to either an intervention group using the structured platform or a control group using ChatGPT freely for two practice lab sessions, before a third session where all students could freely use ChatGPT. We analyzed student perception (pre-post surveys), prompting behavior (logs), performance (task scores), and learning (pre-post tests). Although we found no differences in performance or learning between groups, we identified prompting behaviors - such as having clear prompts focused on understanding code - that were linked with higher learning gains and were more prominent when students used the structured platform. However, such behaviors did not transfer once students were no longer constrained to use the structured platform. Qualitative survey data showed mixed perceptions: some students perceived the value of the structured platform, but most did not perceive its relevance and resisted changing their habits. These findings contribute to ongoing efforts to identify effective strategies for integrating LLMs into learning and question the effectiveness of bottom-up approaches that temporarily alter user interfaces to influence students' interaction. Future research could instead explore top-down strategies that address students' motivations and explicitly demonstrate how certain interaction patterns support learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted, to appear in the proceedings of the EC-TEL 2025 conference</p></details> |

An interesting real-world application that stands to benefit significantly from deployment of swarms is structural monitoring, where traditional sensor networks face challenges in structural coverage due to their static nature. This paper investigates the deployment of a swarm of miniaturized vibration sensing robots to inspect and localize structural damages on a surface section within a high-fidelity simulation environment. In particular, we consider a 1 m x 1 m x 3 mm steel surface section and utilize finite element analysis using Abaqus to obtain realistic structural vibration data. The resulting vibration data is imported into the physics-based robotic simulator Webots, where we simulate the dynamics of our surface inspecting robot swarm. We employ (i) Gaussian process estimators to guide the robots' exploration as they collect vibration samples across the surface and (ii) operational modal analysis to detect structural damages by estimating and comparing existing and intact structural vibration patterns. We analyze the influence of exploration radii on estimation uncertainty and assess the effectiveness of our method across 10 randomized scenarios, where the number, locations, surface area, and depth of structural damages vary. Our simulation studies validate the efficacy of our miniaturized robot swarm for vibration-based structural inspection.</p></details> |  |

This work presents the development and validation of a haptic-enhanced Virtual Reality simulator for surgical robotics training, featuring 8 surgical tasks that the trainee can interact with thanks to the embedded physics engine. This virtual simulated environment is augmented by the introduction of high-level haptic interfaces for robotic assistance that aim at re-directing the motion of the trainee's hands and wrists toward targets or away from obstacles, and providing a quantitative performance score after the execution of each training exercise.An experimental study shows that the introduction of enhanced robotic assistance into a surgical robotics training curriculum improves performance during the training process and, crucially, promotes the transfer of the acquired skills to an unassisted surgical scenario, like the clinical one.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Models-based Anomaly Detection for under-constrained Cable-Driven Parallel Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07714v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive, unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions. Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4% average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, to be submitted to Advanced Intelligent Systems</p></details> |

Certain inspection tasks require a binary classification decision. This work presents an experimental setup for a surface inspection task based on vibration sensing and studies a Bayesian two-outcome decision-making algorithm in a swarm of miniaturized wheeled robots. The robots are tasked with individually inspecting and collectively classifying a 1mx1m tiled surface consisting of vibrating and non-vibrating tiles based on the majority type of tiles. The robots sense vibrations using onboard IMUs and perform collision avoidance using a set of IR sensors. We develop a simulation and optimization framework leveraging the Webots robotic simulator and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. We consider two existing information sharing strategies and propose a new one that allows the swarm to rapidly reach accurate classification decisions. We first find optimal parameters that allow efficient sampling in simulation and then evaluate our proposed strategy against the two existing ones using 100 randomized simulation and 10 real experiments. We find that our proposed method compels the swarm to make decisions at an accelerated rate, with an improvement of up to 20.52% in mean decision time at only 0.78% loss in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

As a result, expectations are rising for the automation of tasks such as material transport and exploration in unknown environments. However, autonomous locomotion in rough terrains with significant height variations requires vertical movement, and robots capable of performing such movements stably, along with their control methods, have not yet been fully established. In this study, we developed the quadruped robot KLEIYN, which features a waist joint, and aimed to expand quadruped locomotion by enabling chimney climbing through RL. To facilitate the learning of vertical motion, we introduced Contact-Guided Curriculum Learning (CGCL). As a result, KLEIYN successfully climbed walls ranging from 800 mm to 1000 mm in width at an average speed of 150 mm/s, 50 times faster than conventional robots. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the introduction of a waist joint improves climbing performance, particularly enhancing tracking ability on narrow walls.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS2025, website - https://keitayoneda.github.io/kleiyn-chimney-climbing/, YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLfUhyNFOeY</p></details> |

To tackle the issue, numerous data-driven machine learning approaches have been proposed for modeling nonlinear dynamics. However, these models suffer from prediction uncertainty that can negatively affect modeling accuracy, and uncertainty quantification for kinematic modeling in soft robots is underexplored. In this work, using limited simulation and real-world data, we first investigate multiple linear and nonlinear machine learning models commonly used for kinematic modeling of soft robots. The results reveal that nonlinear ensemble methods exhibit the most robust generalization performance. We then develop a conformal kinematic modeling framework for soft robots by utilizing split conformal prediction to quantify predictive position uncertainty, ensuring distribution-free prediction intervals with a theoretical guarantee.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; accepted at the 5th Modeling, Estimation and Control Conference (MECC 2025)</p></details> |

However, existing methods, particularly those based on teacher-student frameworks often suffer from a loss of motion diversity during policy distillation and exhibit limited generalization to unseen behaviors. In this work, we present UniTracker, a simplified yet powerful framework that integrates a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) into the student policy to explicitly model the latent diversity of human motion. By leveraging a learned CVAE prior, our method enables the student to retain expressive motion characteristics while improving robustness and adaptability under partial observations. The result is a single policy capable of tracking a wide spectrum of whole-body motions with high fidelity and stability. Comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world deployments demonstrate that UniTracker significantly outperforms MLP-based DAgger baselines in motion quality, generalization to unseen references, and deployment robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for expressive humanoid control.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Effects of Wrist-Worn Haptic Feedback on Force Accuracy and Task Speed during a Teleoperated Robotic Surgery Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07327v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous work has shown that the addition of haptic feedback to the hands can improve awareness of tool-tissue interactions and enhance performance of teleoperated tasks in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. However, hand-based haptic feedback occludes direct interaction with the manipulanda of surgeon console in teleoperated surgical robots. We propose relocating haptic feedback to the wrist using a wearable haptic device so that haptic feedback mechanisms do not need to be integrated into the manipulanda. However, it is unknown if such feedback will be effective, given that it is not co-located with the finger movements used for manipulation. To test if relocated haptic feedback improves force application during teleoperated tasks using da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) surgical robot, participants learned to palpate a phantom tissue to desired forces. A soft pneumatic wrist-worn haptic device with an anchoring system renders tool-tissue interaction forces to the wrist of the user. Participants performed the palpation task with and without wrist-worn haptic feedback and were evaluated for the accuracy of applied forces. Participants demonstrated statistically significant lower force error when wrist-worn haptic feedback was provided. Participants also performed the palpation task with longer movement times when provided wrist-worn haptic feedback, indicating that the haptic feedback may have caused participants to operate at a different point in the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This lack of agreement makes it difficult not only for new researchers to grasp these concepts, but also for experts who may use the same terms to mean different things. Many attempts have been made to objectively define 'swarm' or 'emergence,' with recent work highlighting the role of the external observer. Still, several researchers argue that once an observer's vantage point (e.g., scope, resolution, context) is established, the terms can be made objective or measured quantitatively. In this note, we propose a framework to discuss these ideas rigorously by separating externally observable states from latent, unobservable ones. This allows us to compare and contrast existing definitions of swarms and emergence on common ground. We argue that these concepts are ultimately subjective-shaped less by the system itself than by the perception and tacit knowledge of the observer. Specifically, we suggest that a 'swarm' is not defined by its group behavior alone, but by the process generating that behavior. Our broader goal is to support the design and deployment of robotic swarm systems, highlighting the critical distinction between multi-robot systems and true swarms.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 tables, 8 figures</p></details> |

Through simulation experiments involving a joint search task performed by a heterogeneous team of two HARMONIC-based robots and a human operator, we demonstrate heterogeneous robots that coordinate their actions, adapt to complex scenarios, and engage in natural human-robot communication. Evaluation results show that HARMONIC-based robots can reason about plans, goals, and team member attitudes while providing clear explanations for their decisions, which are essential requirements for realistic human-robot teaming.</p></details> |  |

However, centralized behaviors are often faster and more efficient than their decentralized counterparts. In any given application, the goals and constraints of the task being solved should guide the choice to use centralized control, decentralized control, or a combination of the two. Currently, the exact trade-offs that exist between centralization and decentralization are not well defined. In this paper, we study comparative performance assessment between centralization and decentralization in the example task of sweep coverage, across five different types of multi-robot control structures: random walk, decentralized with beacons, hybrid formation control using self-organizing hierarchy, centralized formation control, and predetermined. In all five approaches, the coverage task is completed by a group of ground robots. In each approach, except for the random walk, the ground robots are assisted by UAVs, acting as supervisors or beacons. We compare the approaches in terms of three performance metrics for which centralized approaches are expected to have an advantage -- coverage completeness, coverage uniformity, and sweep completion time -- and two metrics for which decentralized approaches are expected to have an advantage -- scalability (4, 8, or 16 ground robots) and fault tolerance (0%, 25%, 50%, or 75% ground robot failure).</p></details> | <details><summary>IRIDI...</summary><p>IRIDIA, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium, 2021</p></details> |

Vine robots, which are soft growing continuum robots that extend their length through soft material eversion at their tip, offer unique advantages due to their ability to navigate tight spaces, adapt to complex paths, and minimize friction. However, existing vine robot designs struggle with navigation in manmade and natural passageways, with branches and sharp 3D turns. In this letter, we introduce a steerable vine robot specifically designed for pipe and burrow environments. The robot features a simple tubular body and an external tip mount that steers the vine robot in three degrees of freedom by changing the growth direction and, when necessary, bracing against the wall of the pipe or burrow. Our external tip steering approach enables: (1) active branch selection in 3D space with a maximum steerable angle of 51.7{\deg}, (2) navigation of pipe networks with radii as small as 2.5 cm, (3) a compliant tip enabling navigation of sharp turns, and (4) real-time 3D localization in GPS-denied environments using tip-mounted sensors and continuum body odometry. We describe the forward kinematics, characterize steerability, and demonstrate the system in a 3D pipe system as well as a natural animal burrow.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions predominantly rely on rigid robotic manipulators, which have challenges in handling deformable garments and ensuring safe physical interaction with the human body. Prior robotic dressing methods require excessive operation times, complex control strategies, and constrained user postures, limiting their practicality and adaptability. This paper proposes a novel soft robotic dressing system, the Self-Wearing Adaptive Garment (SWAG), which uses an unfurling and growth mechanism to facilitate autonomous dressing. Unlike traditional approaches,the SWAG conforms to the human body through an unfurling based deployment method, eliminating skin-garment friction and enabling a safer and more efficient dressing process. We present the working principles of the SWAG, introduce its design and fabrication, and demonstrate its performance in dressing assistance. The proposed system demonstrates effective garment application across various garment configurations, presenting a promising alternative to conventional robotic dressing assistance.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoramic images, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 48 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing SOTA TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |

However, adversarial attacks, such as sensor manipulation, and communication jamming, pose significant challenges to the performance of traditional localization methods. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed fault-tolerant cooperative localization framework to enhance resilience against sensor and communication disruptions in adversarial environments. We introduce an adaptive event-triggered communication strategy that dynamically adjusts communication thresholds based on real-time sensing and communication quality. This strategy ensures optimal performance even in the presence of sensor degradation or communication failure. Furthermore, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the convergence and stability properties of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its resilience against bounded adversarial zones and maintaining accurate state estimation. Robotarium-based experiment results show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of localization accuracy and communication efficiency, particularly in adversarial settings. Our approach offers improved scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance for MRS, making it suitable for large-scale deployments in real-world, challenging environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025 Conference</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce Quality Diversity Inverse Reinforcement Learning (QD-IRL), a novel framework that integrates quality-diversity optimization with IRL methods, enabling agents to learn diverse behaviors from limited demonstrations. This work introduces Extrinsic Behavioral Curiosity (EBC), which allows agents to receive additional curiosity rewards from an external critic based on how novel the behaviors are with respect to a large behavioral archive. To validate the effectiveness of EBC in exploring diverse locomotion behaviors, we evaluate our method on multiple robot locomotion tasks. EBC improves the performance of QD-IRL instances with GAIL, VAIL, and DiffAIL across all included environments by up to 185%, 42%, and 150%, even surpassing expert performance by 20% in Humanoid. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EBC is applicable to Gradient-Arborescence-based Quality Diversity Reinforcement Learning (QD-RL) algorithms, where it substantially improves performance and provides a generic technique for diverse robot locomotion.

Traditional safety models primarily rely on sensor-based measures, such as relative distance and velocity, to assess physical safety. However, these models often fail to capture subjective safety perceptions, which are shaped by individual traits and contextual factors. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a parameterized general safety model that bridges the gap between physical and perceived safety by incorporating a personalization parameter, $\rho$, into the safety measurement framework to account for individual differences in safety perception. Through a series of hypothesis-driven human-subject studies in a simulated rescue scenario, we investigate how emotional state, trust, and robot behavior influence perceived safety. Our results show that $\rho$ effectively captures meaningful individual differences, driven by affective responses, trust in task consistency, and clustering into distinct user types. Specifically, our findings confirm that predictable and consistent robot behavior as well as the elicitation of positive emotional states, significantly enhance perceived safety. Moreover, responses cluster into a small number of user types, supporting adaptive personalization based on shared safety models. Notably, participant role significantly shapes safety perception, and repeated exposure reduces perceived safety for participants in the casualty role, emphasizing the impact of physical interaction and experiential change. These findings highlight the importance of adaptive, human-centered safety models that integrate both psychological and behavioral dimensions, offering a pathway toward more trustworthy and effective HRI in safety-critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE RO-MAN 2025 Conference</p></details> |

However, accurately perceiving human actions and achieving adaptive control remains a challenge in facilitating seamless coordination between human and robotic movements. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical procedural framework to enable dynamic robot-assisted hand-object interaction (HOI). An open-loop hierarchy leverages the RGB-based 3D reconstruction of the human hand, based on which motion primitives have been designed to translate hand motions into robotic actions. The low-level coordination hierarchy fine-tunes the robot's action by using the continuously updated 3D hand models. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the hierarchical control architecture.

| **[Soft Robotics-Inspired Flexible Antenna Arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06589v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, a novel soft continuum robot-inspired antenna array is proposed, featuring tentacle-like structures with multiple antenna elements. The proposed array achieves reconfigurability through continuous deformation of its geometry, in contrast to reconfigurable antennas which incur a per-element control. More specifically, the deformation is modeled by amplitude and spatial frequency parameters. We consider a multi-user multiple-input single-output downlink system, whereby the optimal deformation parameters are found to maximize the sum rate in the network. A successive convex approximation method is adopted to solve the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed deformable array significantly outperforms fixed geometry and per-element reconfigurable arrays in sum rate, demonstrating the benefits of structure-level flexibility for next-generation antenna arrays.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hysteresis-Aware Neural Network Modeling and Whole-Body Reinforcement Learning Control of Soft Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13582v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots exhibit inherent compliance and safety, which makes them particularly suitable for applications requiring direct physical interaction with humans, such as surgical procedures. However, their nonlinear and hysteretic behavior, resulting from the properties of soft materials, presents substantial challenges for accurate modeling and control. In this study, we present a soft robotic system designed for surgical applications and propose a hysteresis-aware whole-body neural network model that accurately captures and predicts the soft robot's whole-body motion, including its hysteretic behavior. Building upon the high-precision dynamic model, we construct a highly parallel simulation environment for soft robot control and apply an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm to efficiently train whole-body motion control strategies. Based on the trained control policy, we developed a soft robotic system for surgical applications and validated it through phantom-based laser ablation experiments in a physical environment. The results demonstrate that the hysteresis-aware modeling reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 84.95 percent compared to traditional modeling methods. The deployed control algorithm achieved a trajectory tracking error ranging from 0.126 to 0.250 mm on the real soft robot, highlighting its precision in real-world conditions. The proposed method showed strong performance in phantom-based surgical experiments and demonstrates its potential for complex scenarios, including future real-world clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated author affiliation</p></details> |

The typical approach is useful to compare learning algorithms but provides limited insight into the effects of different training regimens and little understanding about the richness and complexity of learned behaviors. Likewise, human infants and other animals are "trained" via unsystematic regimens, but in contrast, developmental psychologists evaluate their performance in highly-controlled experiments with fine-grained measures such as success, speed of walking, and prospective adjustments. However, the study of learned behavior in human infants is limited by the practical constraints of training and testing babies. Here, we present a case study that applies methods from developmental psychology to study the learned behavior of the simulated bipedal robot Cassie. Following research on infant walking, we systematically designed reinforcement learning training regimens and tested the resulting controllers in simulated environments analogous to those used for babies--but without the practical constraints. Results reveal new insights into the behavioral impact of different training regimens and the development of Cassie's learned behaviors relative to infants who are learning to walk. This interdisciplinary baby-robot approach provides inspiration for future research designed to systematically test effects of training on the development of complex learned robot behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted into ICDL 2025 as a contributed paper</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Evaluate Autonomous Behaviour in Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06404v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating and comparing the performance of autonomous Humanoid Robots is challenging, as success rate metrics are difficult to reproduce and fail to capture the complexity of robot movement trajectories, critical in Human-Robot Interaction and Collaboration (HRIC). To address these challenges, we propose a general evaluation framework that measures the quality of Imitation Learning (IL) methods by focusing on trajectory performance. We devise the Neural Meta Evaluator (NeME), a deep learning model trained to classify actions from robot joint trajectories. NeME serves as a meta-evaluator to compare the performance of robot control policies, enabling policy evaluation without requiring human involvement in the loop. We validate our framework on ergoCub, a humanoid robot, using teleoperation data and comparing IL methods tailored to the available platform. The experimental results indicate that our method is more aligned with the success rate obtained on the robot than baselines, offering a reproducible, systematic, and insightful means for comparing the performance of multimodal imitation learning approaches in complex HRI tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forex Trading Robot Using Fuzzy Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06383v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose a fuzzy system for conducting short-term transactions in the forex market. The system is designed to enhance common strategies in the forex market using fuzzy logic, thereby improving the accuracy of transactions. Traditionally, technical strategies based on oscillator indicators have relied on predefined ranges for indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Commodity Channel Indicator (CCI), and Stochastic to determine entry points for trades. However, the use of these classic indicators has yielded suboptimal results due to the changing nature of the market over time. In our proposed approach, instead of employing classical indicators, we introduce a fuzzy Mamdani system for each indicator. The results obtained from these systems are then combined through voting to design a trading robot. Our findings demonstrate a considerable increase in the profitability factor compared to three other methods. Additionally, net profit, gross profit, and maximum capital reduction are calculated and compared across all approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, enabling humanoids to reason, plan, and act in complex open-world settings remains a challenge. World models, models that predict the future outcome of a given action, can support these capabilities by serving as a dynamics model in long-horizon planning and generating synthetic data for policy learning. We introduce Humanoid World Models (HWM), a family of lightweight, open-source models that forecast future egocentric video conditioned on humanoid control tokens. We train two types of generative models, Masked Transformers and Flow-Matching, on 100 hours of humanoid demonstrations. Additionally, we explore architectural variants with different attention mechanisms and parameter-sharing strategies. Our parameter-sharing techniques reduce model size by 33-53% with minimal impact on performance or visual fidelity. HWMs are designed to be trained and deployed in practical academic and small-lab settings, such as 1-2 GPUs.</p></details> |  |

While object-centric flow prediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios involving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this work, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly learns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting embodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's inherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile manipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and non-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language instructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment module by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction. Moreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a standard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify kinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We validate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62% improvement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and non-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art object-centric flow methods.

In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do), embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2) multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity, arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation datasets effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/AgiBot-World</p></details> |

A tethered tensile perching mechanism offers a simple, adaptable solution that can be retrofitted to existing robots and accommodates a variety of structure sizes and shapes. However, tethered tensile perching introduces significant modelling challenges which require precise management of aerial robot dynamics, including the cases of tether slack & tension, and momentum transfer. Achieving smooth wrapping and secure anchoring by targeting a specific tether segment adds further complexity. In this work, we present a novel trajectory framework for tethered tensile perching, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) through the Soft Actor-Critic from Demonstrations (SACfD) algorithm. By incorporating both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations, our approach enhances training efficiency and responsiveness, achieving precise control over position and velocity. This framework enables the aerial robot to accurately target specific tether segments, facilitating reliable wrapping and secure anchoring. We validate our framework through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, and demonstrate effectiveness in achieving agile and reliable trajectory generation for tensile perching.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Effective performance in this domain requires coordinating a multi-robot inspection team to prioritize inspecting locations more likely to need immediate response, while also minimizing travel time. This is particularly challenging because robots must directly observe the locations to determine which ones require additional attention. This work introduces a multi-robot planning framework for coordinated time-critical multi-robot search under uncertainty. Our approach uses a graph neural network to estimate the likelihood of PoIs needing attention from noisy sensor data and then uses those predictions to guide a multi-robot model-based planner to determine the cost-effective plan. Simulated experiments demonstrate that our planner improves performance at least by 16.3\%, 26.7\%, and 26.2\% for 1, 3, and 5 robots, respectively, compared to non-learned and learned baselines. We also validate our approach on real-world platforms using quad-copters.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, CASE 2025</p></details> |

Three of the primary areas are studied and covered in this review: how AR can improve social and learning results, how LLMs can support communication, and how UI/UX design affects how effective these technologies can be. Results show that while LLMs can provide individualized learning and communication support, AR has shown promise in enhancing social skills, motivation, and attention. For children with ASD, accessible and engaging interventions rely heavily on effective UI/UX design, but there is still a significant lack of robotics-based education and therapeutic programs specifically tailored for autistic children. To optimize the benefits of these technologies in ASD therapies and immersive education, the study emphasizes the need for additional research to address difficulties related to customization, accessibility, and integration.</p></details> | none |
| **[SCCRUB: Surface Cleaning Compliant Robot Utilizing Bristles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06053v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scrubbing surfaces is a physically demanding and time-intensive task. Removing adhered contamination requires substantial friction generated through pressure and torque or high lateral forces. Rigid robotic manipulators, while capable of exerting these forces, are usually confined to structured environments isolated from humans due to safety risks. In contrast, soft robot arms can safely work around humans and adapt to environmental uncertainty, but typically struggle to transmit the continuous torques or lateral forces necessary for scrubbing. Here, we demonstrate a soft robotic arm scrubbing adhered residues using torque and pressure, a task traditionally challenging for soft robots. We train a neural network to learn the arm's inverse kinematics and elasticity, which enables open-loop force and position control. Using this learned model, the robot successfully scrubbed burnt food residue from a plate and sticky fruit preserve from a toilet seat, removing an average of 99.7% of contamination. This work demonstrates how soft robots, capable of exerting continuous torque, can effectively and safely scrub challenging contamination from surfaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[AURA-CVC: Autonomous Ultrasound-guided Robotic Assistance for Central Venous Catheterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05979v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Central venous catheterization (CVC) is a critical medical procedure for vascular access, hemodynamic monitoring, and life-saving interventions. Its success remains challenging due to the need for continuous ultrasound-guided visualization of a target vessel and approaching needle, which is further complicated by anatomical variability and operator dependency. Errors in needle placement can lead to life-threatening complications. While robotic systems offer a potential solution, achieving full autonomy remains challenging. In this work, we propose an end-to-end robotic-ultrasound-guided CVC pipeline, from scan initialization to needle insertion. Methods: We introduce a deep-learning model to identify clinically relevant anatomical landmarks from a depth image of the patient's neck, obtained using RGB-D camera, to autonomously define the scanning region and paths. Then, a robot motion planning framework is proposed to scan, segment, reconstruct, and localize vessels (veins and arteries), followed by the identification of the optimal insertion zone. Finally, a needle guidance module plans the insertion under ultrasound guidance with operator's feedback. This pipeline was validated on a high-fidelity commercial phantom across 10 simulated clinical scenarios. Results: The proposed pipeline achieved 10 out of 10 successful needle placements on the first attempt. Vessels were reconstructed with a mean error of 2.15 \textit{mm}, and autonomous needle insertion was performed with an error less than or close to 1 \textit{mm}. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first robotic CVC system demonstrated on a high-fidelity phantom with integrated planning, scanning, and insertion. Experimental results show its potential for clinical translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting and Diagnosing Faults in Autonomous Robot Swarms with an Artificial Antibody Population Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19942v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An active approach to fault tolerance, the combined processes of fault detection, diagnosis, and recovery, is essential for long term autonomy in robots -- particularly multi-robot systems and swarms. Previous efforts have primarily focussed on spontaneously occurring electro-mechanical failures in the sensors and actuators of a minority sub-population of robots. While the systems that enable this function are valuable, they have not yet considered that many failures arise from gradual wear and tear with continued operation, and that this may be more challenging to detect than sudden step changes in performance. This paper presents the Artificial Antibody Population Dynamics (AAPD) model -- an immune-inspired model for the detection and diagnosis of gradual degradation in robot swarms. The AAPD model is demonstrated to reliably detect and diagnose gradual degradation, as well as spontaneous changes in performance, among swarms of robots of varying sizes while remaining tolerant of normally behaving robots. The AAPD model is distributed, offers supervised and unsupervised configurations, and demonstrates promising scalable properties. Deploying the AAPD model on a swarm of foraging robots undergoing gradual degradation enables the swarm to operate on average at between 70% - 97% of its performance in perfect conditions and is able to prevent instances of robots failing in the field during experiments in most of the cases tested.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes a holistic framework for construction task specification, optimization of robot morphology, and mission execution using a mobile modular reconfigurable robot. Users can specify and monitor the desired robot behavior through a graphical interface. In contrast to existing, monolithic solutions, we automatically identify a new task-tailored robot for every task by integrating \acf{bim}. Our framework leverages modular robot components that enable the fast adaption of robot hardware to the specific demands of the construction task. Other than previous works on modular robot optimization, we consider multiple competing objectives, which allow us to explicitly model the challenges of real-world transfer, such as calibration errors. We demonstrate our framework in simulation by optimizing robots for drilling and spray painting.

To achieve similar adaptability, robots must accurately estimate human trust at sufficiently granular timescales while collaborating with humans. Beta reputation is a popular way to formalize a mathematical estimation of human trust. However, it relies on binary performance, which updates trust estimations only after each task concludes. Additionally, manually crafting a reward function is the usual method of building a performance indicator, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. These limitations prevent efficient capture of continuous trust changes at more granular timescales throughout the collaboration task. Therefore, this paper presents a new framework for the estimation of human trust using beta reputation at fine-grained timescales. To achieve granularity in beta reputation, we utilize continuous reward values to update trust estimates at each timestep of a task. We construct a continuous reward function using maximum entropy optimization to eliminate the need for the laborious specification of a performance indicator. The proposed framework improves trust estimations by increasing accuracy, eliminating the need to manually craft a reward function, and advancing toward the development of more intelligent robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) 2025</p></details> |
| **[On the Robotic Uncertainty of Fully Autonomous Traffic: From Stochastic Car-Following to Mobility-Safety Trade-Offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12611v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent transportation research highlights the potential of autonomous vehicles (AV) to improve traffic flow mobility as they are able to maintain smaller car-following distances. However, as a unique class of ground robots, AVs are susceptible to robotic errors, particularly in their perception and control modules with imperfect sensors and actuators, leading to uncertainties in their movements and an increased risk of collisions. Consequently, conservative operational strategies, such as larger headway and slower speeds, are implemented to prioritize safety over mobility in real-world operations. To reconcile the inconsistency, this paper presents an analytical model framework that delineates the endogenous reciprocity between traffic safety and mobility that arises from AVs' robotic uncertainties. Using both realistic car-following data and a stochastic intelligent driving model (IDM), the stochastic car-following distance is derived as a key parameter, enabling analysis of single-lane capacity and collision probability. A semi-Markov process is then employed to model the dynamics of the lane capacity, and the resulting collision-inclusive capacity, representing expected lane capacity under stationary conditions, serves as the primary performance metric for fully autonomous traffic. The analytical results are further utilized to investigate the impacts of critical parameters in AV and roadway designs on traffic performance, as well as the properties of optimal speed and headway under mobility-targeted or safety-dominated management objectives. Extensions to scenarios involving multiple non-independent collisions or multi-lane traffic scenarios are also discussed, which demonstrates the robustness of the theoretical results and their practical applications.</p></details> |  |

In most of theoretical models, the shape variables, i.e. joint angles, are directly prescribed as periodic inputs, such as steering angle of the Twistcar. In this work, we study a variant of the Twistcar model where the actuation input is periodic oscillations of an inertial rotor attached to the main body, while the steering joint is passively free to rotate. Remarkably, the dynamics of this model is extremely rich, and includes multiplicity of periodic solutions, both symmetric and asymmetric, as well as stability transitions and bifurcations. We conduct numerical simulations as well as asymptotic analysis of the vehicle's reduced equations of motion. We use perturbation expansion in order to obtain leading-order dynamics under symmetric periodic solution. Then, we utilize harmonic balance and further scaling assumptions in order to approximate the conditions for symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation and stability transition of the symmetric periodic solution, as a function of actuation frequency and structural parameters. The asymptotic results show good agreement with numerical simulations. The results highlight the role of passive shape variables in generating multi-stable periodic solutions for nonholonomic systems of robotic locomotion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppo...</summary><p>Supporting Information is available at https://yizhar.net.technion.ac.il/files/2025/06/SI-MATLAB-file-Anna-Z.zip</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Diffusion Policies with Projective Geometric Algebra for Efficient Robot Manipulation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05695v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have become increasingly popular in robot learning due to their reliable convergence in motion generation tasks. At a high level, these policies learn to transform noisy action trajectories into effective ones, conditioned on observations. However, each time such a model is trained in a robotics context, the network must relearn fundamental spatial representations and operations, such as translations and rotations, from scratch in order to ground itself and operate effectively in a 3D environment. Incorporating geometric inductive biases directly into the network can alleviate this redundancy and substantially improve training efficiency. In this paper, we introduce hPGA-DP, a diffusion policy approach that integrates a mathematical framework called Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) to embed strong geometric inductive biases. PGA is particularly well-suited for this purpose as it provides a unified algebraic framework that naturally encodes geometric primitives, such as points, directions, and rotations, enabling neural networks to reason about spatial structure through interpretable and composable operations. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion policy architecture that incorporates the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr), leveraging its E(3)-equivariant properties established in prior work. Our approach adopts a hybrid architecture strategy, using P-GATr as both a state encoder and action decoder, while employing U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the denoising process. Several experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that hPGA-DP not only improves task performance and training efficiency through the geometric bias of P-GATr, but also achieves substantially faster convergence through its hybrid model compared to architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging generative models, particularly diffusion models, these approaches offer notable advantages such as strong multi-task generalization, effective language conditioning, and high sample efficiency. While their application has been successful in manipulation tasks, their use in legged locomotion remains relatively underexplored, mainly due to compounding errors that affect stability and difficulties in task transition under limited data. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results in legged robot control in the past years, providing valuable insights to address these challenges. In this work, we propose DMLoco, a diffusion-based framework for quadruped robots that integrates multi-task pretraining with online PPO finetuning to enable language-conditioned control and robust task transitions. Our approach first pretrains the policy on a diverse multi-task dataset using diffusion models, enabling language-guided execution of various skills. Then, it finetunes the policy in simulation to ensure robustness and stable task transition during real-world deployment. By utilizing Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for efficient sampling and TensorRT for optimized deployment, our policy runs onboard at 50Hz, offering a scalable and efficient solution for adaptive, language-guided locomotion on resource-constrained robotic platforms.</p></details> |  |

To improve data collection efficiency, some approaches focus on developing specialized teleoperation devices for robot control, while others directly use human hand demonstrations to obtain training data. However, the former requires both a robotic system and a skilled operator, limiting scalability, while the latter faces challenges in aligning the visual gap between human hand demonstrations and the deployed robot observations. To address this, we propose a human hand data collection system combined with our hand-to-gripper generative model, which translates human hand demonstrations into robot gripper demonstrations, effectively bridging the observation gap. Specifically, a GoPro fisheye camera is mounted on the human wrist to capture human hand demonstrations. We then train a generative model on a self-collected dataset of paired human hand and UMI gripper demonstrations, which have been processed using a tailored data pre-processing strategy to ensure alignment in both timestamps and observations. Therefore, given only human hand demonstrations, we are able to automatically extract the corresponding SE(3) actions and integrate them with high-quality generated robot demonstrations through our generation pipeline for training robotic policy model. In experiments, the robust manipulation performance demonstrates not only the quality of the generated robot demonstrations but also the efficiency and practicality of our data collection method.

This dataset opens up possibilities for a broad range of computer vision tasks that might benefit from high resolution data, such as super resolution (SR), smoke removal, surgical instrument detection, 3D tissue reconstruction, monocular depth estimation, instance segmentation, novel view synthesis, and vision-language model (VLM) development. SurgiSR4K provides a robust foundation for advancing research in high-resolution surgical imaging and fosters the development of intelligent imaging technologies aimed at enhancing performance, safety, and usability in image-guided robotic surgeries.</p></details> |  |
| **[From LLMs to Actions: Latent Codes as Bridges in Hierarchical Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04798v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical control for robotics has long been plagued by the need to have a well defined interface layer to communicate between high-level task planners and low-level policies. With the advent of LLMs, language has been emerging as a prospective interface layer. However, this has several limitations. Not all tasks can be decomposed into steps that are easily expressible in natural language (e.g. performing a dance routine). Further, it makes end-to-end finetuning on embodied data challenging due to domain shift and catastrophic forgetting. We introduce our method -- Learnable Latent Codes as Bridges (LCB) -- as an alternate architecture to overcome these limitations. \method~uses a learnable latent code to act as a bridge between LLMs and low-level policies. This enables LLMs to flexibly communicate goals in the task plan without being entirely constrained by language limitations. Additionally, it enables end-to-end finetuning without destroying the embedding space of word tokens learned during pre-training. Through experiments on Language Table and Calvin, two common language based benchmarks for embodied agents, we find that \method~outperforms baselines (including those w/ GPT-4V) that leverage pure language as the interface layer on tasks that require reasoning and multi-step behaviors.</p></details> |  |

Can similar ideas improve reinforcement learning (RL)? We answer affirmatively by observing that incorporating action sequences when predicting ground-truth return-to-go leads to lower validation loss. Motivated by this, we introduce Coarse-to-fine Q-Network with Action Sequence (CQN-AS), a novel value-based RL algorithm that learns a critic network that outputs Q-values over a sequence of actions, i.e., explicitly training the value function to learn the consequence of executing action sequences. Our experiments show that CQN-AS outperforms several baselines on a variety of sparse-reward humanoid control and tabletop manipulation tasks from BiGym and RLBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages.

| **[Occlusion-Aware Consistent Model Predictive Control for Robot Navigation in Occluded Obstacle-Dense Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04563v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety and motion consistency for robot navigation in occluded, obstacle-dense environments is a critical challenge. In this context, this study presents an occlusion-aware Consistent Model Predictive Control (CMPC) strategy. To account for the occluded obstacles, it incorporates adjustable risk regions that represent their potential future locations. Subsequently, dynamic risk boundary constraints are developed online to ensure safety. The CMPC then constructs multiple locally optimal trajectory branches (each tailored to different risk regions) to balance between exploitation and exploration. A shared consensus trunk is generated to ensure smooth transitions between branches without significant velocity fluctuations, further preserving motion consistency. To facilitate high computational efficiency and ensure coordination across local trajectories, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the CMPC into manageable sub-problems for parallel solving. The proposed strategy is validated through simulation and real-world experiments on an Ackermann-steering robot platform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CMPC strategy through comparisons with baseline approaches in occluded, obstacle-dense environments.</p></details> |  |

Verifying high-level task plans before execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan. Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems.

Accurately estimating an object's mass before interaction can significantly enhance the performance of various robotic tasks. However, mass estimation using only vision sensors is a relatively underexplored area. This paper proposes a novel approach combining sparse point-cloud data from depth images with RGB images to estimate the mass of objects. We evaluate a range of point-cloud processing architectures, alongside RGB-only methods. To overcome the limited availability of training data, we create a synthetic dataset using ShapeNetSem 3D models, simulating RGBD images via a Kinect camera. This synthetic data is used to train an image generation model for estimating dense depth maps, which we then use to augment an existing dataset of images paired with mass values. Our approach significantly outperforms existing benchmarks across all evaluated metrics. The data generation (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/ShapenetSem-to-RGBD) as well as the training of the depth estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/GLPDepth-Edited) and the mass estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/Depth-mass-estimator) are available online.</p></details> |  |

Solving these problems involves addressing nonlinear kinematics, complex contact dynamics, and long-horizon planning, each posing distinct challenges for state-of-the-art optimization methods. To efficiently solve a wide range of tasks across varying scenarios, researchers either develop specialized algorithms for the task to achieve, or switch between different frameworks. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a general-purpose decision-making tool that enables strategic exploration across problem instances without relying on task-specific structures. However, MCTS suffers from combinatorial complexity, leading to slow convergence and high memory usage. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Tensor Train Tree Search} (TTTS), which leverages tensor factorization to exploit the separable structure of decision trees. This yields a low-rank, linear-complexity representation that significantly reduces both computation time and storage requirements. We prove that TTTS can efficiently reach the bounded global optimum within a finite time. Experimental results across inverse kinematics, motion planning around obstacles, multi-stage motion planning, and bimanual whole-body manipulation demonstrate the efficiency of TTTS on a diverse set of robotic tasks.</p></details> | 46 pages, 8 figures |

Rather than requiring access to internal robot systems, our approach mounts a smartphone equipped with a camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the robot, making it applicable to any commercial robot without hardware modifications. The system estimates robot poses through neural inertial navigation and efficiently captures images at regular spatial intervals throughout the cleaning task. We develop a novel test-time data augmentation method called Rotation-Augmented Ensemble (RAE) to mitigate domain gaps in neural inertial navigation. A loop closure method that exploits robot cleaning patterns further refines these estimated poses. We demonstrate the system with an object mapping application that analyzes captured images to geo-localize objects in the environment. Experimental evaluation in retail environments shows that our approach achieves 0.83 m relative pose error for robot localization and 0.97 m positional error for object mapping of over 100 items.</p></details> |  |

MOSU addresses the outdoor robot navigation challenge by integrating geometric, semantic, and contextual information to ensure comprehensive scene understanding. The system combines GPS and QGIS map-based routing for high-level global path planning and multi-modal trajectory generation for local navigation refinement. For trajectory generation, MOSU leverages multi-modalities: LiDAR-based geometric data for precise obstacle avoidance, image-based semantic segmentation for traversability assessment, and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to capture social context and enable the robot to adhere to social norms in complex environments. This multi-modal integration improves scene understanding and enhances traversability, allowing the robot to adapt to diverse outdoor conditions. We evaluate our system in real-world on-road environments and benchmark it on the GND dataset, achieving a 10% improvement in traversability on navigable terrains while maintaining a comparable navigation distance to existing global navigation methods.</p></details> |  |

We propose a new RL framework with ReflexNet for low-level task execution, SchemaPlanner for symbolic reasoning, and HyperOptima for long-term context modeling, ensuring continuous adaptation and memory retention. Experimental results show that DRAE significantly outperforms baseline approaches in long-term task retention and knowledge reuse, achieving an average task success rate of 82.5% across a set of dynamic robotic manipulation tasks, compared to 74.2% for traditional MoE models. Furthermore, DRAE maintains an extremely low forgetting rate, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in catastrophic forgetting mitigation.

The key challenge lies in the significant uncertainty in drag and weight parameters introduced by the collected litter. We propose a dynamical model for the coupled UUV-USV system in the primary plane of motion and a risk-aware optimization approach incorporating parameter uncertainty and noise to ensure safe interactions with the environment. A stochastic optimization problem is solved using a conditional value-at-risk framework.

To address these issues, we propose an Intent-Driven Adaptive Generalized Collaboration (IDAGC) framework that leverages multimodal data and human intent estimation to facilitate adaptive policy learning across multi-tasks in diverse scenarios, thereby facilitating autonomous inference of collaboration modes and dynamic adjustment of robotic actions. This framework overcomes the limitations of existing HRC methods, which are typically restricted to a single collaboration mode and lack the capacity to identify and transition between diverse states. Central to our framework is a predictive model that captures the interdependencies among vision, language, force, and robot state data to accurately recognize human intentions with a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and automatically switch collaboration modes. By employing dedicated encoders for each modality and integrating extracted features through a Transformer decoder, the framework efficiently learns multi-task policies, while force data optimizes compliance control and intent estimation accuracy during physical interactions. Experiments highlights our framework's practical potential to advance the comprehensive development of HRC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a fitness function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes a deformation for the previous trajectory with the current denoising process, allows anytime refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI. In a 2D holonomic case with 16 robots, it is almost twice as fast. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[SimLauncher: Launching Sample-Efficient Real-world Robotic Reinforcement Learning via Simulation Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04452v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection, while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment, which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic RL.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving precise stimulation over prolonged sessions poses significant challenges. By integrating advanced robotics with conventional TMS, robot-assisted TMS (Robo-TMS) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance efficacy and streamline procedures. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive review from an engineering perspective has been notably absent. This paper systematically examines four critical aspects of Robo-TMS: hardware and integration, calibration and registration, neuronavigation systems, and control systems. We review state-of-the-art technologies in each area, identify current limitations, and propose future research directions. Our findings suggest that broader clinical adoption of Robo-TMS is currently limited by unverified clinical applicability, high operational complexity, and substantial implementation costs. Emerging technologies, including marker-less tracking, non-rigid registration, learning-based electric field (E-field) modelling, individualised magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) generation, robot-assisted multi-locus TMS (Robo-mTMS), and automated calibration and registration, present promising pathways to address these challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering</p></details> |

To further increase the efficiency in these environments, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework that systematically schedules and coordinates dual-arm harvesting tasks, minimizing the overall harvesting makespan based on pre-mapped fruit locations. Specifically, we focus on a specialized dual-arm harvesting robot and employ pose coverage analysis of its end effector to maximize picking reachability. Additionally, we compare the performance of the dual-arm configuration with that of a single-arm vehicle, demonstrating that the dual-arm system can nearly double efficiency when fruit densities are roughly equal on both sides. Extensive simulations show a 10-20% increase in throughput and a significant reduction in the number of stops compared to non-optimized methods. These results underscore the advantages of an optimal scheduling approach in improving the scalability and efficiency of robotic harvesting in plant factories.</p></details> |  |

The design of these wire arrangements has traditionally been done empirically, but it becomes extremely challenging when dealing with complex structures. Various studies have attempted to optimize wire arrangement, but many of them have oversimplified the problem by imposing conditions such as restricting movements to a 2D plane, keeping the moment arm constant, or neglecting wire crossings. Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional wire arrangement optimization that takes wire crossings into account. We explore wire arrangements through a multi-objective black-box optimization method that ensures wires do not cross while providing sufficient joint torque along a defined target trajectory. For a 3D link structure, we optimize the wire arrangement under various conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness, and discuss the obtained design solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS2025, Website - https://haraduka.github.io/muscle-3d-opt/ , YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy510s-kOaY</p></details> |

Using a Unity-ROS simulation, it compares three agents: a human operator, an immersive VR-controlled robot, and a non-immersive VR-controlled robot. During the scanning phase, humans perform best due to agility and control speed. However, in the treatment phase, immersive VR robots outperform others, completing tasks up to 65% faster by using stored infection data and optimized path planning. In yield-map-based navigation, immersive robots are also 38% faster than humans. Despite slower performance in manual scanning tasks, immersive VR excels in memory-guided, repetitive operations. The study highlights the role of interface design and path optimization, noting limitations in simulation fidelity and generalizability. It concludes that immersive VR has strong potential to enhance efficiency and precision in precision agriculture.</p></details> |  |

The system utilizes a structured Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow that combines transformer-based long dialogue summarization, leadership style modeling, and user response analysis, enabling scalable evaluation of social robots in complex human-robot interaction (HRI) settings. Unlike prior work that focuses on static or task-oriented HRI, HyperSumm-RL captures and hypertextually organizes dynamic conversational exchanges into navigable, semantically rich representations which allows researchers to trace interaction threads, identify influence cues, and analyze leadership framing over time. The contributions of this study are threefold: (1) we present a novel infrastructure for summarizing and linking long, multi-turn dialogues using leadership-style taxonomies; (2) we propose an interactive hypertext model that supports relational navigation across conversational themes, participant responses, and robot behavior modes; and (3) we demonstrate the utility of this system in interpreting participant trust, engagement, and expectation shifts during social robot leadership scenarios. The findings reveal how hypertextual workflows can augment HRI research by enabling transparent, interpretable, and semantically grounded analysis of emergent social dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages with references</p></details> |

Robots offer an attractive alternative. This paper presents TeachingBot, an adaptive robotic system that teaches handwriting to human learners through physical interaction. Robot teaching poses two major challenges: (i) adapting to the individual handwriting style of the learner and (ii) maintaining an engaging learning experience. For the first challenge, TeachingBot uses a probabilistic model to capture the learner's writing style from their writing samples. Drawing on the insight that effective teaching balances standardization with individuality, the system generates a personalized teaching trajectory that aligns with the learner's natural writing. For the second challenge, TeachingBot employs variable impedance control to guide the learner, dynamically adjusting the strength of physical guidance based on the learner's performance. Human-subject experiments with 15 participants demonstrate the effectiveness of TeachingBot, showing clear improvement in learners' handwriting and engagement over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Coordination between heterogeneous units is paramount for precision tasks -- whether in manipulation, legged locomotion, or multi-robot interaction. Such modular systems introduce challenges far exceeding those in monolithic robot architectures. This study presents a robust method for synchronizing the trajectories of multiple heterogeneous actuators, adapting dynamically to system variations with minimal system knowledge. This design makes it inherently robot-agnostic, thus highly suited for modularity. To ensure smooth trajectory adherence, the multidimensional state is constrained within a hypersphere representing the allowable deviation. The distance metric can be adapted hence, depending on the task and system under control, deformation of the constraint region is possible. This approach is compatible with a wide range of robotic platforms and serves as a core interface for Motion-Stack, our new open-source universal framework for limb coordination (available at https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack ). The method is validated by synchronizing the end-effectors of six highly heterogeneous robotic limbs, evaluating both trajectory adherence and recovery from significant external disturbances.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 15 figures.

| **[Boundary Exploration of Next Best View Policy in 3D Robotic Scanning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10444v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Next Best View (NBV) problem is a pivotal challenge in 3D robotic scanning, with the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of object capture and reconstruction. Existing methods for determining the NBV often overlook view overlap, assume a fixed virtual origin for the camera, and rely on voxel-based representations of 3D data. To address these limitations and enhance the practicality of scanning unknown objects, we propose an NBV policy in which the next view explores the boundary of the scanned point cloud, with overlap intrinsically considered. The scanning or working distance of the camera is user-defined and remains flexible throughout the process. To this end, we first introduce a model-based approach in which candidate views are iteratively proposed based on a reference model. Scores are computed using a carefully designed strategy that accounts for both view overlap and convergence. In addition, we propose a learning-based method, the Boundary Exploration NBV Network (BENBV-Net), which predicts the NBV directly from the scanned data without requiring a reference model. BENBV-Net estimates scores for candidate boundaries, selecting the one with the highest score as the target for the next best view. It offers a significant improvement in NBV generation speed while maintaining the performance level of the model-based approach. We evaluate both methods on the ShapeNet, ModelNet, and 3D Repository datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of scanning efficiency, final coverage, and overlap stability, all of which are critical for practical 3D scanning applications.

Given a language command and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://rigvid-robot.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Multi-robot Aerial Soft Manipulator For Floating Litter Collection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03517v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Removing floating litter from water bodies is crucial to preserving aquatic ecosystems and preventing environmental pollution. In this work, we present a multi-robot aerial soft manipulator for floating litter collection, leveraging the capabilities of aerial robots. The proposed system consists of two aerial robots connected by a flexible rope manipulator, which collects floating litter using a hook-based tool. Compared to single-aerial-robot solutions, the use of two aerial robots increases payload capacity and flight endurance while reducing the downwash effect at the manipulation point, located at the midpoint of the rope. Additionally, we employ an optimization-based rope-shape planner to compute the desired rope shape. The planner incorporates an adaptive behavior that maximizes grasping capabilities near the litter while minimizing rope tension when farther away. The computed rope shape trajectory is controlled by a shape visual servoing controller, which approximates the rope as a parabola. The complete system is validated in outdoor experiments, demonstrating successful grasping operations. An ablation study highlights how the planner's adaptive mechanism improves the success rate of the operation. Furthermore, real-world tests in a water channel confirm the effectiveness of our system in floating litter collection. These results demonstrate the potential of aerial robots for autonomous litter removal in aquatic environments.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address the problem of inserting a hanger into various unseen garments that are initially laid flat on a table. This task is challenging due to its long-horizon nature, the high degrees of freedom of the garments and the lack of data. To simplify the learning process, we first propose breaking the task into several subtasks. Then, we formulate each subtask as a policy learning problem and propose a low-dimensional action parameterization. To overcome the challenge of limited data, we build our own simulator and create 144 synthetic clothing assets to effectively collect high-quality training data. Our approach uses single-view depth images and object masks as input, which mitigates the Sim2Real appearance gap and achieves high generalization capabilities for new garments. Extensive experiments in both simulation and reality validate our proposed method. By training on various garments in the simulator, our method achieves a 75\% success rate with 8 different unseen garments in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://pku-epic.github.io/RoboHanger/</p></details> |

However, existing solutions often rely on gestures or language commands, making interaction inefficient and ambiguous, particularly for users with physical impairments. In this paper, we introduce FAM-HRI, an efficient multi-modal framework for human-robot interaction that integrates language and gaze inputs via foundation models. By leveraging lightweight Meta ARIA glasses, our system captures real-time multi-modal signals and utilizes large language models (LLMs) to fuse user intention with scene context, enabling intuitive and precise robot manipulation. Our method accurately determines gaze fixation time interval, reducing noise caused by the gaze dynamic nature. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FAM-HRI achieves a high success rate in task execution while maintaining a low interaction time, providing a practical solution for individuals with limited physical mobility or motor impairments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ParticleFormer: A 3D Point Cloud World Model for Multi-Object, Multi-Material Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23126v3)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D world models (i.e., learning-based 3D dynamics models) offer a promising approach to generalizable robotic manipulation by capturing the underlying physics of environment evolution conditioned on robot actions. However, existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream visuomotor tasks.

| **[Learning Video Generation for Robotic Manipulation with Collaborative Trajectory Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01943v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further enabling fine-grained control. However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |
| **[Image-driven Robot Drawing with Rapid Lognormal Movements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03166v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large image generation and vision models, combined with differentiable rendering technologies, have become powerful tools for generating paths that can be drawn or painted by a robot. However, these tools often overlook the intrinsic physicality of the human drawing/writing act, which is usually executed with skillful hand/arm gestures. Taking this into account is important for the visual aesthetics of the results and for the development of closer and more intuitive artist-robot collaboration scenarios. We present a method that bridges this gap by enabling gradient-based optimization of natural human-like motions guided by cost functions defined in image space. To this end, we use the sigma-lognormal model of human hand/arm movements, with an adaptation that enables its use in conjunction with a differentiable vector graphics (DiffVG) renderer. We demonstrate how this pipeline can be used to generate feasible trajectories for a robot by combining image-driven objectives with a minimum-time smoothing criterion. We demonstrate applications with generation and robotic reproduction of synthetic graffiti as well as image abstraction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE RO-MAN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Gesture Recognition for Feedback Based Mixed Reality and Robotic Fabrication: A Case Study of the UnLog Tower](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19281v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed Reality (MR) platforms enable users to interact with three-dimensional holographic instructions during the assembly and fabrication of highly custom and parametric architectural constructions without the necessity of two-dimensional drawings. Previous MR fabrication projects have primarily relied on digital menus and custom buttons as the interface for user interaction with the MR environment. Despite this approach being widely adopted, it is limited in its ability to allow for direct human interaction with physical objects to modify fabrication instructions within the MR environment. This research integrates user interactions with physical objects through real-time gesture recognition as input to modify, update or generate new digital information enabling reciprocal stimuli between the physical and the virtual environment. Consequently, the digital environment is generative of the user's provided interaction with physical objects to allow seamless feedback in the fabrication process. This research investigates gesture recognition for feedback-based MR workflows for robotic fabrication, human assembly, and quality control in the construction of the UnLog Tower.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures.

| **[Making Physical Objects with Generative AI and Robotic Assembly: Considering Fabrication Constraints, Sustainability, Time, Functionality, and Accessibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19131v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D generative AI enables rapid and accessible creation of 3D models from text or image inputs. However, translating these outputs into physical objects remains a challenge due to the constraints in the physical world. Recent studies have focused on improving the capabilities of 3D generative AI to produce fabricable outputs, with 3D printing as the main fabrication method. However, this workshop paper calls for a broader perspective by considering how fabrication methods align with the capabilities of 3D generative AI. As a case study, we present a novel system using discrete robotic assembly and 3D generative AI to make physical objects. Through this work, we identified five key aspects to consider in a physical making process based on the capabilities of 3D generative AI. 1) Fabrication Constraints: Current text-to-3D models can generate a wide range of 3D designs, requiring fabrication methods that can adapt to the variability of generative AI outputs. 2) Time: While generative AI can generate 3D models in seconds, fabricating physical objects can take hours or even days. Faster production could enable a closer iterative design loop between humans and AI in the making process. 3) Sustainability: Although text-to-3D models can generate thousands of models in the digital world, extending this capability to the real world would be resource-intensive, unsustainable and irresponsible. 4) Functionality: Unlike digital outputs from 3D generative AI models, the fabrication method plays a crucial role in the usability of physical objects. 5) Accessibility: While generative AI simplifies 3D model creation, the need for fabrication equipment can limit participation, making AI-assisted creation less inclusive. These five key aspects provide a framework for assessing how well a physical making process aligns with the capabilities of 3D generative AI and values in the world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the CHI 2025 Workshop on Generative AI and HCI</p></details> |
| **[Towards autonomous photogrammetric forest inventory using a lightweight under-canopy robotic drone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12073v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drones are increasingly used in forestry to capture high-resolution remote sensing data, supporting enhanced monitoring, assessment, and decision-making processes. While operations above the forest canopy are already highly automated, flying inside forests remains challenging, primarily relying on manual piloting. Inside dense forests, reliance on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for localization is not feasible. Additionally, the drone must autonomously adjust its flight path to avoid collisions. Recently, advancements in robotics have enabled autonomous drone flights in GNSS-denied obstacle-rich areas. In this article, a step towards autonomous forest data collection is taken by building a prototype of a robotic under-canopy drone utilizing state-of-the-art open-source methods and validating its performance for data collection inside forests. Specifically, the study focused on camera-based autonomous flight under the forest canopy and photogrammetric post-processing of the data collected with the low-cost onboard stereo camera. The autonomous flight capability of the prototype was evaluated through multiple test flights at boreal forests. The tree parameter estimation capability was studied by performing diameter at breast height (DBH) estimation. The prototype successfully carried out flights in selected challenging forest environments, and the experiments showed excellent performance in forest 3D modeling with a miniaturized stereoscopic photogrammetric system. The DBH estimation achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.33 cm (12.79 \%) across all trees. For trees with a DBH less than 30 cm, the RMSE was 1.16 cm (5.74 \%). The results provide valuable insights into autonomous under-canopy forest mapping and highlight the critical next steps for advancing lightweight robotic drone systems for mapping complex forest environments.</p></details> | 36 pages, 11 Figures |

| **[HAPI: A Model for Learning Robot Facial Expressions from Human Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17046v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic robotic facial expression generation is crucial for human-robot interaction, as handcrafted methods based on fixed joint configurations often yield rigid and unnatural behaviors. Although recent automated techniques reduce the need for manual tuning, they tend to fall short by not adequately bridging the gap between human preferences and model predictions-resulting in a deficiency of nuanced and realistic expressions due to limited degrees of freedom and insufficient perceptual integration. In this work, we propose a novel learning-to-rank framework that leverages human feedback to address this discrepancy and enhanced the expressiveness of robotic faces. Specifically, we conduct pairwise comparison annotations to collect human preference data and develop the Human Affective Pairwise Impressions (HAPI) model, a Siamese RankNet-based approach that refines expression evaluation. Results obtained via Bayesian Optimization and online expression survey on a 35-DOF android platform demonstrate that our approach produces significantly more realistic and socially resonant expressions of Anger, Happiness, and Surprise than those generated by baseline and expert-designed methods. This confirms that our framework effectively bridges the gap between human preferences and model predictions while robustly aligning robotic expression generation with human affective responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

Although existing autoregressive VLA methods design a specific architecture like dual-system to leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they tend to capture static information, often neglecting the dynamic aspects vital for embodied tasks. To this end, we propose TriVLA, a unified Vision-Language-Action model with a triple-system architecture for general robot control. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The dynamics perception module (System 3) inherently produces visual representations that encompass both current static information and predicted future dynamics, thereby providing valuable guidance for policy learning. TriVLA utilizes pre-trained VLM model and fine-tunes pre-trained video foundation model on robot datasets along with internet human manipulation data. The subsequent policy learning module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that TriVLA operates at approximately 36 Hz and surpasses state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks as well as challenging real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Using data collected from RoboCup competitions, the model predicts joint command trajectories from multi-modal sensor inputs, including vision, proprioception, and game state. We employ a distillation technique to enable real-time inference on embedded platforms that reduces the multi-step diffusion process to a single step. Our results demonstrate the model's ability to replicate complex motion behaviors such as walking, kicking, and fall recovery both in simulation and on physical robots. Although high-level tactical behavior remains limited, this work provides a robust foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning or preference optimization methods.
