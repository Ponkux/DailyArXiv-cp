| **[Neural Brain: A Neuroscience-inspired Framework for Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07634v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted from static, data-driven models to dynamic systems capable of perceiving and interacting with real-world environments. Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 17 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

This contribution introduces RAI - a framework for creating embodied Multi Agent Systems for robotics. The proposed framework implements tools for Agents' integration with robotic stacks, Large Language Models, and simulations. It provides out-of-the-box integration with state-of-the-art systems like ROS 2. It also comes with dedicated mechanisms for the embodiment of Agents. These mechanisms have been tested on a physical robot, Husarion ROSBot XL, which was coupled with its digital twin, for rapid prototyping. Furthermore, these mechanisms have been deployed in two simulations: (1) robot arm manipulator and (2) tractor controller. All of these deployments have been evaluated in terms of their control capabilities, effectiveness of embodiment, and perception ability. The proposed framework has been used successfully to build systems with multiple agents. It has demonstrated effectiveness in all the aforementioned tasks. It also enabled identifying and addressing the shortcomings of the generative models used for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to 23rd International Conference on Practical applications of Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (PAAMS'25)</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Collaborative Mechanisms Between Large and Small Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07460v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful AI capabilities but face deployment challenges due to high resource costs and latency, whereas Small Language Models (SLMs) offer efficiency and deployability at the cost of reduced performance. Collaboration between LLMs and SLMs emerges as a crucial paradigm to synergistically balance these trade-offs, enabling advanced AI applications, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-SLM collaboration, detailing various interaction mechanisms (pipeline, routing, auxiliary, distillation, fusion), key enabling technologies, and diverse application scenarios driven by on-device needs like low latency, privacy, personalization, and offline operation. While highlighting the significant potential for creating more efficient, adaptable, and accessible AI, we also discuss persistent challenges including system overhead, inter-model consistency, robust task allocation, evaluation complexity, and security/privacy concerns. Future directions point towards more intelligent adaptive frameworks, deeper model fusion, and expansion into multimodal and embodied AI, positioning LLM-SLM collaboration as a key driver for the next generation of practical and ubiquitous artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPT-Bench: A Large-Scale, Long-Term and Robot-Egocentric Dataset for Benchmarking Target Person Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07446v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking a target person from robot-egocentric views is crucial for developing autonomous robots that provide continuous personalized assistance or collaboration in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Embodied AI. However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoptic, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 35 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |
| **[GeoNav: Empowering MLLMs with Explicit Geospatial Reasoning Abilities for Language-Goal Aerial Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09587v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-goal aerial navigation is a critical challenge in embodied AI, requiring UAVs to localize targets in complex environments such as urban blocks based on textual specification. Existing methods, often adapted from indoor navigation, struggle to scale due to limited field of view, semantic ambiguity among objects, and lack of structured spatial reasoning. In this work, we propose GeoNav, a geospatially aware multimodal agent to enable long-range navigation. GeoNav operates in three phases-landmark navigation, target search, and precise localization-mimicking human coarse-to-fine spatial strategies. To support such reasoning, it dynamically builds two different types of spatial memory. The first is a global but schematic cognitive map, which fuses prior textual geographic knowledge and embodied visual cues into a top-down, annotated form for fast navigation to the landmark region. The second is a local but delicate scene graph representing hierarchical spatial relationships between blocks, landmarks, and objects, which is used for definite target localization. On top of this structured representation, GeoNav employs a spatially aware, multimodal chain-of-thought prompting mechanism to enable multimodal large language models with efficient and interpretable decision-making across stages. On the CityNav urban navigation benchmark, GeoNav surpasses the current state-of-the-art by up to 12.53% in success rate and significantly improves navigation efficiency, even in hard-level tasks. Ablation studies highlight the importance of each module, showcasing how geospatial representations and coarse-to-fine reasoning enhance UAV navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Agentic AI Networking in 6G: A Generative Foundation Model-as-Agent Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15764v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The promising potential of AI and network convergence in improving networking performance and enabling new service capabilities has recently attracted significant interest. Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |
| **[ACORN: Adaptive Contrastive Optimization for Safe and Robust Fine-Grained Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06628v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI research has traditionally emphasized performance metrics such as success rate and cumulative reward, overlooking critical robustness and safety considerations that emerge during real-world deployment. In actual environments, agents continuously encounter unpredicted situations and distribution shifts, causing seemingly reliable policies to experience catastrophic failures, particularly in manipulation tasks. To address this gap, we introduce four novel safety-centric metrics that quantify an agent's resilience to environmental perturbations. Building on these metrics, we present Adaptive Contrastive Optimization for Robust Manipulation (ACORN), a plug-and-play algorithm that enhances policy robustness without sacrificing performance. ACORN leverages contrastive learning to simultaneously align trajectories with expert demonstrations while diverging from potentially unsafe behaviors. Our approach efficiently generates informative negative samples through structured Gaussian noise injection, employing a double perturbation technique that maintains sample diversity while minimizing computational overhead. Comprehensive experiments across diverse manipulation environments validate ACORN's effectiveness, yielding improvements of up to 23% in safety metrics under disturbance compared to baseline methods. These findings underscore ACORN's significant potential for enabling reliable deployment of embodied agents in safety-critical real-world applications.</p></details> | 6 pages,4 figures |
| **[GRACE: Estimating Geometry-level 3D Human-Scene Contact from 2D Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06575v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the geometry level of human-scene contact aims to ground specific contact surface points at 3D human geometries, which provides a spatial prior and bridges the interaction between human and scene, supporting applications such as human behavior analysis, embodied AI, and AR/VR. To complete the task, existing approaches predominantly rely on parametric human models (e.g., SMPL), which establish correspondences between images and contact regions through fixed SMPL vertex sequences. This actually completes the mapping from image features to an ordered sequence. However, this approach lacks consideration of geometry, limiting its generalizability in distinct human geometries. In this paper, we introduce GRACE (Geometry-level Reasoning for 3D Human-scene Contact Estimation), a new paradigm for 3D human contact estimation. GRACE incorporates a point cloud encoder-decoder architecture along with a hierarchical feature extraction and fusion module, enabling the effective integration of 3D human geometric structures with 2D interaction semantics derived from images. Guided by visual cues, GRACE establishes an implicit mapping from geometric features to the vertex space of the 3D human mesh, thereby achieving accurate modeling of contact regions. This design ensures high prediction accuracy and endows the framework with strong generalization capability across diverse human geometries. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that GRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance in contact estimation, with additional results further validating its robust generalization to unstructured human point clouds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-LSTM based Multi-Agent DRL with Computation-aware Pruning for Agent Twins Migration in Vehicular Embodied AI Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06378v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of large language models and embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the intelligent transportation scenarios, the combination of them in intelligent transportation spawns the Vehicular Embodied AI Network (VEANs). In VEANs, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are typical agents whose local advanced AI applications are defined as vehicular embodied AI agents, enabling capabilities such as environment perception and multi-agent collaboration. Due to computation latency and resource constraints, the local AI applications and services running on vehicular embodied AI agents need to be migrated, and subsequently referred to as vehicular embodied AI agent twins, which drive the advancement of vehicular embodied AI networks to offload intensive tasks to Roadside Units (RSUs), mitigating latency problems while maintaining service quality. Recognizing workload imbalance among RSUs in traditional approaches, we model AV-RSU interactions as a Stackelberg game to optimize bandwidth resource allocation for efficient migration. A Tiny Multi-Agent Bidirectional LSTM Proximal Policy Optimization (TMABLPPO) algorithm is designed to approximate the Stackelberg equilibrium through decentralized coordination. Furthermore, a personalized neural network pruning algorithm based on Path eXclusion (PX) dynamically adapts to heterogeneous AV computation capabilities by identifying task-critical parameters in trained models, reducing model complexity with less performance degradation. Experimental validation confirms the algorithm's effectiveness in balancing system load and minimizing delays, demonstrating significant improvements in vehicular embodied AI agent deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[CityNavAgent: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation with Hierarchical Semantic Planning and Global Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05622v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial vision-and-language navigation (VLN), requiring drones to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex urban environments, emerges as a critical embodied AI challenge that bridges human-robot interaction, 3D spatial reasoning, and real-world deployment. Although existing ground VLN agents achieved notable results in indoor and outdoor settings, they struggle in aerial VLN due to the absence of predefined navigation graphs and the exponentially expanding action space in long-horizon exploration. In this work, we propose \textbf{CityNavAgent}, a large language model (LLM)-empowered agent that significantly reduces the navigation complexity for urban aerial VLN. Specifically, we design a hierarchical semantic planning module (HSPM) that decomposes the long-horizon task into sub-goals with different semantic levels. The agent reaches the target progressively by achieving sub-goals with different capacities of the LLM. Additionally, a global memory module storing historical trajectories into a topological graph is developed to simplify navigation for visited targets. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvement. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of different modules of CityNavAgent for aerial VLN in continuous city environments.

| **[3D Scene Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05474v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene generation seeks to synthesize spatially structured, semantically meaningful, and photorealistic environments for applications such as immersive media, robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied AI. Early methods based on procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations, trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets, evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations, and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity, physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D vision, and embodied intelligence.

| **[SITE: towards Spatial Intelligence Thorough Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05456v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence (SI) represents a cognitive ability encompassing the visualization, manipulation, and reasoning about spatial relationships, underpinning disciplines from neuroscience to robotics. We introduce SITE, a benchmark dataset towards SI Thorough Evaluation in a standardized format of multi-choice visual question-answering, designed to assess large vision-language models' spatial intelligence across diverse visual modalities (single-image, multi-image, and video) and SI factors (figural to environmental scales, spatial visualization and orientation, intrinsic and extrinsic, static and dynamic). Our approach to curating the benchmark combines a bottom-up survey about 31 existing datasets and a top-down strategy drawing upon three classification systems in cognitive science, which prompt us to design two novel types of tasks about view-taking and dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments reveal that leading models fall behind human experts especially in spatial orientation, a fundamental SI factor. Moreover, we demonstrate a positive correlation between a model's spatial reasoning proficiency and its performance on an embodied AI task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Embodied AI: Advances and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05108v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[RobotxR1: Enabling Embodied Robotic Intelligence on Large Language Models through Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03238v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future robotic systems operating in real-world environments will require on-board embodied intelligence without continuous cloud connection, balancing capabilities with constraints on computational power and memory. This work presents an extension of the R1-zero approach, which enables the usage of low parameter-count Large Language Models (LLMs) in the robotic domain. The R1-Zero approach was originally developed to enable mathematical reasoning in LLMs using static datasets. We extend it to the robotics domain through integration in a closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. This extension enhances reasoning in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) settings without relying solely on distillation of large models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We show that small-scale LLMs can achieve effective reasoning performance by learning through closed-loop interaction with their environment, which enables tasks that previously required significantly larger models. In an autonomous driving setting, a performance gain of 20.2%-points over the SFT-based baseline is observed with a Qwen2.5-1.5B model. Using the proposed training procedure, Qwen2.5-3B achieves a 63.3% control adaptability score, surpassing the 58.5% obtained by the much larger, cloud-bound GPT-4o. These results highlight that practical, on-board deployment of small LLMs is not only feasible but can outperform larger models if trained through environmental feedback, underscoring the importance of an interactive learning framework for robotic Embodied AI, one grounded in practical experience rather than static supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scenethesis: A Language and Vision Agentic Framework for 3D Scene Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02836v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing interactive 3D scenes from text is essential for gaming, virtual reality, and embodied AI. However, existing methods face several challenges. Learning-based approaches depend on small-scale indoor datasets, limiting the scene diversity and layout complexity. While large language models (LLMs) can leverage diverse text-domain knowledge, they struggle with spatial realism, often producing unnatural object placements that fail to respect common sense. Our key insight is that vision perception can bridge this gap by providing realistic spatial guidance that LLMs lack. To this end, we introduce Scenethesis, a training-free agentic framework that integrates LLM-based scene planning with vision-guided layout refinement. Given a text prompt, Scenethesis first employs an LLM to draft a coarse layout. A vision module then refines it by generating an image guidance and extracting scene structure to capture inter-object relations. Next, an optimization module iteratively enforces accurate pose alignment and physical plausibility, preventing artifacts like object penetration and instability. Finally, a judge module verifies spatial coherence. Comprehensive experiments show that Scenethesis generates diverse, realistic, and physically plausible 3D interactive scenes, making it valuable for virtual content creation, simulation environments, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaScenes: Towards Automated Replica Creation for Real-world 3D Scans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02388v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI (EAI) research requires high-quality, diverse 3D scenes to effectively support skill acquisition, sim-to-real transfer, and generalization. Achieving these quality standards, however, necessitates the precise replication of real-world object diversity. Existing datasets demonstrate that this process heavily relies on artist-driven designs, which demand substantial human effort and present significant scalability challenges. To scalably produce realistic and interactive 3D scenes, we first present MetaScenes, a large-scale, simulatable 3D scene dataset constructed from real-world scans, which includes 15366 objects spanning 831 fine-grained categories. Then, we introduce Scan2Sim, a robust multi-modal alignment model, which enables the automated, high-quality replacement of assets, thereby eliminating the reliance on artist-driven designs for scaling 3D scenes. We further propose two benchmarks to evaluate MetaScenes: a detailed scene synthesis task focused on small item layouts for robotic manipulation and a domain transfer task in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) to validate cross-domain transfer. Results confirm MetaScene's potential to enhance EAI by supporting more generalizable agent learning and sim-to-real applications, introducing new possibilities for EAI research.

| **[Autonomous Embodied Agents: When Robotics Meets Deep Learning Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00935v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increase in available computing power and the Deep Learning revolution have allowed the exploration of new topics and frontiers in Artificial Intelligence research. A new field called Embodied Artificial Intelligence, which places at the intersection of Computer Vision, Robotics, and Decision Making, has been gaining importance during the last few years, as it aims to foster the development of smart autonomous robots and their deployment in society. The recent availability of large collections of 3D models for photorealistic robotic simulation has allowed faster and safe training of learning-based agents for millions of frames and a careful evaluation of their behavior before deploying the models on real robotic platforms. These intelligent agents are intended to perform a certain task in a possibly unknown environment. To this end, during the training in simulation, the agents learn to perform continuous interactions with the surroundings, such as gathering information from the environment, encoding and extracting useful cues for the task, and performing actions towards the final goal; where every action of the agent influences the interactions. This dissertation follows the complete creation process of embodied agents for indoor environments, from their concept to their implementation and deployment. We aim to contribute to research in Embodied AI and autonomous agents, in order to foster future work in this field. We present a detailed analysis of the procedure behind implementing an intelligent embodied agent, comprehending a thorough description of the current state-of-the-art in literature, technical explanations of the proposed methods, and accurate experimental studies on relevant robotic tasks.</p></details> | Ph.D. Dissertation |
| **[Towards Efficient Online Tuning of VLM Agents via Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03792v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online fine-tuning vision-language model (VLM) agents with reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for equipping agents with multi-step, goal-oriented capabilities in dynamic environments. However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains. The code is available at https://github.com/langfengQ/CoSo.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[A Survey of Robotic Navigation and Manipulation with Physics Simulators in the Era of Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01458v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation and manipulation are core capabilities in Embodied AI, yet training agents with these capabilities in the real world faces high costs and time complexity. Therefore, sim-to-real transfer has emerged as a key approach, yet the sim-to-real gap persists. This survey examines how physics simulators address this gap by analyzing their properties overlooked in previous surveys. We also analyze their features for navigation and manipulation tasks, along with hardware requirements. Additionally, we offer a resource with benchmark datasets, metrics, simulation platforms, and cutting-edge methods-such as world models and geometric equivariance-to help researchers select suitable tools while accounting for hardware constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Trust Embodied Agents? Exploring Backdoor Attacks against Embodied LLM-based Decision-Making Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20774v3)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in real-world decision-making tasks for embodied artificial intelligence, especially when fine-tuned to leverage their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities while being tailored to specific applications. However, this fine-tuning process introduces considerable safety and security vulnerabilities, especially in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-based Decision-making systems (BALD) in embodied AI, systematically exploring the attack surfaces and trigger mechanisms. Specifically, we propose three distinct attack mechanisms: word injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection, targeting various components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline. We perform extensive experiments on representative LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2) in autonomous driving and home robot tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and stealthiness of our backdoor triggers across various attack channels, with cases like vehicles accelerating toward obstacles and robots placing knives on beds. Our word and knowledge injection attacks achieve nearly 100% success rate across multiple models and datasets while requiring only limited access to the system. Our scenario manipulation attack yields success rates exceeding 65%, reaching up to 90%, and does not require any runtime system intrusion. We also assess the robustness of these attacks against defenses, revealing their resilience. Our findings highlight critical security vulnerabilities in embodied LLM systems and emphasize the urgent need for safeguarding these systems to mitigate potential risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at ICLR 2025, 31 pages, including main paper, references, and appendix</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of Interactive Generative Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21853v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive Generative Video (IGV) has emerged as a crucial technology in response to the growing demand for high-quality, interactive video content across various domains. In this paper, we define IGV as a technology that combines generative capabilities to produce diverse high-quality video content with interactive features that enable user engagement through control signals and responsive feedback. We survey the current landscape of IGV applications, focusing on three major domains: 1) gaming, where IGV enables infinite exploration in virtual worlds; 2) embodied AI, where IGV serves as a physics-aware environment synthesizer for training agents in multimodal interaction with dynamically evolving scenes; and 3) autonomous driving, where IGV provides closed-loop simulation capabilities for safety-critical testing and validation. To guide future development, we propose a comprehensive framework that decomposes an ideal IGV system into five essential modules: Generation, Control, Memory, Dynamics, and Intelligence. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the technical challenges and future directions in realizing each component for an ideal IGV system, such as achieving real-time generation, enabling open-domain control, maintaining long-term coherence, simulating accurate physics, and integrating causal reasoning. We believe that this systematic analysis will facilitate future research and development in the field of IGV, ultimately advancing the technology toward more sophisticated and practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the computational demands of virtual services and the inherent mobility of autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitate real-time migration of Vehicular Embodied Agent AI Twins (VEAATs) between resource-constrained Roadside Units (RSUs). This paper proposes a novel framework for efficient VEAAT migration in VEANETs, combining a multi-leader multi-follower (MLMF) Stackelberg game-theoretic incentive mechanism with a tiny multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm. First, We propose an virtual immersive experience-driven utility model that captures AV-RSU dynamic interactions by integrating AVs' social influence, service complementarity and substitutability, and RSUs' resource allocation strategies to optimize VEAAT migration decisions. Second, to enhance training efficiency and enable efficient deployment on computation-constrained AVs while preserving exploration-exploitation performance, we propose TinyMA-IEI-PPO, a self-adaptive dynamic structured pruning algorithm that dynamically adjusts neuron importance based on agents' exploration incentives. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach achieves convergence comparable to baseline models and closely approximates the Stackelberg equilibrium.</p></details> |  |

| **[Personalized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) via Neuroscience-Inspired Continuous Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20109v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence has made remarkable advancements in recent years, primarily driven by increasingly large deep learning models. However, achieving true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) demands fundamentally new architectures rather than merely scaling up existing models. Current approaches largely depend on expanding model parameters, which improves task-specific performance but falls short in enabling continuous, adaptable, and generalized learning. Achieving AGI capable of continuous learning and personalization on resource-constrained edge devices is an even bigger challenge. This paper reviews the state of continual learning and neuroscience-inspired AI, and proposes a novel architecture for Personalized AGI that integrates brain-like learning mechanisms for edge deployment. We review literature on continuous lifelong learning, catastrophic forgetting, and edge AI, and discuss key neuroscience principles of human learning, including Synaptic Pruning, Hebbian plasticity, Sparse Coding, and Dual Memory Systems, as inspirations for AI systems. Building on these insights, we outline an AI architecture that features complementary fast-and-slow learning modules, synaptic self-optimization, and memory-efficient model updates to support on-device lifelong adaptation. Conceptual diagrams of the proposed architecture and learning processes are provided. We address challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, memory efficiency, and system scalability, and present application scenarios for mobile AI assistants and embodied AI systems like humanoid robots. We conclude with key takeaways and future research directions toward truly continual, personalized AGI on the edge. While the architecture is theoretical, it synthesizes diverse findings and offers a roadmap for future implementation.</p></details> | 39 pages, 16 figures |

However, deploying these systems remains challenging due to prolonged runtime latency, limited scalability, and heightened sensitivity, leading to significant system inefficiencies. In this paper, we aim to understand the workload characteristics of embodied agent systems and explore optimization solutions. We systematically categorize these systems into four paradigms and conduct benchmarking studies to evaluate their task performance and system efficiency across various modules, agent scales, and embodied tasks. Our benchmarking studies uncover critical challenges, such as prolonged planning and communication latency, redundant agent interactions, complex low-level control mechanisms, memory inconsistencies, exploding prompt lengths, sensitivity to self-correction and execution, sharp declines in success rates, and reduced collaboration efficiency as agent numbers increase. Leveraging these profiling insights, we suggest system optimization strategies to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of embodied agents across different paradigms. This paper presents the first system-level analysis of embodied AI agents, and explores opportunities for advancing future embodied system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS)</p></details> |

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

Although recent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their capabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and deformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the lack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under diverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for generating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac features a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional tactile sensors \sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip detection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips. Furthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis pipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based on this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm robotic system. Experiments demonstrate that PP-Tac can effectively grasp paper-like objects of varying material, thickness, and stiffness, achieving an overall success rate of 87.5\%. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to grasp paper-like deformable objects using a tactile dexterous hand.

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods, which predominantly depend on sparse 3D point clouds, exhibit limited generalizability and robustness due to their sensitivity to coordinate variations and the inherent sparsity of the data. By contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers high-fidelity, real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead by representing scenes as dense, continuous distributions. This positions 3DGS as a highly effective approach for capturing fine-grained affordance details and improving recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, its full potential remains largely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance datasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning. This dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances, and 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object categories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce AffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning using 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal structure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align 3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat dataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain, while AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen and unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first large-scale 3D Gaussians Affordance Reasoning Benchmark</p></details> |

In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control.

Traditional defense strategies, such as input filtering and output monitoring, often introduce high computational overhead or interfere with task performance in real-time embodied scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE), a novel defense framework that leverages representation engineering to enhance the safety of embodied LLMs by dynamically steering their internal activations. CEE operates by (1) extracting multilingual safety patterns from model activations, (2) constructing control directions based on safety-aligned concept subspaces, and (3) applying subspace concept rotation to reinforce safe behavior during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that CEE effectively mitigates jailbreak attacks while maintaining task performance, outperforming existing defense methods in both robustness and efficiency. This work contributes a scalable and interpretable safety mechanism for embodied AI, bridging the gap between theoretical representation engineering and practical security applications. Our findings highlight the potential of latent-space interventions as a viable defense paradigm against emerging adversarial threats in physically grounded AI systems.</p></details> |  |

These models efficiently generate action policies by learning to predict noise. However, conventional Diffusion Policy methods rely on iterative denoising, leading to inefficient inference and slow response times, which hinder real-time robot control. To address these limitations, we propose a Classifier-Free Shortcut Diffusion Policy (CF-SDP) that integrates classifier-free guidance with shortcut-based acceleration, enabling efficient task-specific action generation while significantly improving inference speed. Furthermore, we extend diffusion modeling to the SO(3) manifold in shortcut model, defining the forward and reverse processes in its tangent space with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. This ensures stable and accurate rotational estimation, enhancing the effectiveness of diffusion-based control. Our approach achieves nearly 5x acceleration in diffusion inference compared to DDIM-based Diffusion Policy while maintaining task performance. Evaluations both on the RoboTwin simulation platform and real-world scenarios across various tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 Workshop on 2nd MEIS</p></details> |

However, multi-granularity interaction remains a challenging task due to the ambiguity of language and degraded quality when it comes to queries upon object components. In this work, we present FMLGS, an approach that supports part-level open-vocabulary query within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We propose an efficient pipeline for building and querying consistent object- and part-level semantics based on Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). We designed a semantic deviation strategy to solve the problem of language ambiguity among object parts, which interpolates the semantic features of fine-grained targets for enriched information. Once trained, we can query both objects and their describable parts using natural language. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods prove that our method can not only better locate specified part-level targets, but also achieve first-place performance concerning both speed and accuracy, where FMLGS is 98 x faster than LERF, 4 x faster than LangSplat and 2.5 x faster than LEGaussians. Meanwhile, we further integrate FMLGS as a virtual agent that can interactively navigate through 3D scenes, locate targets, and respond to user demands through a chat interface, which demonstrates the potential of our work to be further expanded and applied in the future.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods.

Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

When humans grasp an object, appropriate trajectories naturally form in our minds to use it for specific tasks. Hand-object interaction trajectory priors can greatly benefit applications in robotics, embodied AI, augmented reality and related fields. However, synthesizing realistic and appropriate hand trajectories given a single object or hand-object interaction image is a highly ambiguous task, requiring to correctly identify the object of interest and possibly even the correct interaction among many possible alternatives. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose the SIGHT-Fusion system, consisting of a curated pipeline for extracting visual features of hand-object interaction details from egocentric videos involving object manipulation, and a diffusion-based conditional motion generation model processing the extracted features. We train our method given video data with corresponding hand trajectory annotations, without supervision in the form of action labels. For the evaluation, we establish benchmarks utilizing the first-person FPHAB and HOI4D datasets, testing our method against various baselines and using multiple metrics. We also introduce task simulators for executing the generated hand trajectories and reporting task success rates as an additional metric. Experiments show that our method generates more appropriate and realistic hand trajectories than baselines and presents promising generalization capability on unseen objects. The accuracy of the generated hand trajectories is confirmed in a physics simulation setting, showcasing the authenticity of the created sequences and their applicability in downstream uses.</p></details> |  |

We explore two alternative methods for sampling potential views and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulation and physical experiments.

Although Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)-based methods perform well in offline RL, their high computational and energy demands motivate exploration of more efficient alternatives. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) show promise for such tasks, given their low power consumption. In this work, we introduce DSFormer, the first spike-driven transformer model designed to tackle offline RL via sequence modeling. Unlike existing SNN transformers focused on spatial dimensions for vision tasks, we develop Temporal Spiking Self-Attention (TSSA) and Positional Spiking Self-Attention (PSSA) in DSFormer to capture the temporal and positional dependencies essential for sequence modeling in RL. Additionally, we propose Progressive Threshold-dependent Batch Normalization (PTBN), which combines the benefits of LayerNorm and BatchNorm to preserve temporal dependencies while maintaining the spiking nature of SNNs. Comprehensive results in the D4RL benchmark show DSFormer's superiority over both SNN and ANN counterparts, achieving 78.4% energy savings, highlighting DSFormer's advantages not only in energy efficiency but also in competitive performance.

Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Despite encouraging progress, current methods mainly focus on developing separate controllers, each specialized for a specific interaction task. This significantly hinders the ability to tackle a wide variety of challenging HSI tasks that require the integration of multiple skills, e.g., sitting down while carrying an object. To address this issue, we present TokenHSI, a single, unified transformer-based policy capable of multi-skill unification and flexible adaptation. The key insight is to model the humanoid proprioception as a separate shared token and combine it with distinct task tokens via a masking mechanism. Such a unified policy enables effective knowledge sharing across skills, thereby facilitating the multi-task training. Moreover, our policy architecture supports variable length inputs, enabling flexible adaptation of learned skills to new scenarios. By training additional task tokenizers, we can not only modify the geometries of interaction targets but also coordinate multiple skills to address complex tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve versatility, adaptability, and extensibility in various HSI tasks.

However, current multimodal retrieval tasks lack sufficient complexity and demonstrate limited practical application value. It spires us to design Instance-Driven Multimodal Image Retrieval (IDMR), a novel task that requires models to retrieve images containing the same instance as a query image while matching a text-described scenario. Unlike existing retrieval tasks focused on global image similarity or category-level matching, IDMR demands fine-grained instance-level consistency across diverse contexts. To benchmark this capability, we develop IDMR-bench using real-world object tracking and first-person video data. Addressing the scarcity of training data, we propose a cross-domain synthesis method that creates 557K training samples by cropping objects from standard detection datasets. Our Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based retrieval model, trained on 1.2M samples, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both traditional benchmarks and our zero-shot IDMR-bench. Experimental results demonstrate previous models' limitations in instance-aware retrieval and highlight the potential of MLLM for advanced retrieval applications.

To address this, we propose a novel framework that bridges embodied cognition theory and agent systems by leveraging a formal characterization of image schemas, which are defined as recurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. By customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create a neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental conceptual structures.

Data-driven embodied AI algorithms demand precise, large-scale, human-like manipulation sequences, which are challenging to obtain with conventional reinforcement learning or real-world teleoperation. To address this, we introduce ManipTrans, a novel two-stage method for efficiently transferring human bimanual skills to dexterous robotic hands in simulation. ManipTrans first pre-trains a generalist trajectory imitator to mimic hand motion, then fine-tunes a specific residual module under interaction constraints, enabling efficient learning and accurate execution of complex bimanual tasks. Experiments show that ManipTrans surpasses state-of-the-art methods in success rate, fidelity, and efficiency. Leveraging ManipTrans, we transfer multiple hand-object datasets to robotic hands, creating DexManipNet, a large-scale dataset featuring previously unexplored tasks like pen capping and bottle unscrewing. DexManipNet comprises 3.3K episodes of robotic manipulation and is easily extensible, facilitating further policy training for dexterous hands and enabling real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Graphs as World Models for Semantic Material-Aware Obstacle Handling in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21232v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to infer the material properties of obstacles limits their decision-making capacity. While AVs rely on sensor systems such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar to detect obstacles, this study suggests combining sensors with a knowledge graph (KG)-based world model to improve AVs' comprehension of physical material qualities. Beyond sensor data, AVs can infer qualities such as malleability, density, and elasticity using a semantic KG that depicts the relationships between obstacles and their attributes. Using the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, we evaluated AV performance with and without KG integration. The findings demonstrate that the KG-based method improves obstacle management, which allows AVs to use material qualities to make better decisions about when to change lanes or apply emergency braking. For example, the KG-integrated AV changed lanes for hard impediments like traffic cones and successfully avoided collisions with flexible items such as plastic bags by passing over them. Compared to the control system, the KG framework demonstrated improved responsiveness to obstacles by resolving conflicting sensor data, causing emergency stops for 13.3% more cases. In addition, our method exhibits a 6.6% higher success rate in lane-changing maneuvers in experimental scenarios, particularly for larger, high-impact obstacles. While we focus particularly on autonomous driving, our work demonstrates the potential of KG-based world models to improve decision-making in embodied AI systems and scale to other domains, including robotics, healthcare, and environmental simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Reasoning Video Segmentation with Just-in-Time Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21056v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning segmentation (RS) aims to identify and segment objects of interest based on implicit text queries. As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI agents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring explicit step-by-step guidance. However, current RS approaches rely heavily on the visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs), leading to several major limitations. First, they struggle with queries that require multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex spatial/temporal relationships. Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which may require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs and may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Finally, being primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they scale poorly to online video data. To address these limitations, we propose an agent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS without LLM fine-tuning. Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time digital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- a LLM plans the construction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using specialist vision models. We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin as "just-in-time" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific information and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating every specialist model. The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin representation to identify target objects. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new comprehensive video reasoning segmentation benchmark comprising 200 videos with 895 implicit text queries. The benchmark spans three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal) with three different reasoning chain complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[DINeMo: Learning Neural Mesh Models with no 3D Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20220v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-level 3D/6D pose estimation is a crucial step towards comprehensive 3D scene understanding, which would enable a broad range of applications in robotics and embodied AI. Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

| **[DataPlatter: Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the DataPlatter method, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.</p></details> |  |

Following this trend, research integrating robots with AGI has become prominent. As various kinds of embodiments have been designed, adaptability to diverse embodiments will become important to AGI. We introduce a new challenge, termed "Body Discovery of Embodied AI", focusing on tasks of recognizing embodiments and summarizing neural signal functionality. The challenge encompasses the precise definition of an AI body and the intricate task of identifying embodiments in dynamic environments, where conventional approaches often prove inadequate. To address these challenges, we apply causal inference method and evaluate it by developing a simulator tailored for testing algorithms with virtual environments. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical testing, demonstrating their robust performance in various scenarios based on virtual environments.</p></details> |  |

In the context of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), RAG has proven invaluable by augmenting model outputs with supplementary, relevant information, thus improving their quality. Recently, the potential of RAG has extended beyond natural language processing, with emerging methods integrating retrieval-augmented strategies into the computer vision (CV) domain. These approaches aim to address the limitations of relying solely on internal model knowledge by incorporating authoritative external knowledge bases, thereby improving both the understanding and generation capabilities of vision models. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV, focusing on two main areas: (I) visual understanding and (II) visual generation. In the realm of visual understanding, we systematically review tasks ranging from basic image recognition to complex applications such as medical report generation and multimodal question answering. For visual content generation, we examine the application of RAG in tasks related to image, video, and 3D generation. Furthermore, we explore recent advancements in RAG for embodied AI, with a particular focus on applications in planning, task execution, multimodal perception, interaction, and specialized domains. Given that the integration of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV is still in its early stages, we also highlight the key limitations of current approaches and propose future research directions to drive the development of this promising area.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[NavCoT: Boosting LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation via Learning Disentangled Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07376v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and tailored 3D scene understanding designs. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZeroHSI: Zero-Shot 4D Human-Scene Interaction by Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18600v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-scene interaction (HSI) generation is crucial for applications in embodied AI, virtual reality, and robotics. Yet, existing methods cannot synthesize interactions in unseen environments such as in-the-wild scenes or reconstructed scenes, as they rely on paired 3D scenes and captured human motion data for training, which are unavailable for unseen environments. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis, eliminating the need for training on any MoCap data. Our key insight is to distill human-scene interactions from state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/ The first two authors contribute equally</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Training of Generalizable Visuomotor Policies via Control-Aware Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09258v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving generalization is one key challenge in embodied AI, where obtaining large-scale datasets across diverse scenarios is costly. Traditional weak augmentations, such as cropping and flipping, are insufficient for improving a model's performance in new environments. Existing data augmentation methods often disrupt task-relevant information in images, potentially degrading performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EAGLE, an efficient training framework for generalizable visuomotor policies that improves upon existing methods by (1) enhancing generalization by applying augmentation only to control-related regions identified through a self-supervised control-aware mask and (2) improving training stability and efficiency by distilling knowledge from an expert to a visuomotor student policy, which is then deployed to unseen environments without further fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on three domains, including the DMControl Generalization Benchmark, the enhanced Robot Manipulation Distraction Benchmark, and a long-sequential drawer-opening task, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KARMA's plug-and-play capability allows for seamless deployment on real-world robotic systems, such as mobile manipulation platforms.Through this plug-and-play memory system, KARMA significantly enhances the ability of embodied agents to generate coherent and contextually appropriate plans, making the execution of complex household tasks more efficient.

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities, their adaptation to 3D environments (3D-LLMs) remains in its early stages. A primary challenge is a lack of large-scale datasets with dense grounding between language and 3D scenes. We introduce 3D-GRAND, a pioneering large-scale dataset comprising 40,087 household scenes paired with 6.2 million densely-grounded scene-language instructions. Our results show that instruction tuning with 3D-GRAND significantly enhances grounding capabilities and reduces hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. As part of our contributions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark 3D-POPE to systematically evaluate hallucination in 3D-LLMs, enabling fair comparisons of models. Our experiments highlight a scaling effect between dataset size and 3D-LLM performance, emphasizing the importance of large-scale 3D-text datasets for embodied AI research. Our results demonstrate early signals for effective sim-to-real transfer, indicating that models trained on large synthetic data can perform well on real-world 3D scans.

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MoK-RAG, a novel multi-source RAG framework that implements a mixture of knowledge paths enhanced retrieval mechanism through functional partitioning of a large language model (LLM) corpus into distinct sections, enabling retrieval from multiple specialized knowledge paths. Applied to the generation of 3D simulated environments, our proposed MoK-RAG3D enhances this paradigm by partitioning 3D assets into distinct sections and organizing them based on a hierarchical knowledge tree structure. Different from previous methods that only use manual evaluation, we pioneered the introduction of automated evaluation methods for 3D scenes. Both automatic and human evaluations in our experiments demonstrate that MoK-RAG3D can assist Embodied AI agents in generating diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing works share two constraints: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. To bridge the gaps, we propose 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans, and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves.

Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.</p></details> |  |

We formulate a unified framework to tackle this task, and curate a challenging dataset of openable 3D objects that serves as a test bed for systematic evaluation. Our experiments benchmark methods from prior work, extended and improved methods, and simple yet effective heuristics for the S2O task. We find that turning static 3D objects into interactively openable counterparts is possible but that all methods struggle to generalize to realistic settings of the task, and we highlight promising future work directions. Our work enables efficient creation of interactive 3D objects for robotic manipulation and embodied AI tasks.</p></details> |  |

Many navigation approaches primarily define success by proximity to the target, often overlooking the necessity for optimal positioning that facilitates subsequent manipulation. To address this, we introduce MoMa-Kitchen, a benchmark dataset comprising over 100k samples that provide training data for models to learn optimal final navigation positions for seamless transition to manipulation. Our dataset includes affordance-grounded floor labels collected from diverse kitchen environments, in which robotic mobile manipulators of different models attempt to grasp target objects amidst clutter. Using a fully automated pipeline, we simulate diverse real-world scenarios and generate affordance labels for optimal manipulation positions. Visual data are collected from RGB-D inputs captured by a first-person view camera mounted on the robotic arm, ensuring consistency in viewpoint during data collection. We also develop a lightweight baseline model, NavAff, for navigation affordance grounding that demonstrates promising performance on the MoMa-Kitchen benchmark. Our approach enables models to learn affordance-based final positioning that accommodates different arm types and platform heights, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable integration of navigation and manipulation in embodied AI.

Recognizing continuous video activities poses considerable challenges due to the fast expansion of streaming video, which contains multi-scale and untrimmed activities. We introduce a novel system, CARS, to overcome these issues through adaptive video context modeling. Adaptive video context modeling refers to selectively maintaining activity-related features in temporal and spatial dimensions. CARS has two key designs. The first is an activity spatial feature extraction by eliminating irrelevant visual features while maintaining recognition accuracy. The second is an activity-aware state update introducing dynamic adaptability to better preserve the video context for multi-scale activity recognition. Our CARS runs at speeds $>$30 FPS on typical edge devices and outperforms all baselines by 1.2\% to 79.7\% in accuracy. Moreover, we explore applying CARS to a large video model as a video encoder. Experimental results show that our CARS can result in a 0.46-point enhancement (on a 5-point scale) on the in-distribution video activity dataset, and an improvement ranging from 1.19\% to 4\% on zero-shot video activity datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up.

| **[Long-horizon Embodied Planning with Implicit Logical Inference and Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15658v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon embodied planning underpins embodied AI. To accomplish long-horizon tasks, one of the most feasible ways is to decompose abstract instructions into a sequence of actionable steps. Foundation models still face logical errors and hallucinations in long-horizon planning, unless provided with highly relevant examples to the tasks. However, providing highly relevant examples for any random task is unpractical. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a novel framework for Real-time Long-horizon Embodied Planning. ReLEP can complete a wide range of long-horizon tasks without in-context examples by learning implicit logical inference through fine-tuning. The fine-tuned large vision-language model formulates plans as sequences of skill functions. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. When constructing the dataset, we considered the implicit logical relationships, enabling the model to learn implicit logical relationships and dispel hallucinations. Through comprehensive evaluations across various long-horizon tasks, ReLEP demonstrates high success rates and compliance to execution even on unseen tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

The high cost of commercial mobile manipulation robots significantly limits research in real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose AhaRobot, a low-cost and fully open-source dual-arm mobile manipulation robot system with a hardware cost of only $1,000 (excluding optional computational resources), which is less than 1/15 of the cost of popular mobile robots. The AhaRobot system consists of three components: (1) a novel low-cost hardware architecture primarily composed of off-the-shelf components, (2) an optimized control solution to enhance operational precision integrating dual-motor backlash control and static friction compensation, and (3) a simple remote teleoperation method RoboPilot. We use handles to control the dual arms and pedals for whole-body movement. The teleoperation process is low-burden and easy to operate, much like piloting. RoboPilot is designed for remote data collection in embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboPilot significantly enhances data collection efficiency in complex manipulation tasks, achieving a 30% increase compared to methods using 3D mouse and leader-follower systems. It also excels at completing extremely long-horizon tasks in one go. Furthermore, AhaRobot can be used to learn end-to-end policies and autonomously perform complex manipulation tasks, such as pen insertion and cleaning up the floor. We aim to build an affordable yet powerful platform to promote the development of embodied tasks on real devices, advancing more robust and reliable embodied AI.

Current screen based chat-bots do not take advantage of the the full-suite of natural inputs available in XR, including inward facing sensor data, instead they over-rely on explicit voice or text prompts, sometimes paired with multi-modal data dropped as part of the query. We propose a solution that leverages an attention framework that derives context implicitly from user actions, eye-gaze, and contextual memory within the XR environment. Our work minimizes the need for engineered explicit prompts, fostering grounded and intuitive interactions that glean user insights for the chat-bot.</p></details> |  |

The system leverages multiple RGBD cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Effectiveness of a Socratic Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning Method for Task Planning in Robotics, A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08174v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in reasoning with natural language. Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks. To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenFly: A Versatile Toolchain and Large-scale Benchmark for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents through an environment by leveraging both language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Interactive systems assist humans in these tasks, enabling applications in Embodied AI, human-robot interaction, and virtual reality. However, current methods in hand-object synthesis often neglect dynamics and focus on generating static grasps. The first part of this dissertation introduces dynamic grasp synthesis, where a hand grasps and moves an object to a target pose. We approach this task using physical simulation and reinforcement learning. We then extend this to bimanual manipulation and articulated objects, requiring fine-grained coordination between hands. In the second part of this dissertation, we study human-to-robot handovers. We integrate captured human motion into simulation and introduce a student-teacher framework that adapts to human behavior and transfers from sim to real. To overcome data scarcity, we generate synthetic interactions, increasing training diversity by 100x. Our user study finds no difference between policies trained on synthetic vs. real motions.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |

However, real-world datasets often lack sufficient data for training and evaluation, and synthetic datasets, while larger, lack acoustic realism. Consequently, neither effectively meets practical needs. To address this issue, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit based on the embodied AI simulation platform Habitat-sim, designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim supports multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level adjustments, enabling the creation of more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a benchmark dataset called SonicSet, utilizing LibriSpeech, Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K), Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to investigate the differences between synthetic and real-world data, we selected 5 hours of raw, non-reverberant data from the SonicSet validation set and recorded a real-world speech separation dataset, providing a reference for comparing SonicSet with other synthetic datasets. For speech enhancement, we utilized the real-world dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between SonicSet and existing synthetic datasets. The results indicate that models trained on SonicSet generalize better to real-world scenarios compared to other synthetic datasets.

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI.

Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development.

Affordance indicates where and how to grasp an object by taking its functionality into account, serving as the foundation for effective task-oriented grasping. However, current task-oriented methods often depend on extensive training data that is confined to specific tasks and objects, making it difficult to generalize to novel objects and complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce AffordGrasp, a novel open-vocabulary grasping framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) for in-context affordance reasoning. Unlike existing methods that rely on explicit task and object specifications, our approach infers tasks directly from implicit user instructions, enabling more intuitive and seamless human-robot interaction in everyday scenarios. Building on the reasoning outcomes, our framework identifies task-relevant objects and grounds their part-level affordances using a visual grounding module. This allows us to generate task-oriented grasp poses precisely within the affordance regions of the object, ensuring both functional and context-aware robotic manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. We believe our approach advances robotic manipulation techniques and contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://eqcy.github.io/affordgrasp/.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of prior magical grasp implementations at a fraction of the GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |

These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Pattern Recognition Letters.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, when powered by open LLMs, they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a multicomponent memory system. In Minecraft experiments, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks where traditional Voyager fails without GPT-4, collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items and achieving $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones, advancing from basic wood tools to advanced iron equipment. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated collaborative experiences.

Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |

We propose a taxonomy that categorizes EMAS by system architectures and embodiment modalities, emphasizing how collaboration spans both physical and virtual contexts. Central building blocks, perception, planning, communication, and feedback, are then analyzed to illustrate how generative techniques bolster system robustness and flexibility. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the transformative effects of integrating foundation models into embodied, multi-agent frameworks. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions, underlining the significant promise of EMAS to reshape the landscape of AI-driven collaboration.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Object-Centric Latent Action Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09680v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging vast amounts of internet video data for Embodied AI is currently bottle-necked by the lack of action annotations and the presence of action-correlated distractors. We propose a novel object-centric latent action learning approach, based on VideoSaur and LAPO, that employs self-supervised decomposition of scenes into object representations and annotates video data with proxy-action labels. This method effectively disentangles causal agent-object interactions from irrelevant background noise and reduces the performance degradation of latent action learning approaches caused by distractors. Our preliminary experiments with the Distracting Control Suite show that latent action pretraining based on object decompositions improve the quality of inferred latent actions by x2.7 and efficiency of downstream fine-tuning with a small set of labeled actions, increasing return by x2.6 on average.</p></details> | Preprint.

| **[POEX: Understanding and Mitigating Policy Executable Jailbreak Attacks against Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16633v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems are rapidly evolving due to the integration of LLMs as planning modules, which transform complex instructions into executable policies. However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

These advancements have led to an explosive increase in the demand for computational power, challenging the limits of Moore's Law. Optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing, faces significant challenges due to its high costs. To address this, various lithography simulators have been developed. However, many of these simulators are limited by their inadequate photoresist modeling capabilities. This paper presents TorchResist, an open-source, differentiable photoresist simulator.TorchResist employs an analytical approach to model the photoresist process, functioning as a white-box system with at most twenty interpretable parameters. Leveraging modern differentiable programming techniques and parallel computing on GPUs, TorchResist enables seamless co-optimization with other tools across multiple related tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that TorchResist achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing solutions.

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[LSceneLLM: Enhancing Large 3D Scene Understanding Using Adaptive Visual Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01292v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on 3D Vision-Language Models (3D-VLMs) is gaining increasing attention, which is crucial for developing embodied AI within 3D scenes, such as visual navigation and embodied question answering. Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefDrone: A Challenging Benchmark for Referring Expression Comprehension in Drone Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00392v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drones have become prevalent robotic platforms with diverse applications, showing significant potential in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI). Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code will be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |

This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions. This highlights the critical need for robust goal specification and safety frameworks before any physical implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected Version - Solved Some Issues with reference compilation by latex</p></details> |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

| **[Generative Molecular Design with Steerable and Granular Synthesizability Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08774v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizability in small molecule generative design remains a bottleneck. Existing works that do consider synthesizability can output predicted synthesis routes for generated molecules. However, there has been minimal attention in addressing the ease of synthesis and enabling flexibility to incorporate desired reaction constraints. In this work, we propose a small molecule generative design framework that enables steerable and granular synthesizability control. Generated molecules satisfy arbitrary multi-parameter optimization objectives with predicted synthesis routes containing pre-defined allowed reactions, while optionally avoiding others. One can also enforce that all reactions belong to a pre-defined set. We show the capability to mix-and-match these reaction constraints across the most common medicinal chemistry transformations. Next, we show how our framework can be used to valorize industrial byproducts towards de novo optimized molecules. Going further, we demonstrate how granular control over synthesizability constraints can loosely mimic virtual screening of ultra-large make-on-demand libraries. Using only a single GPU, we generate and dock 15k molecules to identify promising candidates in Freedom 4.0 constituting 142B make-on-demand molecules (assessing only 0.00001% of the library). Generated molecules satisfying the reaction constraints have > 90% exact match rate. Lastly, we benchmark our framework against recent synthesizability-constrained generative models and demonstrate the highest sample efficiency even when imposing the additional constraint that all molecules must be synthesizable from a single reaction type. The main theme is demonstrating that a pre-trained generalist molecular generative model can be incentivized to generate property-optimized small molecules under challenging synthesizability constraints through reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference Optimization for Combinatorial Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08735v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for neural combinatorial optimization, enabling models to learn heuristics that solve complex problems without requiring expert knowledge. Despite significant progress, existing RL approaches face challenges such as diminishing reward signals and inefficient exploration in vast combinatorial action spaces, leading to inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Preference Optimization, a novel method that transforms quantitative reward signals into qualitative preference signals via statistical comparison modeling, emphasizing the superiority among sampled solutions. Methodologically, by reparameterizing the reward function in terms of policy and utilizing preference models, we formulate an entropy-regularized RL objective that aligns the policy directly with preferences while avoiding intractable computations. Furthermore, we integrate local search techniques into the fine-tuning rather than post-processing to generate high-quality preference pairs, helping the policy escape local optima. Empirical results on various benchmarks, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and the Flexible Flow Shop Problem (FFSP), demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing RL algorithms, achieving superior convergence efficiency and solution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

These methodologies are applied in the supermarket context. The main purpose is to analyse efficient methods for the data-driven. Their possibility, potential and current challenges are taken into consideration in this report. By comparing the results in each model, the effectiveness of each algorithm is evaluated based on several key performance indicators, including forecast accuracy, adaptability to market changes, and overall impact on inventory costs and customer satisfaction levels. The data visualization tools and statistical metrics are the indicators for the comparisons and show some obvious trends and patterns that can guide decision-making in inventory management. These tools enable managers to not only track the performance of different algorithms in real-time but also to drill down into specific data points to understand the underlying causes of inventory fluctuations. This level of detail is crucial for pinpointing inefficiencies and areas for improvement within the supply chain.</p></details> |  |

However, the sample efficiency of RL is crucial, and to improve it, we combine a model-based RL algorithm with our published method that turns Koopman (e)NMPCs into automatically differentiable policies. We apply our approach to an eNMPC case study of a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) model from the literature. The approach outperforms benchmark methods, i.e., data-driven eNMPCs using models based on system identification without further RL tuning of the resulting policy, and neural network controllers trained with model-based RL, by achieving superior control performance and higher sample efficiency. Furthermore, utilizing partial prior knowledge about the system dynamics via physics-informed learning further increases sample efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Without clear feedback on actions at each step in sparse-reward setting, previous methods struggle with precise credit assignment among agents and effective exploration. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to deal with both credit assignment and exploration problems in reward-sparse domains. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm that calculates the Influence Scope of Agents (ISA) on states by taking specific value of the dimensions/attributes of states that can be influenced by individual agents. The mutual dependence between agents' actions and state attributes are then used to calculate the credit assignment and to delimit the exploration space for each individual agent. We then evaluate ISA in a variety of sparse-reward multi-agent scenarios. The results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Based on a popular maximum entropy criteria, our approach iteratively finds a weight improvement step and proposes a method to find an appropriate step size that ensures learned cost function features remain similar to the demonstrated trajectory features. In contrast to similar approaches, our algorithm can individually tune the effectiveness of each observation for the partition function and does not need a large sample set, enabling faster learning. We generate sample trajectories by solving an optimal control problem instead of random sampling, leading to more informative trajectories. The performance of our method is compared to two state of the art algorithms to demonstrate its benefits in several simulated environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenThinkIMG: Learning to Think with Images via Visual Tool Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08617v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While humans can flexibly leverage interactive visual cognition for complex problem-solving, enabling Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to learn similarly adaptive behaviors with visual tools remains challenging. A significant hurdle is the current lack of standardized infrastructure, which hinders integrating diverse tools, generating rich interaction data, and training robust agents effectively. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenThinkIMG, the first open-source, comprehensive end-to-end framework for tool-augmented LVLMs. It features standardized vision tool interfaces, scalable trajectory generation for policy initialization, and a flexible training environment. Furthermore, considering supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on static demonstrations offers limited policy generalization for dynamic tool invocation, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework V-ToolRL to train LVLMs to learn adaptive policies for invoking external vision tools. V-ToolRL enables LVLMs to autonomously discover optimal tool-usage strategies by directly optimizing for task success using feedback from tool interactions. We empirically validate V-ToolRL on challenging chart reasoning tasks. Our RL-trained agent, built upon a Qwen2-VL-2B, significantly outperforms its SFT-initialized counterpart (+28.83 points) and surpasses established supervised tool-learning baselines like Taco and CogCom by an average of +12.7 points. Notably, it also surpasses prominent closed-source models like GPT-4.1 by +8.68 accuracy points. We hope OpenThinkIMG can serve as a foundational framework for advancing dynamic, tool-augmented visual reasoning, helping the community develop AI agents that can genuinely "think with images".</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, despite its potential, traditional PbRL methods are often constrained by the indistinguishability of segments, which impedes the learning process. In this paper, we introduce Skill-Enhanced Preference Optimization Algorithm (S-EPOA), which addresses the segment indistinguishability issue by integrating skill mechanisms into the preference learning framework. Specifically, we first conduct the unsupervised pretraining to learn useful skills. Then, we propose a novel query selection mechanism to balance the information gain and distinguishability over the learned skill space. Experimental results on a range of tasks, including robotic manipulation and locomotion, demonstrate that S-EPOA significantly outperforms conventional PbRL methods in terms of both robustness and learning efficiency. The results highlight the effectiveness of skill-driven learning in overcoming the challenges posed by segment indistinguishability.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |
| **[Reinforcement Learning meets Masked Video Modeling : Trajectory-Guided Adaptive Token Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08561v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked video modeling~(MVM) has emerged as a highly effective pre-training strategy for visual foundation models, whereby the model reconstructs masked spatiotemporal tokens using information from visible tokens. However, a key challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy. Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors, optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in evaluating and enhancing multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Focusing on task-specific scenarios, from instruction following in diverse domains such as math and coding to complex conversational engagements in roleplay, healthcare, education, and even adversarial jailbreak settings, we systematically examine the challenges of maintaining context, coherence, fairness, and responsiveness over prolonged dialogues. The paper organizes current benchmarks and datasets into coherent categories that reflect the evolving landscape of multi-turn dialogue evaluation. In addition, we review a range of enhancement methodologies under multi-turn settings, including model-centric strategies (contextual learning, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and new architectures), external integration approaches (memory-augmented, retrieval-based methods, and knowledge graph), and agent-based techniques for collaborative interactions. Finally, we discuss open challenges and propose future directions for research to further advance the robustness and effectiveness of multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Related resources and papers are available at https://github.com/yubol-cmu/Awesome-Multi-Turn-LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive textual data have recently demonstrated outstanding performance in general tasks, introducing new research directions for opponent modeling. Some studies primarily focus on directly using LLMs to generate decisions based on the elaborate prompt context that incorporates opponent descriptions, while these approaches are limited to scenarios where LLMs possess adequate domain expertise. To address that, we introduce a two-stage Strategy-Augmented Planning (SAP) framework that significantly enhances the opponent exploitation capabilities of LLM-based agents by utilizing a critical component, the Strategy Evaluation Network (SEN). Specifically, in the offline stage, we construct an explicit strategy space and subsequently collect strategy-outcome pair data for training the SEN network. During the online phase, SAP dynamically recognizes the opponent's strategies and greedily exploits them by searching best response strategy on the well-trained SEN, finally translating strategy to a course of actions by carefully designed prompts. Experimental results show that SAP exhibits robust generalization capabilities, allowing it to perform effectively not only against previously encountered opponent strategies but also against novel, unseen strategies. In the MicroRTS environment, SAP achieves a 85.35\% performance improvement over baseline methods and matches the competitiveness of reinforcement learning approaches against state-of-the-art (SOTA) rule-based AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

Examples of use cases are autonomous exploration and modelling of unknown environments or assessing key variables in optimising large complex systems. In this paper, we analyse a Reinforcement Learning approach called Causal Curiosity, which aims to estimate as accurately and efficiently as possible, without directly measuring them, the value of factors that causally determine the dynamics of a system. Whilst the idea presents a pathway forward, measurement accuracy is the foundation of methodology effectiveness. Focusing on the current causal curiosity's robotic manipulator, we present for the first time a measurement accuracy analysis of the future potentials and current limitations of this technique and an analysis of its sensitivity and confounding factor disentanglement capability - crucial for causal analysis. As a result of our work, we promote proposals for an improved and efficient design of Causal Curiosity methods to be applied to real-world complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

However, organizing UAVs to form multi-hop networks in large-scale dynamic environments presents significant challenges, including limitations in algorithmic scalability and the vast exploration space required for coordinated decision-making. To address these issues, we propose MRLMN, a novel framework that integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and large language models (LLMs) to jointly optimize UAV agents toward achieving optimal networking performance. The framework incorporates a grouping strategy with reward decomposition to enhance algorithmic scalability and balance decision-making across UAVs. In addition, behavioral constraints are applied to selected key UAVs to improve the robustness of the network. Furthermore, the framework integrates LLM agents, leveraging knowledge distillation to transfer their high-level decision-making capabilities to MARL agents. This enhances both the efficiency of exploration and the overall training process. In the distillation module, a Hungarian algorithm-based matching scheme is applied to align the decision outputs of the LLM and MARL agents and define the distillation loss. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in network performance, including enhanced coverage and communication quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution Framework Centralized Enough for MARL?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17352v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has recently emerged as a popular framework for cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where agents can use additional global state information to guide training in a centralized way and make their own decisions only based on decentralized local policies. Despite the encouraging results achieved, CTDE makes an independence assumption on agent policies, which limits agents to adopt global cooperative information from each other during centralized training. Therefore, we argue that existing CTDE methods cannot fully utilize global information for training, leading to an inefficient joint-policy exploration and even suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce a novel Centralized Advising and Decentralized Pruning (CADP) framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning, that not only enables an efficacious message exchange among agents during training but also guarantees the independent policies for execution. Firstly, CADP endows agents the explicit communication channel to seek and take advices from different agents for more centralized training. To further ensure the decentralized execution, we propose a smooth model pruning mechanism to progressively constraint the agent communication into a closed one without degradation in agent cooperation capability. Empirical evaluations on StarCraft II micromanagement and Google Research Football benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, the upcoming IEEE 802.11bn amendment introduces multi-access point coordination (MAPC) methods. This paper addresses a variant of MAPC called coordinated spatial reuse (C-SR), where devices transmit simultaneously on the same channel, with the power adjusted to minimize interference. The C-SR scheduling problem is selecting which devices transmit concurrently and with what settings. We provide a theoretical upper bound model, optimized for either throughput or fairness, which finds the best possible transmission schedule using mixed-integer linear programming. Then, a practical, probing-based approach is proposed which uses multi-armed bandits (MABs), a type of reinforcement learning, to solve the C-SR scheduling problem. We validate both classical (flat) MAB and hierarchical MAB (H-MAB) schemes with simulations and in a testbed. Using H-MABs for C-SR improves aggregate throughput over legacy IEEE 802.11 (on average by 80\% in random scenarios), without reducing the number of transmission opportunities per station. Finally, our framework is lightweight and ready for implementation in Wi-Fi devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 18 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

While traditional methods rely on discrete grid-based representations, real-world UAV operations require power-efficient continuous motion planning. We formulate the UAV CPP problem in a continuous environment, minimizing power consumption while ensuring complete coverage. Our approach models the environment with variable-size axis-aligned rectangles and UAV motion with curvature-constrained B\'ezier curves. We train a reinforcement learning agent using an action-mapping-based Soft Actor-Critic (AM-SAC) algorithm employing a self-adaptive curriculum. Experiments on both procedurally generated and hand-crafted scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in learning energy-efficient coverage strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion Policy Optimization for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08376v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown the great potential of diffusion models in improving reinforcement learning (RL) by modeling complex policies, expressing a high degree of multi-modality, and efficiently handling high-dimensional continuous control tasks. However, there is currently limited research on how to optimize diffusion-based polices (e.g., Diffusion Policy) fast and stably. In this paper, we propose an Adam-based Diffusion Policy Optimization (ADPO), a fast algorithmic framework containing best practices for fine-tuning diffusion-based polices in robotic control tasks using the adaptive gradient descent method in RL. Adaptive gradient method is less studied in training RL, let alone diffusion-based policies. We confirm that ADPO outperforms other diffusion-based RL methods in terms of overall effectiveness for fine-tuning on standard robotic tasks. Concretely, we conduct extensive experiments on standard robotic control tasks to test ADPO, where, particularly, six popular diffusion-based RL methods are provided as benchmark methods. Experimental results show that ADPO acquires better or comparable performance than the baseline methods. Finally, we systematically analyze the sensitivity of multiple hyperparameters in standard robotics tasks, providing guidance for subsequent practical applications. Our video demonstrations are released in https://github.com/Timeless-lab/ADPO.git.</p></details> |  |

Drawing inspiration from key human learning strategies, we propose two novel strategies to enhance the capability of large language models to solve these complex problems. First, Adaptive Difficulty Curriculum Learning (ADCL) is a novel curriculum learning strategy that tackles the Difficulty Shift phenomenon (i.e., a model's perception of problem difficulty dynamically changes during training) by periodically re-estimating difficulty within upcoming data batches to maintain alignment with the model's evolving capabilities. Second, Expert-Guided Self-Reformulation (EGSR) is a novel reinforcement learning strategy that bridges the gap between imitation learning and pure exploration by guiding models to reformulate expert solutions within their own conceptual framework, rather than relying on direct imitation, fostering deeper understanding and knowledge assimilation. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using Qwen2.5-7B as the base model, demonstrate that these human-inspired strategies synergistically and significantly enhance performance. Notably, their combined application improves performance over the standard Zero-RL baseline by 10% on the AIME24 benchmark and 16.6% on AIME25.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figs |

Drawing inspiration from human compositional reasoning -- where known components are reconfigured to handle new situations -- we introduce World Modeling with Compositional Causal Components (WM3C). This novel framework enhances RL generalization by learning and leveraging compositional causal components. Unlike previous approaches focusing on invariant representation learning or meta-learning, WM3C identifies and utilizes causal dynamics among composable elements, facilitating robust adaptation to new tasks. Our approach integrates language as a compositional modality to decompose the latent space into meaningful components and provides theoretical guarantees for their unique identification under mild assumptions. Our practical implementation uses a masked autoencoder with mutual information constraints and adaptive sparsity regularization to capture high-level semantic information and effectively disentangle transition dynamics. Experiments on numerical simulations and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that WM3C significantly outperforms existing methods in identifying latent processes, improving policy learning, and generalizing to unseen tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[DPR: Diffusion Preference-based Reward for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01143v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) mitigates the need for reward definition, aligning with human preferences via preference-driven reward feedback without interacting with the environment. However, the effectiveness of preference-driven reward functions depends on the modeling ability of the learning model, which current MLP-based and Transformer-based methods may fail to adequately provide. To alleviate the failure of the reward function caused by insufficient modeling, we propose a novel preference-based reward acquisition method: Diffusion Preference-based Reward (DPR). Unlike previous methods using Bradley-Terry models for trajectory preferences, we use diffusion models to directly model preference distributions for state-action pairs, allowing rewards to be discriminatively obtained from these distributions. In addition, considering the particularity of preference data that only know the internal relationships of paired trajectories, we further propose Conditional Diffusion Preference-based Reward (C-DPR), which leverages relative preference information to enhance the construction of the diffusion model. We apply the above methods to existing offline reinforcement learning algorithms and a series of experiment results demonstrate that the diffusion-based reward acquisition approach outperforms previous MLP-based and Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Identifiable Cost-Aware Causal Decision-Making Framework Using Counterfactual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08343v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision making under abnormal conditions is a critical process that involves evaluating the current state and determining the optimal action to restore the system to a normal state at an acceptable cost. However, in such scenarios, existing decision-making frameworks highly rely on reinforcement learning or root cause analysis, resulting in them frequently neglecting the cost of the actions or failing to incorporate causal mechanisms adequately. By relaxing the existing causal decision framework to solve the necessary cause, we propose a minimum-cost causal decision (MiCCD) framework via counterfactual reasoning to address the above challenges. Emphasis is placed on making counterfactual reasoning processes identifiable in the presence of a large amount of mixed anomaly data, as well as finding the optimal intervention state in a continuous decision space. Specifically, it formulates a surrogate model based on causal graphs, using abnormal pattern clustering labels as supervisory signals. This enables the approximation of the structural causal model among the variables and lays a foundation for identifiable counterfactual reasoning. With the causal structure approximated, we then established an optimization model based on counterfactual estimation. The Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithm is further employed to optimize intervention strategies while taking costs into account. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets reveal that MiCCD outperforms conventional methods across multiple metrics, including F1-score, cost efficiency, and ranking quality(nDCG@k values), thus validating its efficacy and broad applicability.</p></details> |  |

An artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital twin (DT) architecture with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) using Deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is proposed for dynamic optimization of resource allocation. DT virtualizes network states to enable predictive analysis, while DRL changes bandwidth for eMBB slice.

The aim of distributional TD learning is to estimate the return distribution of a discounted Markov decision process for a given policy {\pi}. Previous works on statistical analysis of distributional TD learning mainly focus on the tabular case. In contrast, we first consider the linear function approximation setting and derive sharp finite-sample rates. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the sample complexity of linear distributional TD learning matches that of classic linear TD learning. This implies that, with linear function approximation, learning the full distribution of the return from streaming data is no more difficult than learning its expectation (value function). To derive tight sample complexity bounds, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of the linear-categorical Bellman equation and employ the exponential stability arguments for products of random matrices. Our results provide new insights into the statistical efficiency of distributional reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Outperforming DeepSeek-R1 and rivaling leading Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models like Qwen3-235B-A22B and Seed1.5-Thinking, AM-Thinking-v1 achieves impressive scores of 85.3 on AIME 2024, 74.4 on AIME 2025, and 70.3 on LiveCodeBench, showcasing state-of-the-art mathematical and coding capabilities among open-source models of similar scale. Built entirely from the open-source Qwen2.5-32B base model and publicly available queries, AM-Thinking-v1 leverages a meticulously crafted post-training pipeline - combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning - to deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities. This work demonstrates that the open-source community can achieve high performance at the 32B scale, a practical sweet spot for deployment and fine-tuning. By striking a balance between top-tier performance and real-world usability, we hope AM-Thinking-v1 inspires further collaborative efforts to harness mid-scale models, pushing reasoning boundaries while keeping accessibility at the core of innovation.

Yet, the question often remains: how should one computationally model a theory? We provide a demonstration of how formalisms taken from artificial intelligence can offer a fertile starting point. Specifically, we focus on the "need for competence", postulated as a key basic psychological need within Self-Determination Theory (SDT) -- arguably the most influential framework for intrinsic motivation (IM) in psychology. Recent research has identified multiple distinct facets of competence in key SDT texts: effectance, skill use, task performance, and capacity growth. We draw on the computational IM literature in reinforcement learning to suggest that different existing formalisms may be appropriate for modelling these different facets. Using these formalisms, we reveal underlying preconditions that SDT fails to make explicit, demonstrating how computational models can improve our understanding of IM. More generally, our work can support a cycle of theory development by inspiring new computational models, which can then be tested empirically to refine the theory. Thus, we provide a foundation for advancing competence-related theory in SDT and motivational psychology more broadly.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages plus references, full paper at CogSci 2025</p></details> |

However, the diversity of algorithms and the complexity of theoretical foundations often pose significant challenges for beginners seeking to enter the field. This tutorial aims to provide a concise, intuitive, and practical introduction to DRL, with a particular focus on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is one of the most widely used and effective DRL methods. To facilitate learning, we organize all algorithms under the Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI) framework, offering readers a unified and systematic perspective. Instead of lengthy theoretical proofs, we emphasize intuitive explanations, illustrative examples, and practical engineering techniques. This work serves as an efficient and accessible guide, helping readers rapidly progress from basic concepts to the implementation of advanced DRL algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Curriculum Learning for Driving Scenarios: Towards Robust and Efficient Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08264v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges of training end-to-end autonomous driving agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL agents are typically trained in a fixed set of scenarios and nominal behavior of surrounding road users in simulations, limiting their generalization and real-life deployment. While domain randomization offers a potential solution by randomly sampling driving scenarios, it frequently results in inefficient training and sub-optimal policies due to the high variance among training scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an automatic curriculum learning framework that dynamically generates driving scenarios with adaptive complexity based on the agent's evolving capabilities. Unlike manually designed curricula that introduce expert bias and lack scalability, our framework incorporates a ``teacher'' that automatically generates and mutates driving scenarios based on their learning potential -- an agent-centric metric derived from the agent's current policy -- eliminating the need for expert design. The framework enhances training efficiency by excluding scenarios the agent has mastered or finds too challenging. We evaluate our framework in a reinforcement learning setting where the agent learns a driving policy from camera images. Comparative results against baseline methods, including fixed scenario training and domain randomization, demonstrate that our approach leads to enhanced generalization, achieving higher success rates: +9\% in low traffic density, +21\% in high traffic density, and faster convergence with fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the potential of ACL in improving the robustness and efficiency of RL-based autonomous driving agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |

While deep reinforcement learning has achieved a number of successes in these domains, it is computationally intensive and time consuming, and therefore not suitable for solving large collections of tasks that require significant manual tuning. In this work, we introduce Model Predictive Control with Morphology-aware Proportional Control (MPC^2), a hierarchical model-based learning algorithm for zero-shot and near-real-time control of high-dimensional complex dynamical systems. MPC^2 uses a sampling-based model predictive controller for target posture planning, and enables robust control for high-dimensional tasks by incorporating a morphology-aware proportional controller for actuator coordination. The algorithm enables motion control of a high-dimensional human musculoskeletal model in a variety of motion tasks, such as standing, walking on different terrains, and imitating sports activities. The reward function of MPC^2 can be tuned via black-box optimization, drastically reducing the need for human-intensive reward engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

In addition, the intractable element of the infinite dimensionality of distributions has been overlooked. In this paper, we present a regret analysis of distributional reinforcement learning with general value function approximation in a finite episodic Markov decision process setting. We first introduce a key notion of $\textit{Bellman unbiasedness}$ which is essential for exactly learnable and provably efficient distributional updates in an online manner. Among all types of statistical functionals for representing infinite-dimensional return distributions, our theoretical results demonstrate that only moment functionals can exactly capture the statistical information. Secondly, we propose a provably efficient algorithm, $\texttt{SF-LSVI}$, that achieves a tight regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d_E H^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{K})$ where $H$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes, and $d_E$ is the eluder dimension of a function class.</p></details> |  |

While various fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategies using reinforcement learning (RL) have been widely explored, most previous approaches require prior knowledge of the multirotor model or struggle to adapt to new configurations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid RL-based FTC framework integrated with a transformer-based online adaptation module. Our framework leverages a transformer architecture to infer latent representations in real time, enabling adaptation to previously unseen system models without retraining. We evaluate our method in a PyBullet simulation under loss-of-effectiveness actuator faults, achieving a 95% success rate and a positional root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.129 m, outperforming existing adaptation methods with 86% success and an RMSE of 0.153 m. Further evaluations on quadrotors with varying configurations confirm the robustness of our framework across untrained dynamics. These results demonstrate the potential of our framework to enhance the adaptability and reliability of multirotors, enabling efficient fault management in dynamic and uncertain environments.

| **[Policy-labeled Preference Learning: Is Preference Enough for RLHF?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06273v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To design rewards that align with human goals, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent technique for learning reward functions from human preferences and optimizing policies via reinforcement learning algorithms. However, existing RLHF methods often misinterpret trajectories as being generated by an optimal policy, causing inaccurate likelihood estimation and suboptimal learning. Inspired by Direct Preference Optimization framework which directly learns optimal policy without explicit reward, we propose policy-labeled preference learning (PPL), to resolve likelihood mismatch issues by modeling human preferences with regret, which reflects behavior policy information. We also provide a contrastive KL regularization, derived from regret-based principles, to enhance RLHF in sequential decision making. Experiments in high-dimensional continuous control tasks demonstrate PPL's significant improvements in offline RLHF performance and its effectiveness in online settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning for Underwater Acoustic Tracking via Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08222v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles (AV) offer a cost-effective solution for scientific missions such as underwater tracking. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for controlling AVs in complex marine environments. However, scaling these techniques to a fleet--essential for multi-target tracking or targets with rapid, unpredictable motion--presents significant computational challenges. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is notoriously sample-inefficient, and while high-fidelity simulators like Gazebo's LRAUV provide 100x faster-than-real-time single-robot simulations, they offer no significant speedup for multi-vehicle scenarios, making MARL training impractical. To address these limitations, we propose an iterative distillation method that transfers high-fidelity simulations into a simplified, GPU-accelerated environment while preserving high-level dynamics. This approach achieves up to a 30,000x speedup over Gazebo through parallelization, enabling efficient training via end-to-end GPU acceleration. Additionally, we introduce a novel Transformer-based architecture (TransfMAPPO) that learns multi-agent policies invariant to the number of agents and targets, significantly improving sample efficiency. Following large-scale curriculum learning conducted entirely on GPU, we perform extensive evaluations in Gazebo, demonstrating that our method maintains tracking errors below 5 meters over extended durations, even in the presence of multiple fast-moving targets. This work bridges the gap between large-scale MARL training and high-fidelity deployment, providing a scalable framework for autonomous fleet control in real-world sea missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSADF: Thinking Fast and Slow for Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08189v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are effective in well-defined environments, they often struggle to generalize their learned policies to dynamic settings due to their reliance on trial-and-error interactions. Recent work has explored applying Large Language Models (LLMs) or Vision Language Models (VLMs) to boost the generalization of RL agents through policy optimization guidance or prior knowledge. However, these approaches often lack seamless coordination between the RL agent and the foundation model, leading to unreasonable decision-making in unfamiliar environments and efficiency bottlenecks. Making full use of the inferential capabilities of foundation models and the rapid response capabilities of RL agents and enhancing the interaction between the two to form a dual system is still a lingering scientific question. To address this problem, we draw inspiration from Kahneman's theory of fast thinking (System 1) and slow thinking (System 2), demonstrating that balancing intuition and deep reasoning can achieve nimble decision-making in a complex world. In this study, we propose a Dual-System Adaptive Decision Framework (DSADF), integrating two complementary modules: System 1, comprising an RL agent and a memory space for fast and intuitive decision making, and System 2, driven by a VLM for deep and analytical reasoning. DSADF facilitates efficient and adaptive decision-making by combining the strengths of both systems. The empirical study in the video game environment: Crafter and Housekeep demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method, showing significant improvements in decision abilities for both unseen and known tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the majority of existing approaches emphasize only short-term safety, neglecting long-horizon considerations. Consequently, they may violate safety constraints and fail to ensure sustained protection during online deployment. Moreover, the learned policies often struggle to handle states and actions that are not present or out-of-distribution(OOD) from the offline dataset, and exhibit limited sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework Feasibility-Aware offline Safe Reinforcement Learning with CVAE-based Pessimism (FASP). First, we employ Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) reachability analysis to generate reliable safety labels, which serve as supervisory signals for training both a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and a safety classifier. This approach not only ensures high sampling efficiency but also provides rigorous long-horizon safety guarantees. Furthermore, we utilize pessimistic estimation methods to estimate the Q-value of reward and cost, which mitigates the extrapolation errors induces by OOD actions, and penalize unsafe actions to enabled the agent to proactively avoid high-risk behaviors. Moreover, we theoretically prove the validity of this pessimistic estimation. Extensive experiments on DSRL benchmarks demonstrate that FASP algorithm achieves competitive performance across multiple experimental tasks, particularly outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of safety.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides a structured survey of recent advances in GUI agents, focusing on architectures enhanced by Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first formalize GUI agent tasks as Markov Decision Processes and discuss typical execution environments and evaluation metrics. We then review the modular architecture of (M)LLM-based GUI agents, covering Perception, Planning, and Acting modules, and trace their evolution through representative works. Furthermore, we categorize GUI agent training methodologies into Prompt-based, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)-based, and RL-based approaches, highlighting the progression from simple prompt engineering to dynamic policy learning via RL. Our summary illustrates how recent innovations in multimodal perception, decision reasoning, and adaptive action generation have significantly improved the generalization and robustness of GUI agents in complex real-world environments. We conclude by identifying key challenges and future directions for building more capable and reliable GUI agents.</p></details> |  |

The proposed high-order regularization (HR) provides new insight into regularization, which is widely used to train a neural network that can be utilized to approximate the action-value function in general reinforcement learning problems. The proposed HR method ensures the provable convergence of the approximation algorithm, which makes the much-needed connection between regularization and explainable learning using neural networks. The proposed HR method theoretically demonstrates that regularization can be regarded as an approximation in terms of inverse mapping with explicitly calculable approximation error, and the $L_2$ regularization is a lower-order case of the proposed method. We provide lower and upper bounds for the error of the proposed HR solution, which helps build a reliable model. We also find that regularization with the proposed HR can be regarded as a contraction. We prove that the generalizability of neural networks can be maximized with a proper regularization matrix, and the proposed HR is applicable for neural networks with any mapping matrix. With the theoretical explanation of the extreme learning machine for neural network training and the proposed high-order regularization, one can better interpret the output of the neural network, thus leading to explainable learning. We present a case study based on regularized extreme learning neural networks to demonstrate the application of the proposed HR and give the corresponding incremental HR solution. We verify the performance of the proposed HR method by solving a classic control problem in reinforcement learning. The result demonstrates the superior performance of the method with significant enhancement in the generalizability of the neural network.</p></details> |  |

By transforming nonlinear dynamical systems into a higher-dimensional linear regime, the Koopman operator facilitates the linear treatment of nonlinear behaviors, paving the way for more efficient control strategies. Our methodology harnesses the predictive prowess of Koopman-based models alongside the optimization capabilities of DRL, particularly using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to enhance the controller's performance. The resulting end-to-end learning framework refines the predictive control policies to cater to specific operational tasks, optimizing both performance and economic efficiency. We validate our approach through rigorous NMPC and eNMPC case studies, demonstrating that the Koopman-RL controller outperforms traditional controllers by achieving higher stability, superior constraint satisfaction, and significant cost savings. The findings indicate that our model can be a robust tool for complex control tasks, offering valuable insights into future applications of RL in MPC.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 2 author photos.

| **[What Matters for Batch Online Reinforcement Learning in Robotics?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08078v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to learn from large batches of autonomously collected data for policy improvement -- a paradigm we refer to as batch online reinforcement learning -- holds the promise of enabling truly scalable robot learning by significantly reducing the need for human effort of data collection while getting benefits from self-improvement. Yet, despite the promise of this paradigm, it remains challenging to achieve due to algorithms not being able to learn effectively from the autonomous data. For example, prior works have applied imitation learning and filtered imitation learning methods to the batch online RL problem, but these algorithms often fail to efficiently improve from the autonomously collected data or converge quickly to a suboptimal point. This raises the question of what matters for effective batch online RL in robotics. Motivated by this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of three axes -- (i) algorithm class, (ii) policy extraction methods, and (iii) policy expressivity -- and analyze how these axes affect performance and scaling with the amount of autonomous data. Through our analysis, we make several observations. First, we observe that the use of Q-functions to guide batch online RL significantly improves performance over imitation-based methods. Building on this, we show that an implicit method of policy extraction -- via choosing the best action in the distribution of the policy -- is necessary over traditional policy extraction methods from offline RL. Next, we show that an expressive policy class is preferred over less expressive policy classes. Based on this analysis, we propose a general recipe for effective batch online RL. We then show a simple addition to the recipe of using temporally-correlated noise to obtain more diversity results in further performance gains. Our recipe obtains significantly better performance and scaling compared to prior methods.</p></details> |  |

Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has an added complexity due to the temporal nature of sequential decision-making. Further, non-AI experts do not necessarily have the ability to alter an agent or its policy. We introduce a technique for using World Models to generate explanations for Model-Based Deep RL agents. World Models predict how the world will change when actions are performed, allowing for the generation of counterfactual trajectories. However, identifying what a user wanted the agent to do is not enough to understand why the agent did something else. We augment Model-Based RL agents with a Reverse World Model, which predicts what the state of the world should have been for the agent to prefer a given counterfactual action. We show that explanations that show users what the world should have been like significantly increase their understanding of the agent policy. We hypothesize that our explanations can help users learn how to control the agents execution through by manipulating the environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper content spans 7 pages, followed by a page of references.

We propose an Online Learning framework using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with an enhanced state representation (velocity and blockage history), a GRU architecture, and prioritized experience replay for real-time beam optimization. Validated via Nvidia Sionna under time-correlated blockage, our approach significantly enhances resilience in SNR, throughput, and accuracy compared to a conventional heuristic. Furthermore, the enhanced DRL agent outperforms a reactive Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) baseline by leveraging temporal dependencies, achieving lower performance variability. This demonstrates the benefits of memory and prioritized learning for robust 6G beam management, while confirming MAB as a strong baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in specialized domains-particularly those requiring resource-efficient and domain-specific adaptations-has remained limited. In this work, a lightweight multimodal language model termed MilChat is introduced, specifically adapted to analyze remote sensing imagery in secluded areas, including challenging missile launch sites. A new dataset, MilData, was compiled by verifying hundreds of aerial images through expert review, and subtle military installations were highlighted via detailed captions. Supervised fine-tuning on a 2B-parameter open-source MLLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning annotations was performed, enabling more accurate and interpretable explanations. Additionally, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was leveraged to enhance the model's ability to detect critical domain-specific cues-such as defensive layouts and key military structures-while minimizing false positives on civilian scenes. Through empirical evaluations, it has been shown that MilChat significantly outperforms both larger, general-purpose multimodal models and existing remote sensing-adapted approaches on open-ended captioning and classification metrics. Over 80% recall and 98% precision were achieved on the newly proposed MilData benchmark, underscoring the potency of targeted fine-tuning and reinforcement learning in specialized real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to JSTARS on April 2, 2025.

| **[Making Small Language Models Efficient Reasoners: Intervention, Supervision, Reinforcement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07961v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research enhances language model reasoning by scaling test-time compute via longer chain-of-thought traces. This often improves accuracy but also introduces redundancy and high computational cost, especially for small language models distilled with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we propose new algorithms to improve token-efficient reasoning with small-scale models by effectively trading off accuracy and computation. We first show that the post-SFT model fails to determine the optimal stopping point of the reasoning process, resulting in verbose and repetitive outputs. Verbosity also significantly varies across wrong vs correct responses. To address these issues, we propose two solutions: (1) Temperature scaling (TS) to control the stopping point for the thinking phase and thereby trace length, and (2) TLDR: a length-regularized reinforcement learning method based on GRPO that facilitates multi-level trace length control (e.g. short, medium, long reasoning). Experiments on four reasoning benchmarks, MATH500, AMC, AIME24 and OlympiadBench, demonstrate that TS is highly effective compared to s1's budget forcing approach and TLDR significantly improves token efficiency by about 50% with minimal to no accuracy loss over the SFT baseline. Moreover, TLDR also facilitates flexible control over the response length, offering a practical and effective solution for token-efficient reasoning in small models. Ultimately, our work reveals the importance of stopping time control, highlights shortcomings of pure SFT, and provides effective algorithmic recipes.</p></details> |  |

Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for visual generation face critical limitations: incompatibility with modern Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)-based sampling paradigms, instability in large-scale training, and lack of validation for video generation. This paper introduces DanceGRPO, the first unified framework to adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to visual generation paradigms, unleashing one unified RL algorithm across two generative paradigms (diffusion models and rectified flows), three tasks (text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video), four foundation models (Stable Diffusion, HunyuanVideo, FLUX, SkyReel-I2V), and five reward models (image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary reward). To our knowledge, DanceGRPO is the first RL-based unified framework capable of seamless adaptation across diverse generative paradigms, tasks, foundational models, and reward models. DanceGRPO demonstrates consistent and substantial improvements, which outperform baselines by up to 181% on benchmarks such as HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Notably, DanceGRPO not only can stabilize policy optimization for complex video generation, but also enables generative policy to better capture denoising trajectories for Best-of-N inference scaling and learn from sparse binary feedback. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis.

This lack of transparency limits deployment, especially in safety-critical settings where human trust and accountability are essential. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for explaining reinforcement learning through the influence of state features, which represent what the agent observes in its environment. We identify three core elements of the agent-environment interaction that benefit from explanation: behaviour (what the agent does), performance (what the agent achieves), and value estimation (what the agent expects to achieve). We treat state features as players cooperating to produce each element and apply Shapley values, a principled method from cooperative game theory, to identify the influence of each feature. This approach yields a family of mathematically grounded explanations with clear semantics and theoretical guarantees. We use illustrative examples to show how these explanations align with human intuition and reveal novel insights. Our framework unifies and extends prior work, making explicit the assumptions behind existing approaches, and offers a principled foundation for more interpretable and trustworthy reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily rely on static datasets or single-attempt evaluations, MLE-Dojo provides an interactive environment enabling agents to iteratively experiment, debug, and refine solutions through structured feedback loops. Built upon 200+ real-world Kaggle challenges, MLE-Dojo covers diverse, open-ended MLE tasks carefully curated to reflect realistic engineering scenarios such as data processing, architecture search, hyperparameter tuning, and code debugging. Its fully executable environment supports comprehensive agent training via both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, facilitating iterative experimentation, realistic data sampling, and real-time outcome verification. Extensive evaluations of eight frontier LLMs reveal that while current models achieve meaningful iterative improvements, they still exhibit significant limitations in autonomously generating long-horizon solutions and efficiently resolving complex errors. Furthermore, MLE-Dojo's flexible and extensible architecture seamlessly integrates diverse data sources, tools, and evaluation protocols, uniquely enabling model-based agent tuning and promoting interoperability, scalability, and reproducibility. We open-source our framework and benchmarks to foster community-driven innovation towards next-generation MLE agents.</p></details> |  |

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.

| **[S-GRPO: Early Exit via Reinforcement Learning in Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07686v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Test-Time Scaling emerges as an active research focus in the large language model community, advanced post-training methods increasingly emphasize extending chain-of-thought (CoT) generation length, thereby enhancing reasoning capabilities to approach Deepseek R1-like reasoning models. However, recent studies reveal that reasoning models (even Qwen3) consistently exhibit excessive thought redundancy in CoT generation. This overthinking problem stems from conventional outcome-reward reinforcement learning's systematic neglect in regulating intermediate reasoning steps. This paper proposes Serial-Group Decaying-Reward Policy Optimization (namely S-GRPO), a novel reinforcement learning method that empowers models with the capability to determine the sufficiency of reasoning steps, subsequently triggering early exit of CoT generation. Specifically, unlike GRPO, which samples multiple possible completions (parallel group) in parallel, we select multiple temporal positions in the generation of one CoT to allow the model to exit thinking and instead generate answers (serial group), respectively. For the correct answers in a serial group, we assign rewards that decay according to positions, with lower rewards towards the later ones, thereby reinforcing the model's behavior to generate higher-quality answers at earlier phases with earlier exits of thinking. Empirical evaluations demonstrate compatibility with state-of-the-art reasoning models, including Qwen3 and Deepseek-distill models, achieving 35.4% ~ 61.1\% sequence length reduction with 0.72% ~ 6.08% accuracy improvements across GSM8K, AIME 2024, AMC 2023, MATH-500, and GPQA Diamond benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

In light of this trend, the field of automated trading has developed a keen interest in leveraging AI techniques to forecast the future prices of financial assets. This interest stems from the need to address trading challenges posed by the inherent volatility and dynamic nature of asset prices. However, crafting a flawless strategy becomes a formidable task when dealing with assets characterized by intricate and ever-changing price dynamics. To surmount these formidable challenges, this research employs an innovative rule-based strategy approach to train Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This application is carried out specifically in the context of trading Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP). Our proposed approach hinges on the integration of Deep Q-Network, Double Deep Q-Network, Dueling Deep Q-learning networks, alongside the Advantage Actor-Critic algorithms. Each of them aims to yield an optimal policy for our application. To evaluate the effectiveness of our Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach, we rely on portfolio wealth and the trade signal as performance metrics. The experimental outcomes highlight that Duelling and Double Deep Q-Network outperformed when using XRP with the increasing of the portfolio wealth.

MiMo-7B-Base is pre-trained on 25 trillion tokens, with additional Multi-Token Prediction objective for enhanced performance and accelerated inference speed. During post-training, we curate a dataset of 130K verifiable mathematics and programming problems for reinforcement learning, integrating a test-difficulty-driven code-reward scheme to alleviate sparse-reward issues and employing strategic data resampling to stabilize training. Extensive evaluations show that MiMo-7B-Base possesses exceptional reasoning potential, outperforming even much larger 32B models.

In this work, we present a multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework for energy-efficient control of the Quanser Aero 2 testbed in its one-degree-of-freedom configuration. We design a composite reward function that simultaneously penalizes tracking error and electrical power consumption. Preliminary experiments explore the influence of varying the Energy penalty weight, alpha, on the trade-off between pitch tracking and energy savings. Our results reveal a marked performance shift for alpha values between 0.0 and 0.25, with non-Pareto optimal solutions emerging at lower alpha values, on both the simulation and the real system. We hypothesize that these effects may be attributed to artifacts introduced by the adaptive behavior of the Adam optimizer, which could bias the learning process and favor bang-bang control strategies. Future work will focus on automating alpha selection through Gaussian Process-based Pareto front modeling and transitioning the approach from simulation to real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at DEXA 2025 (AI4IP)</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Internal-External Knowledge Synergistic Reasoning for Efficient Adaptive Search Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07596v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a common strategy to reduce hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL) can enable LLMs to act as search agents by activating retrieval capabilities, existing ones often underutilize their internal knowledge. This can lead to redundant retrievals, potential harmful knowledge conflicts, and increased inference latency. To address these limitations, an efficient and adaptive search agent capable of discerning optimal retrieval timing and synergistically integrating parametric (internal) and retrieved (external) knowledge is in urgent need. This paper introduces the Reinforced Internal-External Knowledge Synergistic Reasoning Agent (IKEA), which could indentify its own knowledge boundary and prioritize the utilization of internal knowledge, resorting to external search only when internal knowledge is deemed insufficient. This is achieved using a novel knowledge-boundary aware reward function and a knowledge-boundary aware training dataset. These are designed for internal-external knowledge synergy oriented RL, incentivizing the model to deliver accurate answers, minimize unnecessary retrievals, and encourage appropriate external searches when its own knowledge is lacking. Evaluations across multiple knowledge reasoning tasks demonstrate that IKEA significantly outperforms baseline methods, reduces retrieval frequency significantly, and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Dimensional Constraint Framework for Evaluating and Improving Instruction Following in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07591v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction following evaluates large language models (LLMs) on their ability to generate outputs that adhere to user-defined constraints. However, existing benchmarks often rely on templated constraint prompts, which lack the diversity of real-world usage and limit fine-grained performance assessment. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional constraint framework encompassing three constraint patterns, four constraint categories, and four difficulty levels. Building on this framework, we develop an automated instruction generation pipeline that performs constraint expansion, conflict detection, and instruction rewriting, yielding 1,200 code-verifiable instruction-following test samples. We evaluate 19 LLMs across seven model families and uncover substantial variation in performance across constraint forms. For instance, average performance drops from 77.67% at Level I to 32.96% at Level IV. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to generate data for reinforcement learning, achieving substantial gains in instruction following without degrading general performance. In-depth analysis indicates that these gains stem primarily from modifications in the model's attention modules parameters, which enhance constraint recognition and adherence. Code and data are available in https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/MulDimIF.</p></details> |  |

However, there are few comprehensive reviews to summarize the progress of Bayesian inference on reinforcement learning (RL) for decision making to give researchers a systematic understanding. This paper focuses on combining Bayesian inference with RL that nowadays is an important approach in agent decision making. To be exact, this paper discusses the following five topics: 1) Bayesian methods that have potential for agent decision making. First basic Bayesian methods and models (Bayesian rule, Bayesian learning, and Bayesian conjugate models) are discussed followed by variational inference, Bayesian optimization, Bayesian deep learning, Bayesian active learning, Bayesian generative models, Bayesian meta-learning, and lifelong Bayesian learning. 2) Classical combinations of Bayesian methods with model-based RL (with approximation methods), model-free RL, and inverse RL. 3) Latest combinations of potential Bayesian methods with RL. 4) Analytical comparisons of methods that combine Bayesian methods with RL with respect to data-efficiency, generalization, interpretability, and safety. 5) In-depth discussions in six complex problem variants of RL, including unknown reward, partial-observability, multi-agent, multi-task, non-linear non-Gaussian, and hierarchical RL problems and the summary of how Bayesian methods work in the data collection, data processing and policy learning stages of RL to pave the way for better agent decision-making strategies.</p></details> |  |

Traditional sliding mode controllers with fixed parameters often struggle to maintain optimal performance under these fluctuating conditions. Therefore, an adaptive controller is essential to address these challenges by continuously tuning its gains in real-time. In this paper, we have tuned the slopes of the Fixed-time Sliding surface adaptively using reinforcement learning for coupled rendezvous and docking maneuver of chaser satellite with the target satellite in an unknown space environment. The neural network model is used to determine the optimal gains of reaching law of the fixed-time sliding surface. We have assumed that we don't have an accurate model of the system so we have added noise in the tangent space instead of directly on the manifold to preserve the geometric structure of the system while ensuring mathematically consistent uncertainty propagation. The reinforcement learning is used as an approximator to represent the value function of the agent to estimate the dynamical model of the system using the Actor-Critic method. The proposed control algorithm integrates a neural network and a sliding mode controller in a cascade loop architecture, where the tracking error dynamically tunes the sliding surface gains. Global fixed-time stability of the closed-loop feedback system is proved within the Lyapunov framework. This comprehensive approach of fixed-time sliding mode controller using a Reinforcement Learning based ensures the completion of the mission efficiently while addressing the critical challenges posed by the uncertain environment. The simulation results presented support the claims made.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Visual Tokens of Autoregression, by Diffusion, and for Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07538v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We completely discard the conventional spatial prior in image representation and introduce a novel discrete visual tokenizer: Self-consistency Tokenizer (Selftok). At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior -- mirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the reverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok fundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key ways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion and AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok tokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture -- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training objectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman equation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports reinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable to that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA tokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality reconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for both visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any text-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual tokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all the existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok effectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot support effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL in LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM.

Recently, for language modeling, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is proposed to compute the advantage for each output by subtracting the mean reward, as the baseline, for all outputs in the group. However, it can lead to inaccurate advantage estimates in environments with highly noisy rewards, potentially introducing bias. In this work, we propose a model, called Kalman Filter Enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization (KRPO), by using lightweight Kalman filtering to dynamically estimate the latent reward mean and variance. This filtering technique replaces the naive batch mean baseline, enabling more adaptive advantage normalization. Our method does not require additional learned parameters over GRPO. This approach offers a simple yet effective way to incorporate multiple outputs of GRPO into advantage estimation, improving policy optimization in settings where highly dynamic reward signals are difficult to model for language models. Through experiments and analyses, we show that using a more adaptive advantage estimation model, KRPO can improve the stability and performance of GRPO.

However, the variable quality of training data often constrains the performance of these models. On the other hand, offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at learning robust policy models from mixed-quality data. In this paper, we introduce Reinforced robot GPT (ReinboT), a novel end-to-end VLA model that integrates the RL principle of maximizing cumulative reward. ReinboT achieves a deeper understanding of the data quality distribution by predicting dense returns that capture the nuances of manipulation tasks. The dense return prediction capability enables the robot to generate more robust decision-making actions, oriented towards maximizing future benefits. Extensive experiments show that ReinboT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN mixed-quality dataset and exhibits superior few-shot learning and out-of-distribution generalization capabilities in real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, teaching models to discern when to invoke search and when to rely on their internal knowledge remains a significant challenge. Existing reinforcement learning approaches often lead to redundant search behaviors, resulting in inefficiencies and over-cost. In this paper, we propose SEM, a novel post-training reinforcement learning framework that explicitly trains LLMs to optimize search usage. By constructing a balanced dataset combining MuSiQue and MMLU, we create scenarios where the model must learn to distinguish between questions it can answer directly and those requiring external retrieval. We design a structured reasoning template and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) to post-train the model's search behaviors. Our reward function encourages accurate answering without unnecessary search while promoting effective retrieval when needed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces redundant search operations while maintaining or improving answer accuracy across multiple challenging benchmarks. This framework advances the model's reasoning efficiency and extends its capability to judiciously leverage external knowledge.</p></details> |  |

An individual agent's local observation often consists of multiple components from other agents or dynamic entities in the environment. These discrete observation components with varying delay characteristics pose significant challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In this paper, we first formulate the decentralized stochastic individual delay partially observable Markov decision process (DSID-POMDP) by extending the standard Dec-POMDP. We then propose the Rainbow Delay Compensation (RDC), a MARL training framework for addressing stochastic individual delays, along with recommended implementations for its constituent modules. We implement the DSID-POMDP's observation generation pattern using standard MARL benchmarks, including MPE and SMAC. Experiments demonstrate that baseline MARL methods suffer severe performance degradation under fixed and unfixed delays. The RDC-enhanced approach mitigates this issue, remarkably achieving ideal delay-free performance in certain delay scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Our work provides a novel perspective on multi-agent delayed observation problems and offers an effective solution framework.

Most traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches rely on extensive simulation-based pre-training, which faces crucial challenges in transfer effectively to real-world environments. This paper introduces a robust on-board RL framework for autonomous racing, designed to eliminate the dependency on simulation-based pre-training enabling direct real-world adaptation. The proposed system introduces a refined Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, leveraging a residual RL structure to enhance classical controllers in real-time by integrating multi-step Temporal-Difference (TD) learning, an asynchronous training pipeline, and Heuristic Delayed Reward Adjustment (HDRA) to improve sample efficiency and training stability. The framework is validated through extensive experiments on the F1TENTH racing platform, where the residual RL controller consistently outperforms the baseline controllers and achieves up to an 11.5 % reduction in lap times compared to the State-of-the-Art (SotA) with only 20 min of training. Additionally, an End-to-End (E2E) RL controller trained without a baseline controller surpasses the previous best results with sustained on-track learning. These findings position the framework as a robust solution for high-performance autonomous racing and a promising direction for other real-time, dynamic autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Episodic Convex Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07303v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study online learning in episodic finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with convex objective functions, known as the concave utility reinforcement learning (CURL) problem. This setting generalizes RL from linear to convex losses on the state-action distribution induced by the agent's policy. The non-linearity of CURL invalidates classical Bellman equations and requires new algorithmic approaches. We introduce the first algorithm achieving near-optimal regret bounds for online CURL without any prior knowledge on the transition function. To achieve this, we use an online mirror descent algorithm with varying constraint sets and a carefully designed exploration bonus. We then address for the first time a bandit version of CURL, where the only feedback is the value of the objective function on the state-action distribution induced by the agent's policy. We achieve a sub-linear regret bound for this more challenging problem by adapting techniques from bandit convex optimization to the MDP setting.</p></details> |  |

While recent research on humanoid control has leveraged reinforcement learning to track human motions for skill acquisition, applying this paradigm to balance-intensive tasks remains challenging. In this work, we identify three key obstacles: instability from reference motion errors, learning difficulties due to morphological mismatch, and the sim-to-real gap caused by sensor noise and unmodeled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose HuB (Humanoid Balance), a unified framework that integrates reference motion refinement, balance-aware policy learning, and sim-to-real robustness training, with each component targeting a specific challenge. We validate our approach on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot across challenging quasi-static balance tasks, including extreme single-legged poses such as Swallow Balance and Bruce Lee's Kick. Our policy remains stable even under strong physical disturbances-such as a forceful soccer strike-while baseline methods consistently fail to complete these tasks.

Unlike traditional centralized training efforts, INTELLECT-2 trains a reasoning model using fully asynchronous RL across a dynamic, heterogeneous swarm of permissionless compute contributors. To enable a training run with this unique infrastructure, we built various components from scratch: we introduce PRIME-RL, our training framework purpose-built for distributed asynchronous reinforcement learning, based on top of novel components such as TOPLOC, which verifies rollouts from untrusted inference workers, and SHARDCAST, which efficiently broadcasts policy weights from training nodes to inference workers. Beyond infrastructure components, we propose modifications to the standard GRPO training recipe and data filtering techniques that were crucial to achieve training stability and ensure that our model successfully learned its training objective, thus improving upon QwQ-32B, the state of the art reasoning model in the 32B parameter range. We open-source INTELLECT-2 along with all of our code and data, hoping to encourage and enable more open research in the field of decentralized training.</p></details> | 26 pages, 12 figures |

As highly accurate replicas of vehicles, VTs can support intelligent vehicular applications for occupants in 6G-enabled IoV. Thanks to the full coverage capability of 6G, resource-constrained vehicles can offload VTs to edge servers, such as roadside units, unmanned aerial vehicles, and satellites, utilizing their computing and storage resources for VT construction and updates. However, communication between vehicles and edge servers with limited coverage is prone to interruptions due to the dynamic mobility of vehicles. Consequently, VTs must be migrated among edge servers to maintain uninterrupted and high-quality services for users. In this paper, we introduce a VT migration framework in 6G-enabled IoV. Specifically, we first propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Transformer model to accurately predict long-term workloads of edge servers for migration decision-making. Then, we propose a Dynamic Mask Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (DM-MAPPO) algorithm to identify optimal migration routes in the highly complex environment of 6G-enabled IoV. Finally, we develop a practical platform to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme using real datasets. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DM-MAPPO algorithm significantly reduces migration latency by 20.82% and packet loss by 75.07% compared with traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |

We present a principled cache-efficient framework for posterior sampling with LLM-derived priors that dramatically reduces these costs while maintaining high performance. At the core of our approach is an adaptive caching mechanism, where cache parameters are meta-optimized using surrogate gradients derived from policy performance. This design enables efficient inference across both discrete text environments (e.g., TextWorld, ALFWorld) and continuous control domains (e.g., MuJoCo), achieving a 3.8--4.7$\times$ reduction in LLM queries and 4.0--12.0$\times$ lower median latencies (85--93\,ms on a consumer GPU) while retaining 96--98\% of uncached performance. Our theoretical analysis provides KL divergence bounds on approximation quality, validated empirically. The framework extends to offline RL, where our CQL-Prior variant improves performance by 14--29\% and reduces training time by 38--40\%. Extensive evaluations across a diverse suite of eight tasks demonstrate the generalizability and practical viability of LLM-guided RL in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Robustness of Reward Models for Language Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07271v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is widely practiced in reward modeling for reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Despite its effectiveness, reward models (RMs) trained with BT model loss are prone to over-optimization, losing generalizability to unseen input distributions. In this paper, we study the cause of over-optimization in RM training and its downstream effects on the RLHF procedure, accentuating the importance of distributional robustness of RMs in unseen data. First, we show that the excessive dispersion of hidden state norms is the main source of over-optimization. Then, we propose batch-wise sum-to-zero regularization (BSR) to enforce zero-centered reward sum per batch, constraining the rewards with extreme magnitudes. We assess the impact of BSR in improving robustness in RMs through four scenarios of over-optimization, where BSR consistently manifests better robustness. Subsequently, we compare the plain BT model and BSR on RLHF training and empirically show that robust RMs better align the policy to the gold preference model. Finally, we apply BSR to high-quality data and models, which surpasses state-of-the-art RMs in the 8B scale by adding more than 5% in complex preference prediction tasks. By conducting RLOO training with 8B RMs, AlpacaEval 2.0 reduces generation length by 40% while adding a 7% increase in win rate, further highlighting that robustness in RMs induces robustness in RLHF training.

| **[DARLR: Dual-Agent Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems with Dynamic Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07257v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based offline reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for recommender systems, enabling effective policy learning by interacting with frozen world models. However, the reward functions in these world models, trained on sparse offline logs, often suffer from inaccuracies. Specifically, existing methods face two major limitations in addressing this challenge: (1) deterministic use of reward functions as static look-up tables, which propagates inaccuracies during policy learning, and (2) static uncertainty designs that fail to effectively capture decision risks and mitigate the impact of these inaccuracies. In this work, a dual-agent framework, DARLR, is proposed to dynamically update world models to enhance recommendation policies. To achieve this, a \textbf{\textit{selector}} is introduced to identify reference users by balancing similarity and diversity so that the \textbf{\textit{recommender}} can aggregate information from these users and iteratively refine reward estimations for dynamic reward shaping. Further, the statistical features of the selected users guide the dynamic adaptation of an uncertainty penalty to better align with evolving recommendation requirements. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DARLR, validating its effectiveness.

Despite recent advancements in enhancing human-computer interaction within database applications, significant challenges persist, particularly regarding the inference performance in complex scenarios involving multi-table joins and nested queries. Current methodologies primarily utilize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train the NL2SQL model, which may limit adaptability and interpretability in new environments (e.g., finance and healthcare). In order to enhance the reasoning performance of the NL2SQL model in the above complex situations, we introduce SQL-R1, a novel NL2SQL reasoning model trained by the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. We design a specialized RL-based reward function tailored for NL2SQL tasks and discussed the impact of cold start on the effectiveness of intensive training. In addition, we achieve competitive accuracy using only a tiny amount of synthetic NL2SQL data for augmented training and further explore data engineering for RL. In existing experiments, SQL-R1 achieves execution accuracy of 88.6% and 66.6% on the benchmark Spider and BIRD, respectively, only using the 7B base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROLeR: Effective Reward Shaping in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13163v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective tool for real-world recommender systems with its capacity to model the dynamic interest of users and its interactive nature. Most existing offline RL recommender systems focus on model-based RL through learning a world model from offline data and building the recommendation policy by interacting with this model. Although these methods have made progress in the recommendation performance, the effectiveness of model-based offline RL methods is often constrained by the accuracy of the estimation of the reward model and the model uncertainties, primarily due to the extreme discrepancy between offline logged data and real-world data in user interactions with online platforms. To fill this gap, a more accurate reward model and uncertainty estimation are needed for the model-based RL methods. In this paper, a novel model-based Reward Shaping in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems, ROLeR, is proposed for reward and uncertainty estimation in recommendation systems. Specifically, a non-parametric reward shaping method is designed to refine the reward model. In addition, a flexible and more representative uncertainty penalty is designed to fit the needs of recommendation systems. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets showcase that ROLeR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing baselines.

A crucial but often under-explored component of these systems is the reranker, which refines retrieved documents to enhance generation quality and explainability. The challenge of selecting the optimal number of documents (k) remains unsolved: too few may omit critical information, while too many introduce noise and inefficiencies. Although recent studies have explored LLM-based rerankers, they primarily leverage internal model knowledge and overlook the rich supervisory signals that LLMs can provide, such as using response quality as feedback for optimizing reranking decisions. In this paper, we propose DynamicRAG, a novel RAG framework where the reranker dynamically adjusts both the order and number of retrieved documents based on the query. We model the reranker as an agent optimized through reinforcement learning (RL), using rewards derived from LLM output quality. Across seven knowledge-intensive datasets, DynamicRAG demonstrates superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Unlike most static benchmarks, gg-bench is a data generating process where new evaluation instances can be generated at will. In particular, gg-bench is synthetically generated by (1) using a large language model (LLM) to generate natural language descriptions of novel games, (2) using the LLM to implement each game in code as a Gym environment, and (3) training reinforcement learning (RL) agents via self-play on the generated games. We evaluate language models by their winrate against these RL agents by prompting models with the game description, current board state, and a list of valid moves, after which models output the moves they wish to take. gg-bench is challenging: state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieve winrates of 7-9% on gg-bench using in-context learning, while reasoning models such as o1, o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 achieve average winrates of 31-36%.

This paper presents a novel framework that integrates dynamic spectral clustering with hypergraph neural networks to enable adaptive group formation and efficient information processing in multi-agent systems. The proposed framework dynamically constructs and updates hypergraph structures through spectral clustering on agents' state histories, enabling higher-order relationships to emerge naturally from agent interactions. The hypergraph structure is enhanced with attention mechanisms for selective information processing, providing an expressive and efficient way to model complex agent relationships. This architecture can be implemented in both value-based and policy-based paradigms through a unified objective combining task performance with structural regularization. Extensive experiments on challenging cooperative tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both sample efficiency and final performance.</p></details> |  |

To enhance LLMs' tool-calling abilities, previous approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with trajectories distilled from stronger models, often resulting in imitative reasoning that limits generalization. In this work, we explore rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance tool-calling in LLMs, resulting in Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1, a series of tool-calling reasoning models. Rather than enforcing supervision over intermediate distilled reasoning traces, Tool-N1 is trained with a binary RL reward that assesses only the format validity and functional correctness of tool invocations. This lightweight supervision allows the model to develop reasoning strategies independently, without relying on annotated trajectories. Experiments on several major benchmarks show that Tool-N1-7B/14B clearly outperform GPT-4o. We conduct a systematic study on the design of rule-based reinforcement learning strategies for training tool-calling models. Using 5,518 distilled reasoning trajectories, we compare SFT, RL, and the SFT-then-RL pipeline, finding that the widely adopted SFT-then-RL paradigm does not necessarily outperform pure RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 tables, 12 figures. - update new results - add more details</p></details> |

Many such NLP systems, including ours, directly incorporate LLMs. However, this approach either results in expensive costs or yields suboptimal performance after fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce a three-stage cost-efficient end-to-end LLM deployment pipeline, comprising prototyping, knowledge transfer, and model compression, to effectively tackle the cost-performance dilemma in LLM-based frameworks. Its high cost-efficiency is manifested not only in simplifying system complexity and producing super-tiny online models with enhanced performance and reduced costs in the results, but also in addressing development cycle constraints, the lack of extensive high-quality data, and limited computational resources during the project development process. In the first stage, we construct an optimal performance prototype system by transforming complex tasks into a function call-based LLM-driven pipeline, which serves as a teacher model to generate high-quality data. In the second stage, we combine techniques like rejection sampling fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge to 0.5B student models, delivering effective performance at minimal cost. In the final stage, we further compress models to 0.4B via quantization and pruning, achieving ultra-low latency and cost. Extensive experimental results and the framework's modular design suggest cross-domain capabilities and potential applicability in other NLP areas.</p></details> |  |

It holds particular promise for soft robots, which are amenable to novel manufacturing techniques that can realize learned morphologies and actuators. Inspired by nature and recent novel robot designs, we propose to go a step further and explore the novel reconfigurable robots, defined as robots that can change their morphology within their lifetime. We formalize control of reconfigurable soft robots as a high-dimensional reinforcement learning (RL) problem. We unify morphology change, locomotion, and environment interaction in the same action space, and introduce an appropriate, coarse-to-fine curriculum that enables us to discover policies that accomplish fine-grained control of the resulting robots. We also introduce DittoGym, a comprehensive RL benchmark for reconfigurable soft robots that require fine-grained morphology changes to accomplish the tasks. Finally, we evaluate our proposed coarse-to-fine algorithm on DittoGym and demonstrate robots that learn to change their morphology several times within a sequence, uniquely enabled by our RL algorithm.

The large amount of computing resources as well as the massive amount of spatial-temporal data in Digital Twin (DT) domain can be utilized to enhance the communication and control performance of Internet of Vehicle (IoV) systems. In this article, we first propose the architecture of VDTN, emphasizing key modules that center on functions related to the joint optimization of control and communication. We then delve into the intricacies of the multitimescale decision process inherent in joint optimization in VDTN, specifically investigating the dynamic interplay between control and communication. To facilitate the joint optimization, we define two Value of Information (VoI) concepts rooted in control performance. Subsequently, utilizing VoI as a bridge between control and communication, we introduce a novel joint optimization framework, which involves iterative processing of two Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) modules corresponding to control and communication to derive the optimal policy.

As an effective way to model language, image, video, and other modalities, the use of LLMs for end-to-end extraction of structured visual representations, such as scene graphs, remains underexplored. It requires the model to accurately produce a set of objects and relationship triplets, rather than generating text token by token. To achieve this, we introduce R1-SGG, a multimodal LLM (M-LLM) initially trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the scene graph dataset and subsequently refined using reinforcement learning to enhance its ability to generate scene graphs in an end-to-end manner. The SFT follows a conventional prompt-response paradigm, while RL requires the design of effective reward signals. We design a set of graph-centric rewards, including three recall-based variants -- Hard Recall, Hard Recall+Relax, and Soft Recall -- which evaluate semantic and spatial alignment between predictions and ground truth at the object and relation levels. A format consistency reward further ensures that outputs follow the expected structural schema. Extensive experiments on the VG150 and PSG benchmarks show that R1-SGG substantially reduces failure rates and achieves strong performance in Recall and mean Recall, surpassing traditional SGG models and existing multimodal language models.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability in dynamic scenarios hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan -- a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.

The noise in RL exhibits a Markovian structure, and in some cases, such as gradient temporal difference (GTD) methods, SA is employed in a two-time-scale framework. This combination introduces significant theoretical challenges for analysis. We derive an upper bound on the error for the iterations of linear two-time-scale SA with Markovian noise. We demonstrate that the mean squared error decreases as $trace (\Sigma^y)/k + o(1/k)$ where $k$ is the number of iterates, and $\Sigma^y$ is an appropriately defined covariance matrix. A key feature of our bounds is that the leading term, $\Sigma^y$, exactly matches with the covariance in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for the two-time-scale SA, and we call them tight finite-time bounds. We illustrate their use in RL by establishing sample complexity for off-policy algorithms, TDC, GTD, and GTD2. A special case of linear two-time-scale SA that is extensively studied is linear SA with Polyak-Ruppert averaging. We present tight finite time bounds corresponding to the covariance matrix of the CLT. Such bounds can be used to study TD-learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging.</p></details> | 83 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Moral Alignment for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01639v4)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making agents based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across various domains of human activity. While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are underway to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and their transparency will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital. The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit, opaque and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly and transparently encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents. We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of Deontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents in terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) environment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an agent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that certain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other matrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with intrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to human values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to currently predominant alignment techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR'25), Singapore, Apr 2025. https://openreview.net/forum?id=MeGDmZjUXy</p></details> |

Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Si introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.

However, the efficacy of such strategies is influenced by the background climate and their implementation may potentially alter both the indoor climate and local urban climate. This study proposes an integrated framework combining RL with an urban climate model that incorporates a building energy model, aiming to evaluate the efficacy of RL-based HVAC control across different background climates, impacts of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban climate, and the transferability of RL strategies across cities. Our findings reveal that the reward (defined as a weighted combination of energy consumption and thermal comfort) and the impacts of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban climate exhibit marked variability across cities with different background climates. The sensitivity of reward weights and the transferability of RL strategies are also strongly influenced by the background climate. Cities in hot climates tend to achieve higher rewards across most reward weight configurations that balance energy consumption and thermal comfort, and those cities with more varying atmospheric temperatures demonstrate greater RL strategy transferability. These findings underscore the importance of thoroughly evaluating RL-based HVAC control strategies in diverse climatic contexts. This study also provides a new insight that city-to-city learning will potentially aid the deployment of RL-based HVAC control.</p></details> |  |

However, the nonlinear nature of complex systems and the presence of non-Gaussian noises pose significant challenges to the performance of conventional filtering methods in terms of estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. In this work, we present a data-driven closed-loop filter, termed datatic approximate optimal filter (DAOF), specifically designed for nonlinear systems under non-Gaussian conditions. We first formulate a Markovian filtering problem (MFP), which inherently shares a connection with reinforcement learning (RL) as it aims to compute the optimal state estimate by minimizing the accumulated error. To solve MFP, we propose DAOF, which primarily incorporates a trained RL policy and features two distinct structural designs: DAOF-v1 and DAOF-v2. Designed for systems with explicit models, DAOF-v1 combines prediction and update phases, with the RL policy generating the update value. Meanwhile, DAOF-v2 bypasses system modeling by directly outputting the state estimate. Then, we utilize an actor-critic algorithm to learn the parameterized policy for DAOF. Experimental results on a 2-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) vehicle system, equipped with explicit system models, demonstrate the superior accuracy and computational efficiency of DAOF-v1 compared to existing nonlinear filters. Moreover, DAOF-v2 showcases its unique ability to perform filtering without requiring explicit system modeling, as validated by a 14-DOF vehicle system.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Application-Specific TCP Congestion-Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07042v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Congestion Control (CC) module plays a critical role in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), ensuring the stability and efficiency of network data transmission. The CC approaches that are commonly used these days employ heuristics-based rules to adjust the sending rate. Due to their heuristics-based nature, these approaches are not only unable to adapt to changing network conditions but are also agnostic to the diverse requirements that different applications often have. Recently, several learning-based CC approaches have been proposed to adapt to changing network conditions. Unfortunately, they are not designed to take application requirements into account. Prior heuristics-based as well as learning-based CC approaches focus on achieving a singular objective, which is often to maximize throughput, even though a lot of applications care more about latency, packet losses, jitter, and different combinations of various network metrics. Motivated by this, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based CC framework, namely ASC, which allows any application to specify any arbitrary objectives that the network traffic of that application should achieve and is able to swiftly adapt to the changes in the objectives of the applications as well as to the changes in the network conditions. Our ASC framework further employs a client-server architecture that serves two purposes: 1) it makes ASC highly scalable in terms of the arrival and departure of TCP connections, and 2) it makes ASC very lightweight for the nodes maintaining the TCP connections. We implemented and extensively evaluated ASC in a variety of settings. Our results show that it can not only achieve various objectives but also outperforms prior approaches even in the specific objectives that those approaches were designed to achieve.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions, such as retraining or fine-tuning on additional data, demand significant computational resources and labor-intensive data collection, while ensemble-based methods incur additional costs by introducing auxiliary VLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time adaptation framework using reinforcement learning to mitigate hallucinations during inference without retraining or any auxiliary VLMs. By updating only the learnable parameters in the layer normalization of the language model (approximately 0.003% of the model parameters), our method reduces distribution shifts between test samples and pretraining samples. A CLIP-based hallucination evaluation model is proposed to provide dual rewards to VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate a 15.4% and 17.3% reduction in hallucination rates on LLaVA and InstructBLIP, respectively. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a 68.3% improvement in hallucination mitigation, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Cooperative Air-Ground-Human Crowdsensing in Emergency Rescue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06997v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile crowdsensing is evolving beyond traditional human-centric models by integrating heterogeneous entities like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Optimizing task allocation among these diverse agents is critical, particularly in challenging emergency rescue scenarios characterized by complex environments, limited communication, and partial observability. This paper tackles the Heterogeneous-Entity Collaborative-Sensing Task Allocation (HECTA) problem specifically for emergency rescue, considering humans, UAVs, and UGVs. We introduce a novel ``Hard-Cooperative'' policy where UGVs prioritize recharging low-battery UAVs, alongside performing their sensing tasks. The primary objective is maximizing the task completion rate (TCR) under strict time constraints. We rigorously formulate this NP-hard problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) to effectively handle sequential decision-making under uncertainty. To solve this, we propose HECTA4ER, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm built upon a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution architecture. HECTA4ER incorporates tailored designs, including specialized modules for complex feature extraction, utilization of action-observation history via hidden states, and a mixing network integrating global and local information, specifically addressing the challenges of partial observability. Furthermore, theoretical analysis confirms the algorithm's convergence properties. Extensive simulations demonstrate that HECTA4ER significantly outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an average 18.42% increase in TCR. Crucially, a real-world case study validates the algorithm's effectiveness and robustness in dynamic sensing scenarios, highlighting its strong potential for practical application in emergency response.</p></details> |  |

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |
| **[Learning Value of Information towards Joint Communication and Control in 6G V2X](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06978v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) evolves towards future sixth-generation (6G) networks, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are emerging to become a key application. Leveraging data-driven Machine Learning (ML), especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), is expected to significantly enhance CAV decision-making in both vehicle control and V2X communication under uncertainty. These two decision-making processes are closely intertwined, with the value of information (VoI) acting as a crucial bridge between them. In this paper, we introduce Sequential Stochastic Decision Process (SSDP) models to define and assess VoI, demonstrating their application in optimizing communication systems for CAVs. Specifically, we formally define the SSDP model and demonstrate that the MDP model is a special case of it. The SSDP model offers a key advantage by explicitly representing the set of information that can enhance decision-making when available. Furthermore, as current research on VoI remains fragmented, we propose a systematic VoI modeling framework grounded in the MDP, Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Optimal Control theories. We define different categories of VoI and discuss their corresponding estimation methods. Finally, we present a structured approach to leverage the various VoI metrics for optimizing the ``When", ``What", and ``How" to communicate problems. For this purpose, SSDP models are formulated with VoI-associated reward functions derived from VoI-based optimization objectives. While we use a simple vehicle-following control problem to illustrate the proposed methodology, it holds significant potential to facilitate the joint optimization of stochastic, sequential control and communication decisions in a wide range of networked control systems.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on the inherent human estimating process, the proposed method reframes the landing task as an optimization problem. The UAV employs variations in the visual characteristics of a specially designed lenticular circle on the landing pad, where the perceived color and form provide critical information for estimating both altitude and depth. Reinforcement learning algorithms are utilized to approximate the functions governing these estimations, enabling the UAV to ascertain ideal landing settings via training. This method's efficacy is assessed by simulations and experiments, showcasing its potential for robust and accurate autonomous landing without dependence on complex sensor setups. This research contributes to the advancement of cost-effective and efficient UAV landing solutions, paving the way for wider applicability across various fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward-free World Models for Online Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14081v5)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to acquire skills directly from expert demonstrations, providing a compelling alternative to reinforcement learning. However, prior online IL approaches struggle with complex tasks characterized by high-dimensional inputs and complex dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel approach to online imitation learning that leverages reward-free world models. Our method learns environmental dynamics entirely in latent spaces without reconstruction, enabling efficient and accurate modeling. We adopt the inverse soft-Q learning objective, reformulating the optimization process in the Q-policy space to mitigate the instability associated with traditional optimization in the reward-policy space. By employing a learned latent dynamics model and planning for control, our approach consistently achieves stable, expert-level performance in tasks with high-dimensional observation or action spaces and intricate dynamics. We evaluate our method on a diverse set of benchmarks, including DMControl, MyoSuite, and ManiSkill2, demonstrating superior empirical performance compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025; Code available at: https://github.com/TobyLeelsz/iqmpc</p></details> |

On the contrary, we follow the design principle of "less is more", striving to simplify the process while maintaining effectiveness. In this work, we propose an end-to-end agile tracking and navigation framework for quadrotors that directly maps the sensory observations to control commands. Importantly, leveraging the multimodal nature of navigation and detection tasks, our network maintains interpretability by explicitly integrating the independent modules of the traditional pipeline, rather than a crude action regression. In detail, we adopt a set of motion primitives as anchors to cover the searching space regarding the feasible region and potential target. Then we reformulate the trajectory optimization as regression of primitive offsets and associated costs considering the safety, smoothness, and other metrics. For tracking task, the trajectories are expected to approach the target and additional objectness scores are predicted. Subsequently, the predictions, after compensation for the estimated lumped disturbance, are transformed into thrust and attitude as control commands for swift response. During training, we seamlessly integrate traditional motion planning with deep learning by directly back-propagating the gradients of trajectory costs to the network, eliminating the need for expert demonstration in imitation learning and providing more direct guidance than reinforcement learning. Finally, we deploy the algorithm on a compact quadrotor and conduct real-world validations in both forest and building environments to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

ML models, especially artificial neural networks (ANNs), can provide advanced decision-making and control capabilities by learning from data. However, they often function as black boxes, making it challenging to interpret them. This is especially a problem in safety-critical control applications. To generate realistic CFEs, we parameterize the LiDAR space with simple shapes such as circles and rectangles, whose parameters are chosen by a genetic algorithm, and the configurations are transformed into LiDAR data by raycasting. Our model-agnostic approach generates CFEs in the form of synthetic LiDAR data that resembles a base LiDAR state but is modified to produce a pre-defined ML model control output based on a query from the user. We demonstrate our method on a mobile robot, the TurtleBot3, controlled using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in real-world and simulated scenarios. Our method generates logical and realistic CFEs, which helps to interpret the DRL agent's decision making. This paper contributes towards advancing explainable AI in mobile robotics, and our method could be a tool for understanding, debugging, and improving ML-based autonomous control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2025 European Control Conference (ECC)</p></details> |

Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI), which involves intelligent systems with physical presence and real-time interaction with the environment, has emerged as a key research direction in pursuit of AGI. While advancements in deep learning, reinforcement learning, large-scale language models, and multimodal technologies have significantly contributed to the progress of EAI, most existing reviews focus on specific technologies or applications. A systematic overview, particularly one that explores the direct connection between EAI and AGI, remains scarce. This paper examines EAI as a foundational approach to AGI, systematically analyzing its four core modules: perception, intelligent decision-making, action, and feedback. We provide a detailed discussion of how each module contributes to the six core principles of AGI. Additionally, we discuss future trends, challenges, and research directions in EAI, emphasizing its potential as a cornerstone for AGI development. Our findings suggest that EAI's integration of dynamic learning and real-world interaction is essential for bridging the gap between narrow AI and AGI.</p></details> | <details><summary>19pag...</summary><p>19pages,7 figures,3 tables</p></details> |

In humans, inner speech structures thought processes and decision-making; in robotics, it improves explainability by making reasoning explicit. This is crucial in healthcare scenarios, where trust in robotic assistants depends on both accurate recommendations and human-like dialogue, which make interactions more natural and engaging. Building on this, we developed a social robot that provides dietary advice, and we provided the architecture with inner speech capabilities to validate user input, refine reasoning, and generate clear justifications. The system integrates large language models for natural language understanding and a knowledge graph for structured dietary information. By making decisions more transparent, our approach strengthens trust and improves human-robot interaction in healthcare. We validated this by measuring the computational efficiency of our architecture and conducting a small user study, which assessed the reliability of inner speech in explaining the robot's behavior.</p></details> |  |

However, these policies remain highly sensitive to domain shifts stemming from background or robot embodiment changes, which limits their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we present ARRO, a novel calibration-free visual representation that leverages zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation and object detection models to efficiently mask out task-irrelevant regions of the scene without requiring additional training. By filtering visual distractors and overlaying virtual guides during both training and inference, ARRO improves robustness to scene variations and reduces the need for additional data collection. We extensively evaluate ARRO with Diffusion Policy on several tabletop manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments, and further demonstrate its compatibility and effectiveness with generalist robot policies, such as Octo and OpenVLA. Across all settings in our evaluation, ARRO yields consistent performance gains, allows for selective masking to choose between different objects, and shows robustness even to challenging segmentation conditions.

We address these limitations by integrating DMP controllers into a BT framework, jointly learning the BT structure and DMP actions from single demonstrations, thereby removing the need for predefined actions. Additionally, by combining BT decision logic with DMP motion generation, our method enhances policy interpretability, modularity, and adaptability for autonomous systems. Our approach readily affords both learning to replicate low-level motions and combining partial demonstrations into a coherent and easy-to-modify overall policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, accepted (not yet published) at IAS19 2025 conference</p></details> |

Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, while building on top of general Vision-Language Models (VLMs), still fall short of achieving robust zero-shot performance due to the scarcity and heterogeneity prevalent in embodied datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FSD (From Seeing to Doing), a novel vision-language model that generates intermediate representations through spatial relationship reasoning, providing fine-grained guidance for robotic manipulation. Our approach combines a hierarchical data pipeline for training with a self-consistency mechanism that aligns spatial coordinates with visual signals. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively validated FSD's capabilities in both "seeing" and "doing," achieving outstanding performance across 8 benchmarks for general spatial reasoning and embodied reference abilities, as well as on our proposed more challenging benchmark VABench. We also verified zero-shot capabilities in robot manipulation, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods in both SimplerEnv and real robot settings. Experimental results show that FSD achieves 54.1% success rate in SimplerEnv and 72% success rate across 8 real-world tasks, outperforming the strongest baseline by 30%.</p></details> | Early version |
| **[Achieving Scalable Robot Autonomy via neurosymbolic planning using lightweight local LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08492v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>PDDL-based symbolic task planning remains pivotal for robot autonomy yet struggles with dynamic human-robot collaboration due to scalability, re-planning demands, and delayed plan availability. Although a few neurosymbolic frameworks have previously leveraged LLMs such as GPT-3 to address these challenges, reliance on closed-source, remote models with limited context introduced critical constraints: third-party dependency, inconsistent response times, restricted plan length and complexity, and multi-domain scalability issues. We present Gideon, a novel framework that enables the transition to modern, smaller, local LLMs with extended context length. Gideon integrates a novel problem generator to systematically generate large-scale datasets of realistic domain-problem-plan tuples for any domain, and adapts neurosymbolic planning for local LLMs, enabling on-device execution and extended context for multi-domain support. Preliminary experiments in single-domain scenarios performed on Qwen-2.5 1.5B and trained on 8k-32k samples, demonstrate a valid plan percentage of 66.1% (32k model) and show that the figure can be further scaled through additional data. Multi-domain tests on 16k samples yield an even higher 70.6% planning validity rate, proving extensibility across domains and signaling that data variety can have a positive effect on learning efficiency. Although long-horizon planning and reduced model size make Gideon training much less efficient than baseline models based on larger LLMs, the results are still significant considering that the trained model is about 120x smaller than baseline and that significant advantages can be achieved in inference efficiency, scalability, and multi-domain adaptability, all critical factors in human-robot collaboration. Training inefficiency can be mitigated by Gideon's streamlined data generation pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, accepted at IAS 2025</p></details> |

However, current VLA models face significant challenges: they are slow during inference and require extensive pre-training on large amounts of robotic data, making real-world deployment difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new family of compact vision-language-action models, called TinyVLA, which offers two key advantages over existing VLA models: (1) faster inference speeds, and (2) improved data efficiency, eliminating the need for pre-training stage. Our framework incorporates two essential components to build TinyVLA: (1) initializing the policy backbone with robust, high-speed multimodal models, and (2) integrating a diffusion policy decoder during fine-tuning to enable precise robot actions. We conducted extensive evaluations of TinyVLA in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model, OpenVLA, in terms of speed and data efficiency, while delivering comparable or superior performance. Additionally, TinyVLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various dimensions, including language instructions, novel objects, unseen positions, changes in object appearance, background variations, and environmental shifts, often matching or exceeding the performance of OpenVLA. We believe that \methodname offers an interesting perspective on utilizing pre-trained multimodal models for policy learning.

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is separable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such as laundry folding.

Traditional approaches fail to address dynamic rescheduling or diverse service requirements, typically restricting robots to single-task types. This paper tackles the Multi-Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (MPDPTW), where autonomous mobile robots are capable of handling varied service requests. The objective is to minimize late delivery penalties while maximizing task completion rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework leveraging a heterogeneous robot team and an efficient dynamic scheduling algorithm that supports dynamic task rescheduling. Users submit requests with specific time constraints, and our decentralized algorithm, Heterogeneous Mobile Robots Online Diverse Task Allocation (HMR-ODTA), optimizes task assignments to ensure timely service while addressing delays or task rejections. Extensive simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness. For smaller task sets (40-160 tasks), penalties were reduced by nearly 63%, while for larger sets (160-280 tasks), penalties decreased by approximately 50%. These results highlight the algorithm's effectiveness in improving task scheduling and coordination in multi-robot systems, offering a robust solution for enhancing delivery performance in structured, time-critical environments.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often rely on dense training datasets or explicit geometric modeling, limiting their scalability to real-world tasks. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offer new possibilities for integrating vision and language understanding, but their application to autonomous robotic grasping remains largely unexplored. We present ORACLE-Grasp, a zero-shot framework that leverages LMMs as semantic oracles to guide grasp selection without requiring additional training or human input. The system formulates grasp prediction as a structured, iterative decision process, using dual-prompt tool calling to first extract high-level object context and then select task-relevant grasp regions. By discretizing the image space and reasoning over candidate areas, ORACLE-Grasp mitigates the spatial imprecision common in LMMs and produces human-like, task-driven grasp suggestions. Early stopping and depth-based refinement steps further enhance efficiency and physical grasp reliability. Experiments demonstrate that the predicted grasps achieve low positional and orientation errors relative to human-annotated ground truth and lead to high success rates in real-world pick up tasks. These results highlight the potential of combining language-driven reasoning with lightweight vision techniques to enable robust, autonomous grasping without task-specific datasets or retraining.</p></details> |  |

Central to our approach is a next-token prediction objective, enabling the model to reason effectively over the user's query in the context of current observations. Subsequently, a diffusion model is attached to generate robust action outputs. To enhance policy learning through self-reasoning, we introduce a novel reasoning injection module that integrates reasoning phrases directly into the policy learning process. The whole framework is simple and flexible, making it easy to deploy and upgrade. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple real robots to validate the effectiveness of DiffusionVLA. Our tests include a challenging factory sorting task, where DiffusionVLA successfully categorizes objects, including those not seen during training. We observe that the reasoning module makes the model interpretable. It allows observers to understand the model thought process and identify potential causes of policy failures. Additionally, we test DiffusionVLA on a zero-shot bin-picking task, achieving 63.7\% accuracy on 102 previously unseen objects. Our method demonstrates robustness to visual changes, such as distractors and new backgrounds, and easily adapts to new embodiments. Furthermore, DiffusionVLA can follow novel instructions and retain conversational ability. Notably, DiffusionVLA is data-efficient and fast at inference; our smallest DiffusionVLA-2B runs 82Hz on a single A6000 GPU and can train from scratch on less than 50 demonstrations for a complex task. Finally, we scale the model from 2B to 72B parameters, showcasing improved generalization capabilities with increased model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project page is available at: http://diffusion-vla.github.io</p></details> |

However, there is currently limited research on how to optimize diffusion-based polices (e.g., Diffusion Policy) fast and stably. In this paper, we propose an Adam-based Diffusion Policy Optimization (ADPO), a fast algorithmic framework containing best practices for fine-tuning diffusion-based polices in robotic control tasks using the adaptive gradient descent method in RL. Adaptive gradient method is less studied in training RL, let alone diffusion-based policies. We confirm that ADPO outperforms other diffusion-based RL methods in terms of overall effectiveness for fine-tuning on standard robotic tasks. Concretely, we conduct extensive experiments on standard robotic control tasks to test ADPO, where, particularly, six popular diffusion-based RL methods are provided as benchmark methods. Experimental results show that ADPO acquires better or comparable performance than the baseline methods. Finally, we systematically analyze the sensitivity of multiple hyperparameters in standard robotics tasks, providing guidance for subsequent practical applications. Our video demonstrations are released in https://github.com/Timeless-lab/ADPO.git.</p></details> |  |

However, the improper frame sampling method and low training efficiency of current methods remain a critical bottleneck, resulting in substantial computational overhead and time costs. To address this limitation, we propose Motion-aware Rapid Reward Optimization for Efficient Robot Skill Learning from Single Videos (MA-ROESL). MA-ROESL integrates a motion-aware frame selection method to implicitly enhance the quality of VLM-generated reward functions. It further employs a hybrid three-phase training pipeline that improves training efficiency via rapid reward optimization and derives the final policy through online fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that MA-ROESL significantly enhances training efficiency while faithfully reproducing locomotion skills in both simulated and real-world settings, thereby underscoring its potential as a robust and scalable framework for efficient robot locomotion skill learning from video demonstrations.</p></details> |  |
| **[ERPoT: Effective and Reliable Pose Tracking for Mobile Robots Using Lightweight Polygon Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14723v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an effective and reliable pose tracking solution, termed ERPoT, for mobile robots operating in large-scale outdoor and challenging indoor environments, underpinned by an innovative prior polygon map. Especially, to overcome the challenge that arises as the map size grows with the expansion of the environment, the novel form of a prior map composed of multiple polygons is proposed. Benefiting from the use of polygons to concisely and accurately depict environmental occupancy, the prior polygon map achieves long-term reliable pose tracking while ensuring a compact form. More importantly, pose tracking is carried out under pure LiDAR mode, and the dense 3D point cloud is transformed into a sparse 2D scan through ground removal and obstacle selection. On this basis, a novel cost function for pose estimation through point-polygon matching is introduced, encompassing two distinct constraint forms: point-to-vertex and point-to-edge. In this study, our primary focus lies on two crucial aspects: lightweight and compact prior map construction, as well as effective and reliable robot pose tracking. Both aspects serve as the foundational pillars for future navigation across diverse mobile platforms equipped with different LiDAR sensors in varied environments. Comparative experiments based on the publicly available datasets and our self-recorded datasets are conducted, and evaluation results show the superior performance of ERPoT on reliability, prior map size, pose estimation error, and runtime over the other six approaches.

Observers based on proprioceptive information can be used for contact detection but have first-order error dynamics, which results in delays. Sensor fusion based on inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of accelerometers and gyroscopes is advantageous for reducing delays. The acceleration estimation enables the direct calculation of external forces. For serial robots, the installation of multiple accelerometers and gyroscopes is required for dynamics modeling since the joint coordinates are the minimal coordinates. Alternatively, parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential to use only one IMU on the end-effector platform, which already presents the minimal coordinates of the PR. This work introduces a sensor-fusion method for contact detection using encoders and only one low-cost, consumer-grade IMU for a PR. The end-effector accelerations are estimated by an extended Kalman filter and incorporated into the dynamics to calculate external forces. In real-world experiments with a planar PR, we demonstrate that this approach reduces the detection duration by up to 50% compared to a momentum observer and enables the collision and clamping detection within 3-39ms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of a publication accepted for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

However, two issues need to be considered when applying it in field environments: one is resource limitation, and the other is inter/intra-robot association. The resource limitation issue arises when the data size exceeds the processing capacity of the network or memory, especially when utilizing communication systems or onboard computers in the field. The inter/intra-robot association issue occurs due to the narrow convergence region of ICP under large viewpoint differences, triggering many false positive loops and ultimately resulting in an inconsistent global map for multi-robot systems. To tackle these problems, we propose a distributed LiDAR SLAM framework designed for versatile field applications, called SKiD-SLAM. Extending our previous work that solely focused on lightweight place recognition and fast and robust global registration, we present a multi-robot mapping framework that focuses on robust and lightweight inter-robot loop closure in distributed LiDAR SLAM. Through various environmental experiments, we demonstrate that our method is more robust and lightweight compared to other state-of-the-art distributed SLAM approaches, overcoming resource limitation and inter/intra-robot association issues. Also, we validated the field applicability of our approach through mapping experiments in real-world planetary emulation terrain and cave environments, which are in-house datasets. Our code will be available at https://sparolab.github.io/research/skid_slam/.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Rethink Repeatable Measures of Robot Performance with Statistical Query](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08216v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a general standardized testing algorithm designed to evaluate a specific aspect of a robot's performance, several key expectations are commonly imposed. Beyond accuracy (i.e., closeness to a typically unknown ground-truth reference) and efficiency (i.e., feasibility within acceptable testing costs and equipment constraints), one particularly important attribute is repeatability. Repeatability refers to the ability to consistently obtain the same testing outcome when similar testing algorithms are executed on the same subject robot by different stakeholders, across different times or locations. However, achieving repeatable testing has become increasingly challenging as the components involved grow more complex, intelligent, diverse, and, most importantly, stochastic. While related efforts have addressed repeatability at ethical, hardware, and procedural levels, this study focuses specifically on repeatable testing at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we target the well-adopted class of testing algorithms in standardized evaluation: statistical query (SQ) algorithms (i.e., algorithms that estimate the expected value of a bounded function over a distribution using sampled data). We propose a lightweight, parameterized, and adaptive modification applicable to any SQ routine, whether based on Monte Carlo sampling, importance sampling, or adaptive importance sampling, that makes it provably repeatable, with guaranteed bounds on both accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three representative scenarios: (i) established and widely adopted standardized testing of manipulators, (ii) emerging intelligent testing algorithms for operational risk assessment in automated vehicles, and (iii) developing use cases involving command tracking performance evaluation of humanoid robots in locomotion tasks.</p></details> |  |

Current BC approaches often enhance generalization by leveraging large datasets and incorporating additional visual and textual modalities to capture more diverse information. However, these methods overlook whether the learned representations contain redundant information and lack a solid theoretical foundation to guide the learning process. To address these limitations, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective and introduce mutual information to quantify and mitigate redundancy in latent representations. Building on this, we incorporate the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle into BC, which extends the idea of reducing redundancy by providing a structured framework for compressing irrelevant information while preserving task-relevant features. This work presents the first comprehensive study on redundancy in latent representations across various methods, backbones, and experimental settings, while extending the generalizability of the IB to BC. Extensive experiments and analyses on the CortexBench and LIBERO benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements with IB, underscoring the importance of reducing input data redundancy and highlighting its practical value for more practical applications.

However, existing neural architectures that support heterogeneous teaming tend to force a trade-off between expressivity and efficiency. Shared-parameter designs prioritize sample efficiency by enabling a single network to be shared across all or a pre-specified subset of robots (via input augmentations), but tend to limit behavioral diversity. In contrast, recent designs employ a separate policy for each robot, enabling greater diversity and expressivity at the cost of efficiency and generalization. Our key insight is that such tradeoffs can be avoided by viewing these design choices as ends of a broad spectrum. Inspired by recent work in transfer and meta learning, and building on prior work in multi-robot task allocation, we propose Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a soft weight sharing architecture that uses hypernetworks to efficiently learn a flexible shared policy that dynamically adapts to each robot post-training. By explicitly encoding the impact of robot capabilities (e.g., speed and payload) on collective behavior, CASH enables zero-shot generalization to unseen robots or team compositions. Our experiments involve multiple heterogeneous tasks, three learning paradigms (imitation learning, value-based, and policy-gradient RL), and SOTA multi-robot simulation (JaxMARL) and hardware (Robotarium) platforms. Across all conditions, we find that CASH generates appropriately-diverse behaviors and consistently outperforms baseline architectures in terms of performance and sample efficiency during both training and zero-shot generalization, all with 60%-80% fewer learnable parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, equal authorship between Kevin Fu and Shalin Anand Jain</p></details> |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning for Robotic Leaf Manipulation: A Hybrid Geometric-Neural Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03702v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating leaf manipulation in agricultural settings faces significant challenges, including the variability of plant morphologies and deformable leaves. We propose a novel hybrid geometric-neural approach for autonomous leaf grasping that combines traditional computer vision with neural networks through self-supervised learning. Our method integrates YOLOv8 for instance segmentation and RAFT-Stereo for 3D depth estimation to build rich leaf representations, which feed into both a geometric feature scoring pipeline and a neural refinement module (GraspPointCNN). The key innovation is our confidence-weighted fusion mechanism that dynamically balances the contribution of each approach based on prediction certainty. Our self-supervised framework uses the geometric pipeline as an expert teacher to automatically generate training data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves an 88.0% success rate in controlled environments and 84.7% in real greenhouse conditions, significantly outperforming both purely geometric (75.3%) and neural (60.2%) methods. This work establishes a new paradigm for agricultural robotics where domain expertise is seamlessly integrated with machine learning capabilities, providing a foundation for fully automated crop monitoring systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[What Matters for Batch Online Reinforcement Learning in Robotics?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08078v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to learn from large batches of autonomously collected data for policy improvement -- a paradigm we refer to as batch online reinforcement learning -- holds the promise of enabling truly scalable robot learning by significantly reducing the need for human effort of data collection while getting benefits from self-improvement. Yet, despite the promise of this paradigm, it remains challenging to achieve due to algorithms not being able to learn effectively from the autonomous data. For example, prior works have applied imitation learning and filtered imitation learning methods to the batch online RL problem, but these algorithms often fail to efficiently improve from the autonomously collected data or converge quickly to a suboptimal point. This raises the question of what matters for effective batch online RL in robotics. Motivated by this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of three axes -- (i) algorithm class, (ii) policy extraction methods, and (iii) policy expressivity -- and analyze how these axes affect performance and scaling with the amount of autonomous data. Through our analysis, we make several observations. First, we observe that the use of Q-functions to guide batch online RL significantly improves performance over imitation-based methods. Building on this, we show that an implicit method of policy extraction -- via choosing the best action in the distribution of the policy -- is necessary over traditional policy extraction methods from offline RL. Next, we show that an expressive policy class is preferred over less expressive policy classes. Based on this analysis, we propose a general recipe for effective batch online RL. We then show a simple addition to the recipe of using temporally-correlated noise to obtain more diversity results in further performance gains. Our recipe obtains significantly better performance and scaling compared to prior methods.</p></details> |  |

This integration presents both unprecedented opportunities and notable challenges for effective collaboration. However, the active guidance of human actions and their integration in co-learning processes, where humans and robots mutually learn from each other, remains under-explored. This article demonstrates how consensus between human and robot opinions can be established by modeling decision-making processes as non-linear opinion dynamics. We utilize dynamic bias as a control parameter to steer the robot's opinion toward consensus and employ visual cues via a robotic eye gaze to guide human decisions. These non-verbal cues communicate the robot's future intentions, gradually guiding human decisions to align with them. To design robot behavior for consensus, we integrate a human opinion observation algorithm with the robot's opinion formation, controlling its actions based on that formed opinion. Experiments with $51$ participants ($N=51$) in a two-choice decision-making task show that effective consensus and trust can be established in a human--robot co-learning setting by guiding human decisions through nonverbal robotic cues and using bias-controlled opinion dynamics to shape robot behavior. Finally, we provide detailed information on the perceived cognitive load and the behavior of robotic eyes based on user feedback and post-experiment interviews.</p></details> | 48 pages, 8 figures |

However, controlling their behavior is challenging due to their nonlinear material response and infinite degrees of freedom. A potential solution to these challenges is to discretize the infinite-dimensional configuration space into a finite but sufficiently large number of functional modes with programmed dynamics. We present a strategy for co-designing the desired tasks and morphology of pneumatically actuated soft robots with multiple encoded stable states and dynamic responses. Our approach introduces a general method to capture the soft robots' response using an energy-based analytical model, the parameters of which are obtained using Recursive Feature Elimination. The resulting lumped-parameter model facilitates inverse co-design of the robot's morphology and planned tasks by embodying specific dynamics upon actuation. We illustrate our approach's ability to explore the configuration space by co-designing kinematics with optimized stiffnesses and time responses to obtain robots capable of classifying the size and weight of objects and displaying adaptable locomotion with minimal feedback control. This strategy offers a framework for simplifying the control of soft robots by exploiting the nonlinear mechanics of multistable structures and embodying mechanical intelligence into soft material systems</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript: 13 pages, 5 figures ; Supplementary Information: 9 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates text-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot control. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric representation-can be extracted from videos in a self-supervised manner, enabling diffusion model training on web-scale video-caption data. Treating generated pixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level System 1 module translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action mapping functions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal supervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse temporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal intervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and generalizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings, bridging the gap between language, motion, and action.

While teleoperation provides high-fidelity datasets, its high cost limits its scalability. Instead, what if people could use their own hands, just as they do in everyday life, to collect data? In DexWild, a diverse team of data collectors uses their hands to collect hours of interactions across a multitude of environments and objects. To record this data, we create DexWild-System, a low-cost, mobile, and easy-to-use device. The DexWild learning framework co-trains on both human and robot demonstrations, leading to improved performance compared to training on each dataset individually. This combination results in robust robot policies capable of generalizing to novel environments, tasks, and embodiments with minimal additional robot-specific data. Experimental results demonstrate that DexWild significantly improves performance, achieving a 68.5% success rate in unseen environments-nearly four times higher than policies trained with robot data only-and offering 5.8x better cross-embodiment generalization.

However, its traditional implementation as a singular static unit limits its dynamic range and application versatility. This paper introduces AcoustoBots - a novel convergence of acoustophoresis with a movable and reconfigurable phased array of transducers for enhanced application versatility. We mount a phased array of transducers on a swarm of robots to harness the benefits of multiple mobile acoustophoretic units. This offers a more flexible and interactive platform that enables a swarm of acoustophoretic multimodal interactions. Our novel AcoustoBots design includes a hinge actuation system that controls the orientation of the mounted phased array of transducers to achieve high flexibility in a swarm of acoustophoretic multimodal interactions. In addition, we designed a BeadDispenserBot that can deliver particles to trapping locations, which automates the acoustic levitation interaction. These attributes allow AcoustoBots to independently work for a common cause and interchange between modalities, allowing for novel augmentations (e.g., a swarm of haptics, audio, and levitation) and bilateral interactions with users in an expanded interaction area. We detail our design considerations, challenges, and methodological approach to extend acoustophoretic central control in distributed settings. This work demonstrates a scalable acoustic control framework with two mobile robots, laying the groundwork for future deployment in larger robotic swarms. Finally, we characterize the performance of our AcoustoBots and explore the potential interactive scenarios they can enable.</p></details> |  |

However, many robotic downstream tasks require the use of cameras, which may raise privacy risks. To better understand user perceptions of privacy in relation to visual data, we conducted a user study investigating how different image modalities and image resolutions affect users' privacy concerns. The results show that depth images are broadly viewed as privacy-safe, and a similarly high proportion of respondents feel the same about semantic segmentation images. Additionally, the majority of participants consider 32*32 resolution RGB images to be almost sufficiently privacy-preserving, while most believe that 16*16 resolution can fully guarantee privacy protection.</p></details> |  |

This study presents hazard driven low-level control strategies implemented in robot-assisted dressing (RAD) scenarios where hazards like garment snags and user discomfort in real-time can affect task performance and user safety. The proposed control mechanisms include: (1) Garment Snagging Control Strategy, which detects excessive forces and either seeks user intervention via a chatbot or autonomously adjusts its trajectory, and (2) User Discomfort/Pain Mitigation Strategy, which dynamically reduces velocity based on user feedback and aborts the task if necessary. We used physical dressing trials in order to evaluate these control strategies. Results confirm that integrating force monitoring with user feedback improves safety and task continuity. The findings emphasise the need for hybrid approaches that balance autonomous intervention, user involvement, and controlled task termination, supported by bi-directional interaction and real-time user-driven adaptability, paving the way for more responsive and personalised HRI systems.</p></details> |  |

This approach emulates the intuitiveness of physical human-robot interaction, but at the same time it permits to teleoperate the robot from a safe distance, in a way that resembles a "Marionette" interface. The system is further enhanced with wearable haptic feedback functions to align better with the "Marionette" metaphor, and a user study has been conducted to validate its efficacy with and without the haptic channel enabled. Considering the importance of robot independence, the TelePhysicalOperation interface incorporates autonomy modules to face, for example, the teleoperation of dual-arm mobile base robots for bimanual object grasping and transportation tasks. With the laser-guided interface, the user can indicate points of interest to the robot through the utilization of a simple but effective laser emitter device. With a neural network-based vision system, the robot tracks the laser projection in real time, allowing the user to indicate not only fixed goals, like objects, but also paths to follow. With the implemented autonomous behavior, a mobile manipulator employs its locomanipulation abilities to follow the indicated goals. The behavior is modeled using Behavior Trees, exploiting their reactivity to promptly respond to changes in goal positions, and their modularity to adapt the motion planning to the task needs. The proposed laser interface has also been employed in an assistive scenario. In this case, users with upper limbs impairments can control an assistive manipulator by directing a head-worn laser emitter to the point of interests, to collaboratively address activities of everyday life.

In contrast, humans are able to learn efficiently by watching others interact with their environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce semantic action flow as a core intermediate representation capturing the essential spatio-temporal manipulator-object interactions, invariant to superficial visual differences. We present ViSA-Flow, a framework that learns this representation self-supervised from unlabeled large-scale video data. First, a generative model is pre-trained on semantic action flows automatically extracted from large-scale human-object interaction video data, learning a robust prior over manipulation structure. Second, this prior is efficiently adapted to a target robot by fine-tuning on a small set of robot demonstrations processed through the same semantic abstraction pipeline. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world tasks that ViSA-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-data regimes, outperforming prior methods by effectively transferring knowledge from human video observation to robotic execution.

We also address tasks that must be performed by a coalition of robots in a coordinated manner. Given these features, we introduce a new class of heterogeneous MRTA problems which we analyze theoretically and optimally formulate as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program. We then contribute a heuristic algorithm to compute approximate solutions and integrate it into a mission planning and execution architecture capable of reacting to unexpected events by repairing or recomputing plans online. Our experimental results show the relevance of our newly formulated problem in a realistic use case for inspection with aerial robots. We assess the performance of our heuristic solver in comparison with other variants and with exact optimal solutions in small-scale scenarios. In addition, we evaluate the ability of our replanning framework to repair plans online.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoptic, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 35 sequences, both indoors and outdoors.

However, they continue to experience crippling long-tail latency spikes whenever bursty request streams exceed the capacity of heterogeneous edge and cloud tiers. To address these long-tail latency issues, we present Latency-Aware, Predictive In-Memory Routing and Proactive Autoscaling (LA-IMR). This control layer integrates a closed-form, utilization-driven latency model with event-driven scheduling, replica autoscaling, and edge-to-cloud offloading to mitigate 99th-percentile (P99) delays. Our analytic model decomposes end-to-end latency into processing, network, and queuing components, expressing inference latency as an affine power-law function of instance utilization. Once calibrated, it produces two complementary functions that drive: (i) millisecond-scale routing decisions for traffic offloading, and (ii) capacity planning that jointly determines replica pool sizes. LA-IMR enacts these decisions through a quality-differentiated, multi-queue scheduler and a custom-metric Kubernetes autoscaler that scales replicas proactively -- before queues build up -- rather than reactively based on lagging CPU metrics. Across representative vision workloads (YOLOv5m and EfficientDet) and bursty arrival traces, LA-IMR reduces P99 latency by up to 20.7 percent compared to traditional latency-only autoscaling, laying a principled foundation for next-generation, tail-tolerant cloud-edge inference services.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, the variable quality of training data often constrains the performance of these models. On the other hand, offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at learning robust policy models from mixed-quality data. In this paper, we introduce Reinforced robot GPT (ReinboT), a novel end-to-end VLA model that integrates the RL principle of maximizing cumulative reward. ReinboT achieves a deeper understanding of the data quality distribution by predicting dense returns that capture the nuances of manipulation tasks. The dense return prediction capability enables the robot to generate more robust decision-making actions, oriented towards maximizing future benefits. Extensive experiments show that ReinboT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN mixed-quality dataset and exhibits superior few-shot learning and out-of-distribution generalization capabilities in real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-enhanced Decision-Making for Autonomous Mobile Robots in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11901v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of robots in shared environments -- such as warehouses, shopping centres, and hospitals -- demands a deep understanding of the underlying dynamics and human behaviours, including how, when, and where individuals engage in various activities and interactions. This knowledge goes beyond simple correlation studies and requires a more comprehensive causal analysis. By leveraging causal inference to model cause-and-effect relationships, we can better anticipate critical environmental factors and enable autonomous robots to plan and execute tasks more effectively. To this end, we propose a novel causality-based decision-making framework that reasons over a learned causal model to predict battery usage and human obstructions, understanding how these factors could influence robot task execution. Such reasoning framework assists the robot in deciding when and how to complete a given task. To achieve this, we developed also PeopleFlow, a new Gazebo-based simulator designed to model context-sensitive human-robot spatial interactions in shared workspaces. PeopleFlow features realistic human and robot trajectories influenced by contextual factors such as time, environment layout, and robot state, and can simulate a large number of agents. While the simulator is general-purpose, in this paper we focus on a warehouse-like environment as a case study, where we conduct an extensive evaluation benchmarking our causal approach against a non-causal baseline. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solutions, highlighting how causal reasoning enables autonomous robots to operate more efficiently and safely in dynamic environments shared with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Causa...</summary><p>Causal Discovery and Inference - Robot Autonomy - Human-Robot Spatial Interaction - Decision-Making</p></details> |

| **[Autonomous Robotic Pruning in Orchards and Vineyards: a Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07318v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manual pruning is labor intensive and represents up to 25% of annual labor costs in fruit production, notably in apple orchards and vineyards where operational challenges and cost constraints limit the adoption of large-scale machinery. In response, a growing body of research is investigating compact, flexible robotic platforms capable of precise pruning in varied terrains, particularly where traditional mechanization falls short. This paper reviews recent advances in autonomous robotic pruning for orchards and vineyards, addressing a critical need in precision agriculture. Our review examines literature published between 2014 and 2024, focusing on innovative contributions across key system components. Special attention is given to recent developments in machine vision, perception, plant skeletonization, and control strategies, areas that have experienced significant influence from advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The analysis situates these technological trends within broader agricultural challenges, including rising labor costs, a decline in the number of young farmers, and the diverse pruning requirements of different fruit species such as apple, grapevine, and cherry trees. By comparing various robotic architectures and methodologies, this survey not only highlights the progress made toward autonomous pruning but also identifies critical open challenges and future research directions. The findings underscore the potential of robotic systems to bridge the gap between manual and mechanized operations, paving the way for more efficient, sustainable, and precise agricultural practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stereo Hand-Object Reconstruction for Human-to-Robot Handover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07487v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jointly estimating hand and object shape facilitates the grasping task in human-to-robot handovers. However, relying on hand-crafted prior knowledge about the geometric structure of the object fails when generalising to unseen objects, and depth sensors fail to detect transparent objects such as drinking glasses. In this work, we propose a stereo-based method for hand-object reconstruction that combines single-view reconstructions probabilistically to form a coherent stereo reconstruction. We learn 3D shape priors from a large synthetic hand-object dataset to ensure that our method is generalisable, and use RGB inputs to better capture transparent objects. We show that our method reduces the object Chamfer distance compared to existing RGB based hand-object reconstruction methods on single view and stereo settings. We process the reconstructed hand-object shape with a projection-based outlier removal step and use the output to guide a human-to-robot handover pipeline with wide-baseline stereo RGB cameras. Our hand-object reconstruction enables a robot to successfully receive a diverse range of household objects from the human.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table.

It holds particular promise for soft robots, which are amenable to novel manufacturing techniques that can realize learned morphologies and actuators. Inspired by nature and recent novel robot designs, we propose to go a step further and explore the novel reconfigurable robots, defined as robots that can change their morphology within their lifetime. We formalize control of reconfigurable soft robots as a high-dimensional reinforcement learning (RL) problem. We unify morphology change, locomotion, and environment interaction in the same action space, and introduce an appropriate, coarse-to-fine curriculum that enables us to discover policies that accomplish fine-grained control of the resulting robots. We also introduce DittoGym, a comprehensive RL benchmark for reconfigurable soft robots that require fine-grained morphology changes to accomplish the tasks. Finally, we evaluate our proposed coarse-to-fine algorithm on DittoGym and demonstrate robots that learn to change their morphology several times within a sequence, uniquely enabled by our RL algorithm.

Our system enables users to visualize robot perception outputs such as object detection and segmentation results using a MR device. Therefore, users can inspect failures of perception models using the system on real robots. Moreover, iTeach facilitates real-time, informed data collection and annotation, where users can use hand gesture, eye gaze and voice commands to annotate images collected from robots. The annotated images can be used to fine-tune perception models to improve their accuracy and adaptability. The system continually improves perception models by collecting annotations of failed examples from users. When applied to object detection and unseen object instance segmentation (UOIS) tasks, iTeach demonstrates encouraging results in improving pre-trained vision models for these two tasks. These results highlight the potential of MR to make robotic perception systems more capable and adaptive in real-world environments.

| **[Being-0: A Humanoid Robotic Agent with Vision-Language Models and Modular Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12533v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building autonomous robotic agents capable of achieving human-level performance in real-world embodied tasks is an ultimate goal in humanoid robot research. Recent advances have made significant progress in high-level cognition with Foundation Models (FMs) and low-level skill development for humanoid robots. However, directly combining these components often results in poor robustness and efficiency due to compounding errors in long-horizon tasks and the varied latency of different modules. We introduce Being-0, a hierarchical agent framework that integrates an FM with a modular skill library. The FM handles high-level cognitive tasks such as instruction understanding, task planning, and reasoning, while the skill library provides stable locomotion and dexterous manipulation for low-level control. To bridge the gap between these levels, we propose a novel Connector module, powered by a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). The Connector enhances the FM's embodied capabilities by translating language-based plans into actionable skill commands and dynamically coordinating locomotion and manipulation to improve task success. With all components, except the FM, deployable on low-cost onboard computation devices, Being-0 achieves efficient, real-time performance on a full-sized humanoid robot equipped with dexterous hands and active vision. Extensive experiments in large indoor environments demonstrate Being-0's effectiveness in solving complex, long-horizon tasks that require challenging navigation and manipulation subtasks.

Designed in collaboration with AstraZeneca, the challenge invited academic teams to develop autonomous robotic systems capable of navigating human-populated lab spaces and performing complex manipulation tasks, such as loading items into industrial dishwashers. This paper presents an overview of the challenge setup, its industrial motivation, and the four distinct approaches proposed by the participating teams. We summarize lessons learned from this edition and propose improvements in design to enable a more effective second iteration to take place in 2025. The initiative bridges an important gap in effective academia-industry collaboration within the domain of autonomous mobile manipulation systems by promoting the development and deployment of applied robotic solutions in real-world laboratory contexts.</p></details> |  |

ML models, especially artificial neural networks (ANNs), can provide advanced decision-making and control capabilities by learning from data. However, they often function as black boxes, making it challenging to interpret them. This is especially a problem in safety-critical control applications. To generate realistic CFEs, we parameterize the LiDAR space with simple shapes such as circles and rectangles, whose parameters are chosen by a genetic algorithm, and the configurations are transformed into LiDAR data by raycasting. Our model-agnostic approach generates CFEs in the form of synthetic LiDAR data that resembles a base LiDAR state but is modified to produce a pre-defined ML model control output based on a query from the user. We demonstrate our method on a mobile robot, the TurtleBot3, controlled using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in real-world and simulated scenarios. Our method generates logical and realistic CFEs, which helps to interpret the DRL agent's decision making. This paper contributes towards advancing explainable AI in mobile robotics, and our method could be a tool for understanding, debugging, and improving ML-based autonomous control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2025 European Control Conference (ECC)</p></details> |
| **[FACET: Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking for Legged Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06883v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in legged robot control, enabling locomotion across diverse terrains and complex loco-manipulation capabilities. However, the commonly used position or velocity tracking-based objectives are agnostic to forces experienced by the robot, leading to stiff and potentially dangerous behaviors and poor control during forceful interactions. To address this limitation, we present \emph{Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking} (FACET). Inspired by impedance control, we use RL to train a control policy to imitate a virtual mass-spring-damper system, allowing fine-grained control under external forces by manipulating the virtual spring. In simulation, we demonstrate that our quadruped robot achieves improved robustness to large impulses (up to 200 Ns) and exhibits controllable compliance, achieving an 80% reduction in collision impulse. The policy is deployed to a physical robot to showcase both compliance and the ability to engage with large forces by kinesthetic control and pulling payloads up to 2/3 of its weight. Further extension to a legged loco-manipulator and a humanoid shows the applicability of our method to more complex settings to enable whole-body compliance control.

| **[Efficient Robotic Policy Learning via Latent Space Backward Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06861v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current robotic planning methods often rely on predicting multi-frame images with full pixel details. While this fine-grained approach can serve as a generic world model, it introduces two significant challenges for downstream policy learning: substantial computational costs that hinder real-time deployment, and accumulated inaccuracies that can mislead action extraction. Planning with coarse-grained subgoals partially alleviates efficiency issues. However, their forward planning schemes can still result in off-task predictions due to accumulation errors, leading to misalignment with long-term goals. This raises a critical question: Can robotic planning be both efficient and accurate enough for real-time control in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks? To address this, we propose a Latent Space Backward Planning scheme (LBP), which begins by grounding the task into final latent goals, followed by recursively predicting intermediate subgoals closer to the current state. The grounded final goal enables backward subgoal planning to always remain aware of task completion, facilitating on-task prediction along the entire planning horizon. The subgoal-conditioned policy incorporates a learnable token to summarize the subgoal sequences and determines how each subgoal guides action extraction. Through extensive simulation and real-robot long-horizon experiments, we show that LBP outperforms existing fine-grained and forward planning methods, achieving SOTA performance.

The proposed framework integrates a robust state estimator capable of accurately reconstructing neighboring agents' velocity vectors and orientations under varying dynamic conditions, with a decentralized formation tracking controller that leverages Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee collision avoidance and inter-agent safety. We present a closed-form control law that ensures both stability and string stability, effectively attenuating disturbances propagating from leader to followers. The theoretical foundations of the estimator and controller are established using Lyapunov stability analysis, which confirms global asymptotic stability under constant velocities and global uniformly ultimate boundedness under time-varying conditions. Extensive numerical simulations and realistic Gazebo-based experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and practical applicability of the proposed method, demonstrating precise formation tracking, stringent safety maintenance, and disturbance resilience without relying on inter-robot communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

However, established MARL platforms (e.g., SMAC and MPE) lack robotics relevance and hardware deployment, leaving multi-robot learning researchers to develop bespoke environments and hardware testbeds dedicated to the development and evaluation of their individual contributions. The Multi-Agent RL Benchmark and Learning Environment for the Robotarium (MARBLER) is an exciting recent step in providing a standardized robotics-relevant platform for MARL, by bridging the Robotarium testbed with existing MARL software infrastructure. However, MARBLER lacks support for parallelization and GPU/TPU execution, making the platform prohibitively slow compared to modern MARL environments and hindering adoption. We contribute JaxRobotarium, a Jax-powered end-to-end simulation, learning, deployment, and benchmarking platform for the Robotarium. JaxRobotarium enables rapid training and deployment of multi-robot reinforcement learning (MRRL) policies with realistic robot dynamics and safety constraints, supporting both parallelization and hardware acceleration. Our generalizable learning interface provides an easy-to-use integration with SOTA MARL libraries (e.g., JaxMARL). In addition, JaxRobotarium includes eight standardized coordination scenarios, including four novel scenarios that bring established MARL benchmark tasks (e.g., RWARE and Level-Based Foraging) to a realistic robotics setting. We demonstrate that JaxRobotarium retains high simulation fidelity while achieving dramatic speedups over baseline (20x in training and 150x in simulation), and provides an open-access sim-to-real evaluation pipeline through the Robotarium testbed, accelerating and democratizing access to multi-robot learning research and evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[HAMSTER: Hierarchical Action Models For Open-World Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05485v4)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

However, network intrusion to IoRT can lead to data leakage, service interruption in IoRT and even physical damage by controlling robots or vehicles. This paper proposes a Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning Network Intrusion Detection framework (CFedSSL-NID) for IoRT intrusion detection and defense, to address the practical scenario of IoRT where robots don't possess labeled data locally and the requirement for data privacy preserving. CFedSSL-NID integrates randomly weak and strong augmentation, latent contrastive learning, and EMA update to integrate supervised signals, thereby enhancing performance and robustness on robots' local unlabeled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CFedSSL-NID outperforms existing federated semi-supervised and fully supervised methods on benchmark dataset and has lower resource requirements.</p></details> |  |

Although prior work has demonstrated skateboarding for quadrupeds that are already positioned on the board, the initial mounting phase still poses a significant challenge. A goal-oriented methodology was adopted, beginning with the terminal phases of the task and progressively increasing the complexity of the problem definition to approximate the desired objective. The learning process was initiated with the skateboard rigidly fixed within the global coordinate frame and the robot positioned directly above it. Through gradual relaxation of these initial conditions, the learned policy demonstrated robustness to variations in skateboard position and orientation, ultimately exhibiting a successful transfer to scenarios involving a mobile skateboard.

A key bottleneck is that collecting robotic data often requires expertise or specialized hardware, limiting accessibility and scalability. We posit that natural language offers an intuitive and accessible interface for robot learning. To this end, we study two aspects: (1) enabling non-experts to collect robotic data through natural language supervision (e.g., "move the arm to the right") and (2) training robot policies directly from this supervision. Specifically, we introduce a data collection framework that collects robot demonstrations based on natural language supervision and further augments these demonstrations. We then present CLIP-RT, a new vision-language-action (VLA) model that learns language-conditioned visuomotor policies from this supervision. CLIP-RT adapts the pretrained CLIP model and learns to predict language-based motion primitives via contrastive imitation learning. We train CLIP-RT on the Open X-Embodiment dataset and finetune it on in-domain data collected by our framework. In real-world evaluations, CLIP-RT demonstrates strong capabilities in learning novel manipulation skills, outperforming OpenVLA (7B parameters) by 24% in average success rates, while using 7x fewer parameters (1B). We further assess CLIP-RT's capabilities in few-shot generalization and collaborative scenarios involving large pretrained models or humans. In simulated environments, CLIP-RT also yields strong performance, achieving a 93.1% average success rate on the LIBERO benchmark with an inference throughput of 163 Hz.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RSS 2025.

Inspired by these developments, researchers have begun exploring the use of LLMs as decentralized decision-makers for multi-robot formation control. However, prior studies reveal that directly applying LLMs to such tasks often leads to unstable and inconsistent behaviors, where robots may collapse to the centroid of their positions or diverge entirely due to hallucinated reasoning, logical inconsistencies, and limited coordination awareness. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that integrates LLMs with an influence-based plan consensus protocol. In this framework, each robot independently generates a local plan toward the desired formation using its own LLM. The robots then iteratively refine their plans through a decentralized consensus protocol that accounts for their influence on neighboring robots. This process drives the system toward a coherent and stable flocking formation in a fully decentralized manner. We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulations involving both state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs (e.g., o3-mini, Claude 3.5) and open-source models (e.g., Llama3.1-405b, Qwen-Max, DeepSeek-R1). The results show notable improvements in stability, convergence, and adaptability over previous LLM-based methods. We further validate our framework on a physical team of Crazyflie drones, demonstrating its practical viability and effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems.</p></details> |  |

This becomes particularly challenging in perception-degraded subterranean conditions under harsh environmental factors, including darkness, dust, and geometrically self-similar structures. This paper details CompSLAM, a highly resilient and hierarchical multi-modal localization and mapping framework designed to address these challenges. Its flexible architecture achieves resilience through redundancy by leveraging the complementary nature of pose estimates derived from diverse sensor modalities. Developed during the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, CompSLAM was successfully deployed on all aerial, legged, and wheeled robots of Team Cerberus during their competition-winning final run. Furthermore, it has proven to be a reliable odometry and mapping solution in various subsequent projects, with extensions enabling multi-robot map sharing for marsupial robotic deployments and collaborative mapping. This paper also introduces a comprehensive dataset acquired by a manually teleoperated quadrupedal robot, covering a significant portion of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge finals course. This dataset evaluates CompSLAM's robustness to sensor degradations as the robot traverses 740 meters in an environment characterized by highly variable geometries and demanding lighting conditions.

Researchers have explored how Large Language Models (LLMs) could enable non-expert users to specify reward functions more easily. However, LLMs struggle to balance the importance of different features, generalize poorly to out-of-distribution robotic tasks, and cannot represent the problem properly with only text-based descriptions. To address these challenges, we propose ELEMENTAL (intEractive LEarning froM dEmoNstraTion And Language), a novel framework that combines natural language guidance with visual user demonstrations to align robot behavior with user intentions better. By incorporating visual inputs, ELEMENTAL overcomes the limitations of text-only task specifications, while leveraging inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to balance feature weights and match the demonstrated behaviors optimally. ELEMENTAL also introduces an iterative feedback-loop through self-reflection to improve feature, reward, and policy learning. Our experiment results demonstrate that ELEMENTAL outperforms prior work by 42.3% on task success, and achieves 41.3% better generalization in out-of-distribution tasks, highlighting its robustness in LfD.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Vision-language-action (VLA) models, in particular, have emerged as a promising approach for visuomotor control by leveraging large-scale vision-language data and robot demonstrations.

To address this gap, we present VLATest, a fuzzing framework designed to generate robotic manipulation scenes for testing VLA models. Based on VLATest, we conducted an empirical study to assess the performance of seven representative VLA models. Our study results revealed that current VLA models lack the robustness necessary for practical deployment. Additionally, we investigated the impact of various factors, including the number of confounding objects, lighting conditions, camera poses, unseen objects, and task instruction mutations, on the VLA model's performance. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing VLA models, emphasizing the need for further research to develop reliable and trustworthy VLA applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in FSE '25 (Proceedings of ACM Software Engineering, Vol. 2, Issue FSE, Article FSE073), 24 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

While human responses to these queries make it possible to learn policies aligned with human preferences, PbRL suffers from low query efficiency, as policy bias limits trajectory diversity and reduces the number of discriminable queries available for learning preferences. This paper identifies preference discriminability, which quantifies how easily a human can judge which trajectory is closer to their ideal behavior, as a key metric for improving query efficiency. To address this, we move beyond comparisons within a single policy and instead generate queries by comparing trajectories from multiple policies, as training them from scratch promotes diversity without policy bias. We propose Discriminability-Aware Policy-to-Policy Preference-Based Efficient Reinforcement Learning (DAPPER), which integrates preference discriminability with trajectory diversification achieved by multiple policies. DAPPER trains new policies from scratch after each reward update and employs a discriminator that learns to estimate preference discriminability, enabling the prioritized sampling of more discriminable queries. During training, it jointly maximizes the preference reward and preference discriminability score, encouraging the discovery of highly rewarding and easily distinguishable policies. Experiments in simulated and real-world legged robot environments demonstrate that DAPPER outperforms previous methods in query efficiency, particularly under challenging preference discriminability conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning-based adaption of robotic friction models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16688v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, wherein artificial intelligence and the automation of machines occupy a central role, the deployment of robots is indispensable. However, the manufacturing process using robots, especially in collaboration with humans, is highly intricate. In particular, modeling the friction torque in robotic joints is a longstanding problem due to the lack of a good mathematical description. This motivates the usage of data-driven methods in recent works. However, model-based and data-driven models often exhibit limitations in their ability to generalize beyond the specific dynamics they were trained on, as we demonstrate in this paper. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach based on residual learning, which aims to adapt an existing friction model to new dynamics using as little data as possible. We validate our approach by training a base neural network on a symmetric friction data set to learn an accurate relation between the velocity and the friction torque. Subsequently, to adapt to more complex asymmetric settings, we train a second network on a small dataset, focusing on predicting the residual of the initial network's output. By combining the output of both networks in a suitable manner, our proposed estimator outperforms the conventional model-based approach, an extended LuGre model, and the base neural network significantly. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on trajectories involving external loads and still observe a substantial improvement, approximately 60-70%, over the conventional approach. Our method does not rely on data with external load during training, eliminating the need for external torque sensors. This demonstrates the generalization capability of our approach, even with a small amount of data--less than a minute--enabling adaptation to diverse scenarios based on prior knowledge about friction in different settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter-Free Segmentation of Robot Movements with Cross-Correlation Using Different Similarity Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06100v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Often, robots are asked to execute primitive movements, whether as a single action or in a series of actions representing a larger, more complex task. These movements can be learned in many ways, but a common one is from demonstrations presented to the robot by a teacher. However, these demonstrations are not always simple movements themselves, and complex demonstrations must be broken down, or segmented, into primitive movements. In this work, we present a parameter-free approach to segmentation using techniques inspired by autocorrelation and cross-correlation from signal processing. In cross-correlation, a representative signal is found in some larger, more complex signal by correlating the representative signal with the larger signal. This same idea can be applied to segmenting robot motion and demonstrations, provided with a representative motion primitive. This results in a fast and accurate segmentation, which does not take any parameters. One of the main contributions of this paper is the modification of the cross-correlation process by employing similarity metrics that can capture features specific to robot movements. To validate our framework, we conduct several experiments of complex tasks both in simulation and in real-world. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our segmentation framework by comparing various similarity metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Robot Learning Using Multi-Coordinate Elastic Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06092v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To learn manipulation skills, robots need to understand the features of those skills. An easy way for robots to learn is through Learning from Demonstration (LfD), where the robot learns a skill from an expert demonstrator. While the main features of a skill might be captured in one differential coordinate (i.e., Cartesian), they could have meaning in other coordinates. For example, an important feature of a skill may be its shape or velocity profile, which are difficult to discover in Cartesian differential coordinate. In this work, we present a method which enables robots to learn skills from human demonstrations via encoding these skills into various differential coordinates, then determines the importance of each coordinate to reproduce the skill. We also introduce a modified form of Elastic Maps that includes multiple differential coordinates, combining statistical modeling of skills in these differential coordinate spaces. Elastic Maps, which are flexible and fast to compute, allow for the incorporation of several different types of constraints and the use of any number of demonstrations. Additionally, we propose methods for auto-tuning several parameters associated with the modified Elastic Map formulation. We validate our approach in several simulated experiments and a real-world writing task with a UR5e manipulator arm.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures.

| **[3D Hand-Eye Calibration for Collaborative Robot Arm: Look at Robot Base Once](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21619v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand-eye calibration is a common problem in the field of collaborative robotics, involving the determination of the transformation matrix between the visual sensor and the robot flange to enable vision-based robotic tasks. However, this process typically requires multiple movements of the robot arm and an external calibration object, making it both time-consuming and inconvenient, especially in scenarios where frequent recalibration is necessary. In this work, we extend our previous method which eliminates the need for external calibration objects such as a chessboard. We propose a generic dataset generation approach for point cloud registration, focusing on aligning the robot base point cloud with the scanned data. Furthermore, a more detailed simulation study is conducted involving several different collaborative robot arms, followed by real-world experiments in an industrial setting. Our improved method is simulated and evaluated using a total of 14 robotic arms from 9 different brands, including KUKA, Universal Robots, UFACTORY, and Franka Emika, all of which are widely used in the field of collaborative robotics. Physical experiments demonstrate that our extended approach achieves performance comparable to existing commercial hand-eye calibration solutions, while completing the entire calibration procedure in just a few seconds. In addition, we provide a user-friendly hand-eye calibration solution, with the code publicly available at github.com/leihui6/LRBO.</p></details> | updated |
| **[Adaptive Robot Localization with Ultra-wideband Novelty Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05903v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology has shown remarkable potential as a low-cost general solution for robot localization. However, limitations of the UWB signal for precise positioning arise from the disturbances caused by the environment itself, due to reflectance, multi-path effect, and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions. This problem is emphasized in cluttered indoor spaces where service robotic platforms usually operate. Both model-based and learning-based methods are currently under investigation to precisely predict the UWB error patterns. Despite the great capability in approximating strong non-linearity, learning-based methods often do not consider environmental factors and require data collection and re-training for unseen data distributions, making them not practically feasible on a large scale. The goal of this research is to develop a robust and adaptive UWB localization method for indoor confined spaces. A novelty detection technique is used to recognize outlier conditions from nominal UWB range data with a semi-supervised autoencoder. Then, the obtained novelty scores are combined with an Extended Kalman filter, leveraging a dynamic estimation of covariance and bias error for each range measurement received from the UWB anchors. The resulting solution is a compact, flexible, and robust system which enables the localization system to adapt the trustworthiness of UWB data spatially and temporally in the environment. The extensive experimentation conducted with a real robot in a wide range of testing scenarios demonstrates the advantages and benefits of the proposed solution in indoor cluttered spaces presenting NLoS conditions, reaching an average improvement of almost 60% and greater than 25cm of absolute positioning error.</p></details> |  |

We employ a motion-style reward based on a relaxed logarithmic barrier function as a soft constraint, to bias the learning process toward the desired motion style, such as gait, foot clearance, joint position, or body height. The predefined gait cycle is encoded in a flexible manner, facilitating gait adjustments throughout the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KAIST HOUND, a 45 kg robotic system, can achieve biped, tripod, and quadruped locomotion using the proposed framework; quadrupedal capabilities include traversing uneven terrain, galloping at 4.67 m/s, and overcoming obstacles up to 58 cm (67 cm for HOUND2); bipedal capabilities include running at 3.6 m/s, carrying a 7.5 kg object, and ascending stairs-all performed without exteroceptive input.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, Videos at https://youtu.be/JV2_HfTlOKI, IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

Although robotic arms are currently used primarily for functional tasks, there is considerable potential to explore ways to enhance users' body language capabilities during social interactions. This paper introduces an Augmented Body Communicator system that integrates robotic arms and a large language model. Through the incorporation of kinetic memory, disabled users and their supporters can collaboratively design actions for the robot arm. The LLM system then provides suggestions on the most suitable action based on contextual cues during interactions. The system underwent thorough user testing with six participants who have conditions affecting upper limb mobility. Results indicate that the system improves users' ability to express themselves. Based on our findings, we offer recommendations for developing robotic arms that support disabled individuals with body language capabilities and functional tasks.</p></details> |  |

How Do People Feel about Robots that Leverage Profanity?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05831v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Profanity is nearly as old as language itself, and cursing has become particularly ubiquitous within the last century. At the same time, robots in personal and service applications are often overly polite, even though past work demonstrates the potential benefits of robot norm-breaking. Thus, we became curious about robots using curse words in error scenarios as a means for improving social perceptions by human users. We investigated this idea using three phases of exploratory work: an online video-based study (N = 76) with a student pool, an online video-based study (N = 98) in the general U.S. population, and an in-person proof-of-concept deployment (N = 52) in a campus space, each of which included the following conditions: no-speech, non-expletive error response, and expletive error response. A surprising result in the outcomes for all three studies was that although verbal acknowledgment of an error was typically beneficial (as expected based on prior work), few significant differences appeared between the non-expletive and expletive error acknowledgment conditions (counter to our expectations). Within the cultural context of our work, the U.S., it seems that many users would likely not mind if robots curse, and may even find it relatable and humorous. This work signals a promising and mischievous design space that challenges typical robot character design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for the 2025 IEEE RO-MAN Conference</p></details> |

In such scenarios, alternative sensing modalities are needed to provide timely and robust feedback. To this end, we explore the use of audio and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to detect underlying anomalies in autonomous mobile robots, such as collisions and internal mechanical faults. Furthermore, to address the challenge of limited labeled anomaly data, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on Mahalanobis Support Vector Data Description (M-SVDD). In contrast to conventional SVDD methods that rely on Euclidean distance and assume isotropic feature distributions, our approach employs the Mahalanobis distance to adaptively scale feature dimensions and capture inter-feature correlations, enabling more expressive decision boundaries. In addition, a reconstruction-based auxiliary branch is introduced to preserve feature diversity and prevent representation collapse, further enhancing the robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on a collected mobile robot dataset and four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as shown in the video https://youtu.be/yh1tn6DDD4A.

Their kinematic redundancy enhances reachability and manipulability, enabling them to navigate complex, cluttered environments and perform a wide range of tasks. However, this redundancy also presents significant control challenges, particularly in coordinating the movements of the robot's macro-micro structure (torso and arms). Therefore, we propose various human-robot collaborative (HRC) methods for coordinating the torso and arm of remotely controlled mobile humanoid robots, aiming to balance autonomy and human input to enhance system efficiency and task execution. The proposed methods include human-initiated approaches, where users manually control torso movements, and robot-initiated approaches, which autonomously coordinate torso and arm based on factors such as reachability, task goal, or inferred human intent. We conducted a user study with N=17 participants to compare the proposed approaches in terms of task performance, manipulability, and energy efficiency, and analyzed which methods were preferred by participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2025).

To evaluate generalizability comparatively, we conducted experiments with models from both GPT and DeepSeek.

In this work, we focus on the axis of embodiment and investigate embodiment scaling laws$\unicode{x2013}$the hypothesis that increasing the number of training embodiments improves generalization to unseen ones. Using robot locomotion as a test bed, we procedurally generate a dataset of $\sim$1,000 varied embodiments, spanning humanoids, quadrupeds, and hexapods, and train generalist policies capable of handling diverse observation and action spaces on random subsets. We find that increasing the number of training embodiments improves generalization to unseen ones, and scaling embodiments is more effective in enabling embodiment-level generalization than scaling data on small, fixed sets of embodiments. Notably, our best policy, trained on the full dataset, zero-shot transfers to novel embodiments in the real world, such as Unitree Go2 and H1. These results represent a step toward general embodied intelligence, with potential relevance to adaptive control for configurable robots, co-design of morphology and control, and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages.

Recently, self-supervised learning methods have emerged to tackle motion planning problems without requiring expensive expert demonstrations. They solve the Eikonal equation for training neural networks and lead to efficient solutions. However, these methods struggle in complex environments because they fail to maintain key properties of the Eikonal equation, such as optimal value functions and geodesic distances. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised temporal difference metric learning approach that solves the Eikonal equation more accurately and enhances performance in solving complex and unseen planning tasks. Our method enforces Bellman's principle of optimality over finite regions, using temporal difference learning to avoid spurious local minima while incorporating metric learning to preserve the Eikonal equation's essential geodesic properties. We demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing self-supervised learning methods in handling complex environments and generalizing to unseen environments, with robot configurations ranging from 2 to 12 degrees of freedom (DOF).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

By leveraging design principles of quasi-passive walking robots at any scale, stable locomotion and steering can be achieved with simple mechanisms and open-loop control. Here, we present the design and control of "Zippy", the smallest self-contained bipedal walking robot at only 3.6 cm tall. Zippy has rounded feet, a single motor without feedback control, and is capable of turning, skipping, and ascending steps. At its fastest pace, the robot achieves a forward walking speed of 25 cm/s, which is 10 leg lengths per second, the fastest biped robot of any size by that metric.

While imitation learning shows promise for complex manipulation tasks, traditional approaches struggle with soft systems due to demonstration collection challenges and ineffective state representations. We present KineSoft, a framework enabling direct kinesthetic teaching of soft robotic hands by leveraging their natural compliance as a skill teaching advantage rather than only as a control challenge. KineSoft makes two key contributions: (1) an internal strain sensing array providing occlusion-free proprioceptive shape estimation, and (2) a shape-based imitation learning framework that uses proprioceptive feedback with a low-level shape-conditioned controller to ground diffusion-based policies. This enables human demonstrators to physically guide the robot while the system learns to associate proprioceptive patterns with successful manipulation strategies. We validate KineSoft through physical experiments, demonstrating superior shape estimation accuracy compared to baseline methods, precise shape-trajectory tracking, and higher task success rates compared to baseline imitation learning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[An End-to-End Framework for Optimizing Foot Trajectory and Force in Dry Adhesion Legged Wall-Climbing Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19448v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foot trajectory planning for dry adhesion legged climbing robots presents challenges, as the phases of foot detachment, swing, and adhesion significantly influence the adhesion and detachment forces essential for stable climbing. To tackle this, an end-to-end foot trajectory and force optimization framework (FTFOF) is proposed, which optimizes foot adhesion and detachment forces through trajectory adjustments. This framework accepts general foot trajectory constraints and user-defined parameters as input, ultimately producing an optimal single foot trajectory. It integrates three-segment $C^2$ continuous Bezier curves, tailored to various foot structures, enabling the generation of effective climbing trajectories. A dilate-based GRU predictive model establishes the relationship between foot trajectories and the corresponding foot forces. Multi-objective optimization algorithms, combined with a redundancy hierarchical strategy, identify the most suitable foot trajectory for specific tasks, thereby ensuring optimal performance across detachment force, adhesion force and vibration amplitude. Experimental validation on the quadruped climbing robot MST-M3F showed that, compared to commonly used trajectories in existing legged climbing robots, the proposed framework achieved reductions in maximum detachment force by 28 \%, vibration amplitude by 82 \%, which ensures the stable climbing of dry adhesion legged climbing robots.</p></details> |  |

To study this problem fundamentally, we ground ourselves in a model-based control setting enabled by mathematically precise dynamics of a soft robot prototype. Poised to integrate, rather than reject, inherent mechanical nonlinearities for embodied compliance, we first separate the original robot dynamics into separate subdynamics -- aided by a perturbing time-scale separation parameter. Second, we prescribe a set of stabilizing nonlinear backstepping controllers for regulating the resulting subsystems' strain dynamics. Third, we study the interconnected singularly perturbed system by analyzing and establishing its stability. Fourth, our theories are backed up by fast numerical results on a single arm of the Octopus robot arm. We demonstrate strain regulation to equilibrium, in a significantly reduced time, of the whole-body reduced-order dynamics of an infinite degrees-of-freedom soft robot. This paper communicates our thinking within the backdrop of embodied intelligence: it informs our conceptualization, formulation, computational setup, and yields improved control performance for infinite degrees-of-freedom soft robots.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, a virtual cotton farm was designed and developed as a Robot Operating System (ROS 1) package to deploy the robotic cotton picker in the Gazebo environment for simulating autonomous field navigation. The navigation was assisted by the map coordinates and an RGB-depth camera, while the ROS navigation algorithm utilized a trained YOLOv8n-seg model for instance segmentation. The model achieved a desired mean Average Precision (mAP) of 85.2%, a recall of 88.9%, and a precision of 93.0% for scene segmentation. The developed ROS navigation packages enabled our robotic cotton-picking system to autonomously navigate through the cotton field using map-based and GPS-based approaches, visually aided by a deep learning-based perception system. The GPS-based navigation approach achieved a 100% completion rate (CR) with a threshold of 5 x 10^-6 degrees, while the map-based navigation approach attained a 96.7% CR with a threshold of 0.25 m.

Predicting object affordances from visual perception is formulated differently for tasks such as grasping detection, affordance classification, affordance segmentation, and hand-object interaction synthesis. In this work, we highlight the reproducibility issue in these redefinitions, making comparative benchmarks unfair and unreliable. To address this problem, we propose a unified formulation for visual affordance prediction, provide a comprehensive and systematic review of previous works highlighting strengths and limitations of methods and datasets, and analyse what challenges reproducibility. To favour transparency, we introduce the Affordance Sheet, a document to detail the proposed solution, the datasets, and the validation. As the physical properties of an object influence the interaction with the robot, we present a generic framework that links visual affordance prediction to the physical world. Using the weight of an object as an example for this framework, we discuss how estimating object mass can affect the affordance prediction. Our approach bridges the gap between affordance perception and robot actuation, and accounts for the complete information about objects of interest and how the robot interacts with them to accomplish its task.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 12 figures, 10 tables.

Nevertheless, real-time, open-vocabulary semantic understanding of large-scale unknown environments is still an open problem. In this paper we present FindAnything, an open-world mapping and exploration framework that incorporates vision-language information into dense volumetric submaps. Thanks to the use of vision-language features, FindAnything bridges the gap between pure geometric and open-vocabulary semantic information for a higher level of understanding while allowing to explore any environment without the help of any external source of ground-truth pose information. We represent the environment as a series of volumetric occupancy submaps, resulting in a robust and accurate map representation that deforms upon pose updates when the underlying SLAM system corrects its drift, allowing for a locally consistent representation between submaps. Pixel-wise vision-language features are aggregated from efficient SAM (eSAM)-generated segments, which are in turn integrated into object-centric volumetric submaps, providing a mapping from open-vocabulary queries to 3D geometry that is scalable also in terms of memory usage. The open-vocabulary map representation of FindAnything achieves state-of-the-art semantic accuracy in closed-set evaluations on the Replica dataset. This level of scene understanding allows a robot to explore environments based on objects or areas of interest selected via natural language queries. Our system is the first of its kind to be deployed on resource-constrained devices, such as MAVs, leveraging vision-language information for real-world robotic tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[CLAM: Continuous Latent Action Models for Robot Learning from Unlabeled Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04999v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robot policies using imitation learning requires collecting large amounts of costly action-labeled expert demonstrations, which fundamentally limits the scale of training data. A promising approach to address this bottleneck is to harness the abundance of unlabeled observations-e.g., from video demonstrations-to learn latent action labels in an unsupervised way. However, we find that existing methods struggle when applied to complex robot tasks requiring fine-grained motions. We design continuous latent action models (CLAM) which incorporate two key ingredients we find necessary for learning to solve complex continuous control tasks from unlabeled observation data: (a) using continuous latent action labels instead of discrete representations, and (b) jointly training an action decoder to ensure that the latent action space can be easily grounded to real actions with relatively few labeled examples. Importantly, the labeled examples can be collected from non-optimal play data, enabling CLAM to learn performant policies without access to any action-labeled expert data. We demonstrate on continuous control benchmarks in DMControl (locomotion) and MetaWorld (manipulation), as well as on a real WidowX robot arm that CLAM significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, remarkably with a 2-3x improvement in task success rate compared to the best baseline.

| **[Real-Time Privacy Preservation for Robot Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05519v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many robots (e.g., iRobot's Roomba) operate based on visual observations from live video streams, and such observations may inadvertently include privacy-sensitive objects, such as personal identifiers. Existing approaches for preserving privacy rely on deep learning models, differential privacy, or cryptography. They lack guarantees for the complete concealment of all sensitive objects. Guaranteeing concealment requires post-processing techniques and thus is inadequate for real-time video streams. We develop a method for privacy-constrained video streaming, PCVS, that conceals sensitive objects within real-time video streams. PCVS takes a logical specification constraining the existence of privacy-sensitive objects, e.g., never show faces when a person exists. It uses a detection model to evaluate the existence of these objects in each incoming frame. Then, it blurs out a subset of objects such that the existence of the remaining objects satisfies the specification. We then propose a conformal prediction approach to (i) establish a theoretical lower bound on the probability of the existence of these objects in a sequence of frames satisfying the specification and (ii) update the bound with the arrival of each subsequent frame. Quantitative evaluations show that PCVS achieves over 95 percent specification satisfaction rate in multiple datasets, significantly outperforming other methods. The satisfaction rate is consistently above the theoretical bounds across all datasets, indicating that the established bounds hold. Additionally, we deploy PCVS on robots in real-time operation and show that the robots operate normally without being compromised when PCVS conceals objects.</p></details> |  |

However, as a primary task of coverage path planning (CPP) for troweling, delimitating area of interest (AOI) in complex scenes is still challenging, especially for swing-arm robots with more complex working modes. Thus, this research proposes an algorithm to delimitate AOI for swing-arm troweling robot (SatAOI algorithm). By analyzing characteristics of the robot and obstacle maps, mathematical models and collision principles are established. On this basis, SatAOI algorithm achieves AOI delimitation by global search and collision detection. Experiments on different obstacle maps indicate that AOI can be effectively delimitated in scenes under different complexity, and the algorithm can fully consider the connectivity of obstacle maps. This research serves as a foundation for CPP algorithm and full process simulation of swing-arm troweling robots.</p></details> |  |

Key contributions include: 1) analysis of RSHPN meta-model properties; 2) decomposition of RSHPN analysis into analysis of individual Petri nets, thus the reduction of state space explosion; and 3) transfer of RSHPN meta-model properties onto the produced models, hence elimination of the need for full re-analysis of the RSHPN model when creating new robotic systems. Only task-dependent parts of the model need to be analysed. This approach streamlines the analysis thus reducing the design time. Moreover, it produces a specification which is a solid foundation for the implementation of the system. The obtained results highlight the potential of Petri nets as a valuable formal framework for analysing robotic system properties.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Efficient Sensorimotor Learning for Open-world Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06136v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This dissertation considers Open-world Robot Manipulation, a manipulation problem where a robot must generalize or quickly adapt to new objects, scenes, or tasks for which it has not been pre-programmed or pre-trained. This dissertation tackles the problem using a methodology of efficient sensorimotor learning. The key to enabling efficient sensorimotor learning lies in leveraging regular patterns that exist in limited amounts of demonstration data. These patterns, referred to as ``regularity,'' enable the data-efficient learning of generalizable manipulation skills. This dissertation offers a new perspective on formulating manipulation problems through the lens of regularity. Building upon this notion, we introduce three major contributions. First, we introduce methods that endow robots with object-centric priors, allowing them to learn generalizable, closed-loop sensorimotor policies from a small number of teleoperation demonstrations. Second, we introduce methods that constitute robots' spatial understanding, unlocking their ability to imitate manipulation skills from in-the-wild video observations. Last but not least, we introduce methods that enable robots to identify reusable skills from their past experiences, resulting in systems that can continually imitate multiple tasks in a sequential manner. Altogether, the contributions of this dissertation help lay the groundwork for building general-purpose personal robots that can quickly adapt to new situations or tasks with low-cost data collection and interact easily with humans. By enabling robots to learn and generalize from limited data, this dissertation takes a step toward realizing the vision of intelligent robotic assistants that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday scenarios.</p></details> | Ph.D. Dissertation |
| **[Fitts' List Revisited: An Empirical Study on Function Allocation in a Two-Agent Physical Human-Robot Collaborative Position/Force Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04722v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this letter, we investigate whether the classical function allocation holds for physical Human-Robot Collaboration, which is important for providing insights for Industry 5.0 to guide how to best augment rather than replace workers. This study empirically tests the applicability of Fitts' List within physical Human-Robot Collaboration, by conducting a user study (N=26, within-subject design) to evaluate four distinct allocations of position/force control between human and robot in an abstract blending task. We hypothesize that the function in which humans control the position achieves better performance and receives higher user ratings. When allocating position control to the human and force control to the robot, compared to the opposite case, we observed a significant improvement in preventing overblending. This was also perceived better in terms of physical demand and overall system acceptance, while participants experienced greater autonomy, more engagement and less frustration. An interesting insight was that the supervisory role (when the robot controls both position and force control) was rated second best in terms of subjective acceptance. Another surprising insight was that if position control was delegated to the robot, the participants perceived much lower autonomy than when the force control was delegated to the robot. These findings empirically support applying Fitts' principles to static function allocation for physical collaboration, while also revealing important nuanced user experience trade-offs, particularly regarding perceived autonomy when delegating position control.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, under review for publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

The proposed device is capable of moving, talking, and listening as people do, and can be used to automate spatially-stationary audio experiments, thus accelerating the pace of audio research. Critically, the device may also be used as a moving sound source in dynamic experiments, due to its quiet motor. This feature differentiates our work from previous robotic acoustic research platforms. Validation that the robot enables high quality audio data collection is provided through various experiments and acoustic measurements.

This idea is almost as old as modern robotics. Yet, while diverse general-purpose reasoning architectures have been proposed since, general-purpose systems that are integrated with modern robotic platforms have emerged only recently, starting with the influential ROSPlan system. Since then, a growing number of model-based systems for robot task-level control have emerged. In this paper, we consider the diverse design choices and issues existing systems attempt to address, the different solutions proposed so far, and suggest avenues for future development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Dynamic Soft Continuum Robot States From Boundaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04491v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate state estimation is essential for effective control of robots. For soft robots, this task is particularly challenging because their states are inherently infinite-dimensional functions due to the robots' continuous deformability. Traditional sensing techniques, however, can only provide discrete measurements. Recently, a dynamic state estimation method known as a boundary observer was introduced, which leverages Cosserat rod theory to recover all infinite-dimensional states by measuring only the velocity twist at the robot's tip. In this work, we present a novel boundary observer that can also recover infinite-dimensional dynamic states, but instead relies on measuring the internal wrench at the robot's base. This design exploits the duality between the velocity twist at the tip and the internal wrench at the base, with both types of boundary observers being inspired by principles of energy dissipation. Despite the mathematical duality, the proposed approach offers a distinct advantage: it requires only a 6-axis force/torque sensor embedded at the base, eliminating the need for external sensing systems such as motion capture cameras. Moreover, combining both tip- and base-based techniques enhances energy dissipation, accelerates convergence, and improves estimation accuracy. We validate the proposed algorithms through both simulation studies and experiments based on tendon-driven continuum robots. Our results demonstrate that all boundary observers converge to the ground truth within 3 seconds, even with significantly deviated initial conditions. Furthermore, they recover from unknown perturbations and effectively track high-frequency vibrations. We also show that combining the dual techniques further improves convergence speed and accuracy. Finally, the computational efficiency of these algorithms indicates their feasibility for real-time state estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03072v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently been successfully applied to a wide range of robotics applications for learning complex multi-modal behaviors from data. However, prior works have mostly been confined to single-robot and small-scale environments due to the high sample complexity of learning multi-robot diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a method for generating collision-free multi-robot trajectories that conform to underlying data distributions while using only single-robot data. Our algorithm, Multi-robot Multi-model planning Diffusion (MMD), does so by combining learned diffusion models with classical search-based techniques -- generating data-driven motions under collision constraints. Scaling further, we show how to compose multiple diffusion models to plan in large environments where a single diffusion model fails to generalize well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning for dozens of robots in a variety of simulated scenarios motivated by logistics environments.

| **[Occupancy World Model for Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05512v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and forecasting the scene evolutions deeply affect the exploration and decision of embodied agents. While traditional methods simulate scene evolutions through trajectory prediction of potential instances, current works use the occupancy world model as a generative framework for describing fine-grained overall scene dynamics. However, existing methods cluster on the outdoor structured road scenes, while ignoring the exploration of forecasting 3D occupancy scene evolutions for robots in indoor scenes. In this work, we explore a new framework for learning the scene evolutions of observed fine-grained occupancy and propose an occupancy world model based on the combined spatio-temporal receptive field and guided autoregressive transformer to forecast the scene evolutions, called RoboOccWorld. We propose the Conditional Causal State Attention (CCSA), which utilizes camera poses of next state as conditions to guide the autoregressive transformer to adapt and understand the indoor robotics scenarios. In order to effectively exploit the spatio-temporal cues from historical observations, Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Aggregation (HSTA) is proposed to obtain the combined spatio-temporal receptive field based on multi-scale spatio-temporal windows. In addition, we restructure the OccWorld-ScanNet benchmark based on local annotations to facilitate the evaluation of the indoor 3D occupancy scene evolution prediction task. Experimental results demonstrate that our RoboOccWorld outperforms state-of-the-art methods in indoor 3D occupancy scene evolution prediction task. The code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

While recent progress in natural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots' ability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the procedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open environments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge, a hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It consists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation (IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA). RoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural skill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition and execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83% average success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world data samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards integrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems, offering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://abliao.github.io/RoBridge/</p></details> |

| **[Beyond Task Performance: Human Experience in Human-Robot Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04182v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human interaction experience plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of human-machine collaboration, especially as interactions in future systems progress towards tighter physical and functional integration. While automation design has been shown to impact task performance, its influence on human experience metrics such as flow, sense of agency (SoA), and embodiment remains underexplored. This study investigates how variations in automation design affect these psychological experience measures and examines correlations between subjective experience and physiological indicators. A user study was conducted in a simulated wood workshop, where participants collaborated with a lightweight robot under four automation levels. The results of the study indicate that medium automation levels enhance flow, SoA and embodiment, striking a balance between support and user autonomy. In contrast, higher automation, despite optimizing task performance, diminishes perceived flow and agency. Furthermore, we observed that grip force might be considered as a real-time proxy of SoA, while correlations with heart rate variability were inconclusive. The findings underscore the necessity for automation strategies that integrate human- centric metrics, aiming to optimize both performance and user experience in collaborative robotic systems</p></details> |  |

This study introduces the SCU-Hand (Soft Conical Universal Robot Hand), a novel end-effector designed to automate the task of scooping powdered samples from various container sizes using a robotic arm. The SCU-Hand employs a flexible, conical structure that adapts to different container geometries through deformation, maintaining consistent contact without complex force sensing or machine learning-based control methods. Its reconfigurable mechanism allows for size adjustment, enabling efficient scooping from diverse container types. By combining soft robotics principles with a sheet-morphing design, our end-effector achieves high flexibility while retaining the necessary stiffness for effective powder manipulation. We detail the design principles, fabrication process, and experimental validation of the SCU-Hand. Experimental validation showed that the scooping capacity is about 20% higher than that of a commercial tool, with a scooping performance of more than 95% for containers of sizes between 67 mm to 110 mm. This research contributes to laboratory automation by offering a cost-effective, easily implementable solution for automating tasks such as materials synthesis and characterization processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA2025).

A key challenge in performing these tasks lies in achieving efficient and rapid path planning within complex environments. Sampling-based path planning methods, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree* (RRT*), have demonstrated notable performance in high-dimensional spaces. In recent years, researchers have begun designing various geometry-inspired heuristics and neural network-driven heuristics to further enhance the effectiveness of RRT*. However, the performance of these general path planning methods still requires improvement when applied to highly cluttered underwater environments. In this paper, we propose PierGuard, which combines the strengths of bidirectional search and neural network-driven heuristic regions. We design a specialized neural network to generate high-quality heuristic regions in cluttered maps, thereby improving the performance of the path planning. Through extensive simulation and real-world ocean field experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method compared with previous research. Our method achieves approximately 2.6 times the performance of the state-of-the-art geometric-based sampling method and nearly 4.9 times that of the state-of-the-art learning-based sampling method. Our results provide valuable insights for the automation of pier inspection and the enhancement of maritime safety.

Existing approaches, such as inertial navigation, Doppler Velocity Loggers (DVL), SLAM, and acoustic-based methods, face challenges like error accumulation and high computational complexity. Therefore, a more efficient and scalable solution remains necessary. This paper proposes an alternative approach that leverages an aerial drone equipped with GNSS localization to track and localize a marine robot once it is near the surface of the water. Our results show that this novel adaptation enables accurate single and multi-robot marine robot localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2025 Workshop Robots in the Wild</p></details> |

This paper presents an online controller synthesis framework tailored for robots equipped with deep learning-based perception components, with a focus on addressing distribution shifts. Our approach integrates periodic monitoring and repair mechanisms for the deep neural network perception component, followed by uncertainty reassessment. These uncertainty evaluations are injected into a parametric discrete-time markov chain, enabling the synthesis of robust controllers via probabilistic model checking. To ensure high system availability during the repair process, we propose a dual-component configuration that seamlessly transitions between operational states. Through a case study on robot collision avoidance, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method, showcasing substantial performance improvements over baseline approaches.

This study systematically examines trust dynamics and system design by analyzing human reactions to robot failures. We conducted a four-stage survey to explore how trust evolves throughout human-robot interactions. The first stage collected demographic data and initial trust levels. The second stage focused on preliminary expectations and perceptions of robotic capabilities. The third stage examined interaction details, including robot precision and error acknowledgment. Finally, the fourth stage assessed post-interaction perceptions, evaluating trust dynamics, forgiveness, and willingness to recommend robotic technologies. Results indicate that trust in robotic systems significantly increased when robots acknowledged their errors or limitations. Additionally, participants showed greater willingness to suggest robots for future tasks, highlighting the importance of direct engagement in shaping trust dynamics. These findings provide valuable insights for designing more transparent, responsive, and trustworthy robotic systems. By enhancing our understanding of human-robot interaction (HRI), this study contributes to the development of robotic technologies that foster greater public acceptance and adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, Ongoing Research</p></details> |

To be able to successfully interact with humans, they need to understand and analyse socially interactive scenes from their (robot's) perspective. Works that model social situations between humans and agents are few; and even those existing ones are often too computationally intensive to be suitable for deployment in real time or on real world scenarios with limited available information. We propose a robust knowledge distillation framework that models social interactions through various multimodal cues, yet is robust against incomplete and noisy information during inference. Our teacher model is trained with multimodal input (body, face and hand gestures, gaze, raw images) that transfers knowledge to a student model that relies solely on body pose. Extensive experiments on two publicly available human-robot interaction datasets demonstrate that the our student model achieves an average accuracy gain of 14.75\% over relevant baselines on multiple downstream social understanding task even with up to 51\% of its input being corrupted. The student model is highly efficient: it is $<1$\% in size of the teacher model in terms of parameters and uses $\sim 0.5$\textperthousand~FLOPs of that in the teacher model. Our code will be made public during publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |

While gaze-tracking has emerged as a promising method for robotic assistance, existing solutions lack sufficient feedback mechanisms, leading to uncertainty in user intent recognition and reduced adaptability. This paper presents the MIHRAGe interface, an integrated system that combines gaze-tracking, robotic assistance, and a mixed-reality to create an immersive environment for controlling the robot using only eye movements. The system was evaluated through an experimental protocol involving four participants, assessing gaze accuracy, robotic positioning precision, and the overall success of a pick and place task. Results showed an average gaze fixation error of 1.46 cm, with individual variations ranging from 1.28 cm to 2.14 cm. The robotic arm demonstrated an average positioning error of +-1.53 cm, with discrepancies attributed to interface resolution and calibration constraints. In a pick and place task, the system achieved a success rate of 80%, highlighting its potential for improving accessibility in human-robot interaction with visual feedback to the user.</p></details> |  |
