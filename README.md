| **[Unlocking 3D Affordance Segmentation with 2D Semantic Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08316v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain. Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise, prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D affordance segmentation.</p></details> | Work in process |

While current learning tools show promise for speaking practice, most focus on dyadic, scripted scenarios, limiting opportunities for dynamic group interactions. To address this gap, we present ConversAR, a Mixed Reality system that leverages Generative AI and XR to support situated and personalized group conversations. It integrates embodied AI agents, scene recognition, and generative 3D props anchored to real-world surroundings. Based on a formative study with experts in language acquisition, we developed and tested this system with a user study with 21 second-language learners. Results indicate that the system enhanced learner engagement, increased willingness to communicate, and offered a safe space for speaking. We discuss the implications for integrating Generative AI and XR into the design of future language learning applications.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Executable Analytic Concepts as the Missing Link Between VLM Insight and Precise Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07975v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to perform precise and generalized manipulation in unstructured environments remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in semantic reasoning and task planning, a significant gap persists between their high-level understanding and the precise physical execution required for real-world manipulation. To bridge this "semantic-to-physical" gap, we introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world environments, without requiring task-specific training.</p></details> |  |
| **[CORE-3D: Context-aware Open-vocabulary Retrieval by Embeddings in 3D](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24528v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics, supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, submitted for ICLR 2026 conference</p></details> |
| **[GTR-Bench: Evaluating Geo-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07791v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Bring the Apple, Not the Sofa: Impact of Irrelevant Context in Embodied AI Commands on VLA Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07067v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Action (VLA) models are widely used in Embodied AI, enabling robots to interpret and execute language instructions. However, their robustness to natural language variability in real-world scenarios has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a novel systematic study of the robustness of state-of-the-art VLA models under linguistic perturbations. Specifically, we evaluate model performance under two types of instruction noise: (1) human-generated paraphrasing and (2) the addition of irrelevant context. We further categorize irrelevant contexts into two groups according to their length and their semantic and lexical proximity to robot commands. In this study, we observe consistent performance degradation as context size expands. We also demonstrate that the model can exhibit relative robustness to random context, with a performance drop within 10%, while semantically and lexically similar context of the same length can trigger a quality decline of around 50%. Human paraphrases of instructions lead to a drop of nearly 20%. To mitigate this, we propose an LLM-based filtering framework that extracts core commands from noisy inputs. Incorporating our filtering step allows models to recover up to 98.5% of their original performance under noisy conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Safety Challenge of World Models for Embodied AI Agents: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05865v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret, and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a quantitative evaluation of the results.</p></details> |  |
| **[D2E: Scaling Vision-Action Pretraining on Desktop Data for Transfer to Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05684v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection. Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative: they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction, enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation. Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at https://worv-ai.github.io/d2e/</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Brain: A Neuroscience-inspired Framework for Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07634v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted from static, data-driven models to dynamic systems capable of perceiving and interacting with real-world environments. Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 17 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Your Vision-Language Model Can't Even Count to 20: Exposing the Failures of VLMs in Compositional Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04401v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become a central focus of today's AI community, owing to their impressive abilities gained from training on large-scale vision-language data from the Web. These models have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark, VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation. Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[INGRID: Intelligent Generative Robotic Design Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03842v3)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.</p></details> | We are revising it |
| **[Generating Human Motion Videos using a Cascaded Text-to-Video Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03909v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human video generation is becoming an increasingly important task with broad applications in graphics, entertainment, and embodied AI. Despite the rapid progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation. It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs, mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions, conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, Project Page:https://hyelinnam.github.io/Cameo/</p></details> |
| **[Improving Cooperation in Collaborative Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03153v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into multiagent systems has opened new possibilities for collaborative reasoning and cooperation with AI agents. This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making. We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task coordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for iterative system development and demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of UKCI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Action Deviation-Aware Inference for Low-Latency Wireless Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02851v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target model and selectively skips communication and computation for server operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model only inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA-R1: Enhancing Reasoning in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01623v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1.

| **[Beyond Needle(s) in the Embodied Haystack: Environment, Architecture, and Training Considerations for Long Context Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16928v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce $\infty$-THOR, a new framework for long-horizon embodied tasks that advances long-context understanding in embodied AI. $\infty$-THOR provides: (1) a generation framework for synthesizing scalable, reproducible, and unlimited long-horizon trajectories; (2) a novel embodied QA task, Needle(s) in the Embodied Haystack, where multiple scattered clues across extended trajectories test agents' long-context reasoning ability; and (3) a long-horizon dataset and benchmark suite featuring complex tasks that span hundreds of environment steps, each paired with ground-truth action sequences. To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust, long-term reasoning and planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing through Uncertainty: Robust Task-Oriented Optimization in Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00441v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual navigation is a fundamental problem in embodied AI, yet practical deployments demand long-horizon planning capabilities to address multi-objective tasks. A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned from limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural network-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that paradoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper introduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization. Specifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it transforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal calibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii) it reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization problem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments. Extensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation tasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in generalization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[CHAI: Command Hijacking against embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00181v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to handle edge cases in robotic vehicle systems where data is scarce by using common-sense reasoning grounded in perception and action to generalize beyond training distributions and adapt to novel real-world situations. These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete. Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models, provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand, advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[OceanGym: A Benchmark Environment for Underwater Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26536v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility, dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are available at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[What Can RL Bring to VLA Generalization? An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

However, existing interactive segmentation methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained, multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new 3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale, scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines, PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, conference</p></details> |

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Embodied Planning with Verifiable Reward for Real-World Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25852v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the planner. We will open-source both the dataset and the trained model upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning with Vision-Language Models in Ego-Centric Multi-View Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06266v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-and-Language Navigation with Analogical Textual Descriptions in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25139v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions. We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in navigation performance.</p></details> |  |

A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end, with agents generating messages and actions concurrently. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), to simulate future states. Agents then communicate a summary of this plan. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI.

Yet prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge; and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders, suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability. Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time, and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across four public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a poster in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Intentional Gesture: Deliver Your Intentions with Gestures for Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15197v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When humans speak, gestures help convey communicative intentions, such as adding emphasis or describing concepts. However, current co-speech gesture generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (e.g. speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To address this gap, we introduce Intentional-Gesture, a novel framework that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in high-level communicative functions. First, we curate the InG dataset by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (i.e., text sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the Intentional Gesture Motion Tokenizer to leverage these intention annotations. It injects high-level communicative functions (e.g., intentions) into tokenized motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture</p></details> |  |
| **[Can AI Perceive Physical Danger and Intervene?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21651v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent -- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions. The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at https://asimov-benchmark.github.io/v2</p></details> |  |

Interactable digital twins of such objects have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. Unfortunately, current methods to digitize articulated real-world objects require carefully captured data, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable acquisition. We focus on motion analysis and part-level segmentation of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to obtain at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is challenging due to simultaneous object and camera motion and significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iTACO: a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories that is 20$\times$ larger than available in prior work. We then compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Our experiments show that iTACO outperforms existing articulated object digital twin methods on both synthetic and real casually captured RGBD videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website can be found at https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/video2articulation/</p></details> |
| **[Embodied AI: From LLMs to World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20021v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models (WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building internal representations and future predictions of the external world, facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances, covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e., embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs, meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE CASM</p></details> |

While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

However, deploying such agents in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes. Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards real-world assistive robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plan Verification for LLM-Based Embodied Task Completion Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02761v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions, redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout). The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25 fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view), providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially, we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the leaderboards of Embodied Arena.

Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.</p></details> |  |

As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate improvements of 20% and 40% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover, our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87-0.97) for the reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to diverse environments with minimal effort.

| **[Elevating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs with Auxiliary Embedding Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09585v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, the standard practice for developing MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/visper_lm/</p></details> |

The main limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent, which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models (VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emulating Human-like Adaptive Vision for Efficient and Flexible Machine Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15333v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition.

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

To overcome these obstacles, we propose RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

| **[Embodied Navigation Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12129v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation is a fundamental capability in embodied AI, representing the intelligence required to perceive and interact within physical environments following language instructions. Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pku-epic.github.io/NavFoM-Web/</p></details> |

Compared to traditional pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision.

For example, such knowledge directs an agent to grasp a knife by the handle for cutting or by the blade for safe handover. While existing approaches have made notable progress, affordance research still faces three key challenges: data scarcity, poor generalization, and real-world deployment. Specifically, there is a lack of large-scale affordance datasets with precise segmentation maps, existing models struggle to generalize across different domains or novel object and affordance classes, and little work demonstrates deployability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a complete affordance learning system that (1) takes in egocentric videos and outputs precise affordance annotations without human labeling, (2) leverages geometric information and vision foundation models to improve generalization, and (3) introduces a framework that facilitates affordance-oriented robotic manipulation such as tool grasping and robot-to-human tool handover. Experimental results show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by 13.8% in mIoU, and the framework achieves 77.1% successful grasping among 179 trials, including evaluations on seen, unseen classes, and cluttered scenes.

| **[Integrating Prior Observations for Incremental 3D Scene Graph Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11895v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships. While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world, incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g., CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented architecture will be made available at https://github.com/m4renz/incremental-scene-graph-prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 24th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'25)</p></details> |

It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents.

| **[Nav-R1: Reasoning and Navigation in Embodied Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10884v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation requires agents to integrate perception, reasoning, and action for robust interaction in complex 3D environments. Existing approaches often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought (CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format, understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its robustness under limited onboard resources. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/Nav-R1.

However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v6)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |

Traditional sequential computation patterns, while effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by 2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and providing high throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://aopolin-lv.github.io/F1-VLA/</p></details> |

World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: multi-modal multi-task foundation models (M3T-FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas federated learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied AI environments. In this vision paper, we introduce multi-modal multi-task federated foundation models (M3T-FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of M3T-FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed training nature of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical deployment dimensions of M3T-FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning, Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for deploying M3T-FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs. Finally, we present a prototype implementation of M3T-FFMs and evaluate their energy and latency performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in IEEE Internet of Things Magazine, 2025</p></details> |

While existing methods have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication to encourage future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Model Implanting for Test-time Adaptation of Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03956v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models, the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability. In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  |

Unlike virtual AI, EAI systems can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. With recent advances in AI models and hardware, EAI systems are becoming increasingly capable across wider operational domains. While EAI systems can offer many benefits, they also pose significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, as well as economic and societal disruption. These risks require urgent attention from policymakers, as existing policies governing industrial robots and autonomous vehicles are insufficient to address the full range of concerns EAI systems present. To help address this issue, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a taxonomy of the physical, informational, economic, and social risks EAI systems pose. Second, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to assess how existing frameworks address these risks and to identify critical gaps. We conclude by offering policy recommendations for the safe and beneficial deployment of EAI systems, such as mandatory testing and certification schemes, clarified liability frameworks, and strategies to manage EAI's potentially transformative economic and societal impacts.</p></details> |  |

However, EAI systems introduce critical security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety, how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries; (2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with 2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3) ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era.

Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models.

Existing omnidirectional methods achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the \textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories (\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance).

However, traditional SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction, and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians.

| **[Large VLM-based Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13073v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |
| **[RobotxR1: Enabling Embodied Robotic Intelligence on Large Language Models through Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03238v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future robotic systems operating in real-world environments will require on-board embodied intelligence without continuous cloud connection, balancing capabilities with constraints on computational power and memory. This work presents an extension of the R1-zero approach, which enables the usage of low parameter-count Large Language Models (LLMs) in the robotic domain. The R1-Zero approach was originally developed to enable mathematical reasoning in LLMs using static datasets. We extend it to the robotics domain through integration in a closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. This extension enhances reasoning in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) settings without relying solely on distillation of large models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We show that small-scale LLMs can achieve effective reasoning performance by learning through closed-loop interaction with their environment, which enables tasks that previously required significantly larger models. In an autonomous driving setting, a performance gain of 20.2%-points over the SFT-based baseline is observed with a Qwen2.5-1.5B model. Using the proposed training procedure, Qwen2.5-3B achieves a 63.3% control adaptability score, surpassing the 58.5% obtained by the much larger, cloud-bound GPT-4o. These results highlight that practical, on-board deployment of small LLMs is not only feasible but can outperform larger models if trained through environmental feedback, underscoring the importance of an interactive learning framework for robotic Embodied AI, one grounded in practical experience rather than static supervision.</p></details> |  |

This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the emergence of Multi-modal Large Models (MLMs) and World Models (WMs) have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable perception, interaction, and reasoning capabilities, making them a promising architecture for embodied agents. In this survey, we give a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements in Embodied AI.

Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> |
| **[FetchBot: Learning Generalizable Object Fetching in Cluttered Scenes via Zero-Shot Sim2Real](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17894v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizable object fetching in cluttered scenes remains a fundamental and application-critical challenge in embodied AI. Closely packed objects cause inevitable occlusions, making safe action generation particularly difficult. Under such partial observability, effective policies must not only generalize across diverse objects and layouts but also reason about occlusion to avoid collisions. However, collecting large-scale real-world data for this task remains prohibitively expensive, leaving this problem largely unsolved. In this paper, we introduce FetchBot, a sim-to-real framework for this challenge. We first curate a large-scale synthetic dataset featuring 1M diverse scenes and 500k representative demonstrations. Based on this dataset, FetchBot employs a depth-conditioned method for action generation, which leverages structural cues to enable robust obstacle-aware action planning. However, depth is perfect in simulation but noisy in real-world environments. To address this sim-to-real gap, FetchBot predicts depth from RGB inputs using a foundation model and integrates local occupancy prediction as a pre-training task, providing a generalizable latent representation for sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the strong zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, effective clutter handling, and adaptability to novel scenarios. In cluttered environments, it achieves an average real-world success rate of 89.95%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, FetchBot demonstrates excellent robustness in challenging cases, such as fetching transparent, reflective, and irregular objects, highlighting its practical value.</p></details> | <details><summary>9th A...</summary><p>9th Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025, Oral)</p></details> |

In this work, we address the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture. Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval; (ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of 3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass; (iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation, potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks.

However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution, and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands. This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500 complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot. We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.</p></details> |  |

Vision-Language-Action models, inspired by advancements in large foundation models, serve as universal robotic control frameworks that substantially improve agent-environment interaction capabilities in embodied intelligence systems. This expansion has broadened application scenarios for embodied AI robots. This survey comprehensively reviews VLA models for embodied manipulation. Firstly, it chronicles the developmental trajectory of VLA architectures. Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of current research across 5 critical dimensions: VLA model structures, training datasets, pre-training methods, post-training methods, and model evaluation. Finally, we synthesize key challenges in VLA development and real-world deployment, while outlining promising future research directions.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

To formalize this setting, we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by both LLM-based and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + 2 pages references + 7 pages appendix</p></details> |

However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Embod...</summary><p>Embodied-R1 technical report</p></details> |

In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |

However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We present Switch4EAI(Switch-for-Embodied-AI), a low-cost and easily deployable pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games to evaluate whole-body robot control policies. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future work to for benchmarking embodied AI.</p></details> | Workshop Submission |
| **[Virtuous Machines: Towards Artificial General Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13421v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness, executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments, accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored. It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and the attribution of scientific credit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied Image Quality Assessment for Robotic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18774v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of User-Generated Content (UGC) is a critical technique for human Quality of Experience (QoE). However, does the the image quality of Robot-Generated Content (RGC) demonstrate traits consistent with the Moravec paradox, potentially conflicting with human perceptual norms? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the perception mechanism of embodied robots for image quality. We propose the first Embodied Preference Database (EPD), which contains 12,500 distorted image annotations. We establish assessment metrics based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, there is a gap between UGC and RGC. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-scale Attention Embodied Image Quality Assessment called MA-EIQA. For the proposed EPD dataset, this is the first no-reference IQA model designed for embodied robot. Finally, the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.</p></details> |  |

We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Affordance-Aware Robotic Dexterous Grasping with Human-like Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08896v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage, a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects, unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open dynamic environments. Recent breakthroughs in large models have revolutionized embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms, detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution, and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing decision-making and learning.

General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization, which limits their applicability in embodied AI such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose a skill-oriented MoE called MoSE, which mimics the human learning and reasoning process skill-by-skill, step-by-step. We introduce a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. To better align with multi-step planning in human reasoning and in end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike other multi-round dialogues, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g. perception-prediction-planning for AD, and high-level and low-level planning for robots) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model effectively grows more diverse expertise and outperforms models on both AD corner-case reasoning tasks and robot reasoning tasks with less than 40% of the parameters.</p></details> |  |

Generating synthetic images that closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins, facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using images generated by DiffPhysCam.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 17 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

This task requires the model to identify newly described objects that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that 3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

As robotics and automated systems scale, efficient data-sharing frameworks and robust algorithms become critical. We explore the pivotal role of data handling in next-gen networks, focusing on dynamics between application and network providers (AP/NP) in DT ecosystems. We introduce PANAMA, a novel algorithm with Priority Asymmetry for Network Aware Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based multi-agent path finding (MAPF). By adopting a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework and asynchronous actor-learner architectures, PANAMA accelerates training while enabling autonomous task execution by embodied AI. Our approach demonstrates superior pathfinding performance in accuracy, speed, and scalability compared to existing benchmarks. Through simulations, we highlight optimized data-sharing strategies for scalable, automated systems, ensuring resilience in complex, real-world environments. PANAMA bridges the gap between network-aware decision-making and robust multi-agent coordination, advancing the synergy between DTs, wireless networks, and AI-driven automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety of Embodied Navigation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05855v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention, particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety and increasing industrial efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniEAR: Benchmarking Agent Reasoning in Embodied Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05614v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to 56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically (0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/OmniEmbodied Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/OmniEmbodied</p></details> |

In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentSense: Virtual Sensor Data Generation Using LLM Agents in Simulated Home Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11773v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.</p></details> |  |

The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

| **[Agent Learning via Early Experience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08558v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks. However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards (e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Play to Generalize: Learning to Reason Through Game Play](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08011v4)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by literature suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable reasoning skills, we propose a novel post-training method, Visual Game Learning (ViGaL), where MLLMs develop generalizable reasoning skills through playing arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that training a 7B-parameter MLLM via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple games like Snake significantly enhances the downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks like MathVista, on multi-discipline questions like MMMU and on 3D spatial reasoning benchmarks like VSI-Bench, without seeing any worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist models post-trained on benchmark-oriented multimodal reasoning data, while preserving the model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest that multimodal reasoning can emerge from gameplay, pointing to a promising strategy of designing surrogate tasks for RL post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunfeixie233.github.io/ViGaL/</p></details> |
| **[Improving Reasoning for Diffusion Language Models via Group Diffusion Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08554v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Group Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines, on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Our approach demonstrates broad effectiveness across different domains: 1) for large language models(LLMs), boosting the AIME 2025 score for Qwen2.5-Math-7B by 37.4%; 2) for continuous control reinforcement learning agents, improving performance by more than 30% over strong baselines such as SAC on the challenging HumanoidBench; 3) for image classification, enhancing ImageNet top-1 accuracy by 0.69% for ResNet-50. These gains are achieved with a computational overhead of less than 7%. Our work validates output activation as a powerful tool for entropy control, opening a new direction for designing simpler and more robust algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[MM-HELIX: Boosting Multimodal Long-Chain Reflective Reasoning with Holistic Platform and Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08540v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability. Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way for developing more capable MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the optimization dynamics of RLVR: Gradient gap and step size thresholds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08539v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels. Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpatialLadder: Progressive Training for Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08531v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization, single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks, demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is essential for robust spatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/SpatialLadder/ Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/SpatialLadder</p></details> |

Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning (RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |

Thus, even when successful, it is difficult to characterize which policies will be learned and what they will do. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to a particular optimal policy, via vanishing entropy regularization and a temperature decoupling gambit. Our approach realizes an interpretable, diversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes and ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and return distributions. In a particular instance of our method, for example, the realized policy samples all optimal actions uniformly. Leveraging our temperature decoupling gambit, we present an algorithm that estimates, to arbitrary accuracy, the return distribution associated to its interpretable, diversity-preserving optimal policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025.

RL-Guided KV Cache Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08525v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV) cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.</p></details> |  |

We present DYNAMIX, a reinforcement learning framework that formulates batch size optimization as a sequential decision-making problem using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Our approach employs a multi-dimensional state representation encompassing network-level metrics, system-level resource utilization, and training statistical efficiency indicators to enable informed decision-making across diverse computational resources. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit system modeling while integrating seamlessly with existing distributed training frameworks. Through evaluations across diverse workloads, hardware configurations, and network conditions, DYNAMIX achieves up to 6.3% improvement in the final model accuracy and 46% reduction in the total training time. Our scalability experiments demonstrate that DYNAMIX maintains the best performance as cluster size increases to 32 nodes, while policy transfer experiments show that learned policies generalize effectively across related model architectures.</p></details> |  |

Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations. Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to support development and evaluation of visual CoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>datas...</summary><p>dataset link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/multimodal-reasoning-lab/Zebra-CoT</p></details> |
| **[Scaling up Multi-Turn Off-Policy RL and Multi-Agent Tree Search for LLM Step-Provers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06493v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space, enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon multi-turn reasoning and complex search.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-STAR: Reinforcing Open-Vocabulary Action Recognition with Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08480v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination. Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2, Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent robustness and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Football by Exploiting Equilibrium Structure of 2p0s Differential Games with One-Sided Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00560v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a two-player imperfect-information extensive-form game (IIEFG) with $K$ time steps and a player action space of size $U$, the game tree complexity is $U^{2K}$, causing existing IIEFG solvers to struggle with large or infinite $(U,K)$, e.g., differential games with continuous action spaces. To partially address this scalability challenge, we focus on an important class of 2p0s games where the informed player (P1) knows the payoff while the uninformed player (P2) only has a belief over the set of $I$ possible payoffs. Such games encompass a wide range of scenarios in sports, defense, cybersecurity, and finance. We prove that under mild conditions, P1's (resp. P2's) equilibrium strategy at any infostate concentrates on at most $I$ (resp. $I+1$) action prototypes. When $I\ll U$, this equilibrium structure causes the game tree complexity to collapse to $I^K$ for P1 when P2 plays pure best responses, and $(I+1)^K$ for P2 in a dual game where P1 plays pure best responses. We then show that exploiting this structure in standard learning modes, i.e., model-free multiagent reinforcement learning and model predictive control, is straightforward, leading to significant improvements in learning accuracy and efficiency from SOTA IIEFG solvers. Our demonstration solves a 22-player football game ($K=10$, $U=\infty$) where the attacking team has to strategically conceal their intention until a critical moment in order to exploit information advantage.

Provenance collection is often incorporated into the reference monitor of systems to ensure that an audit trail exists of all events, that events are completely captured, and that logging of such events cannot be bypassed. However, recent research has questioned whether existing state-of-the-art provenance collection systems fail to ensure the security guarantees of a true reference monitor due to the 'super producer threat' in which provenance generation can overload a system to force the system to drop security-relevant events and allow an attacker to hide their actions. One approach towards solving this threat is to enforce resource isolation, but that does not fully solve the problems resulting from hardware dependencies and performance limitations. In this paper, we show how an operating system's kernel scheduler can mitigate this threat, and we introduce Venus, a learned scheduler for Linux specifically designed for provenance. Unlike conventional schedulers that ignore provenance completeness requirements, Venus leverages reinforcement learning to learn provenance task behavior and to dynamically optimize resource allocation. We evaluate Venus's efficacy and show that Venus significantly improves both the completeness and efficiency of provenance collection systems compared to traditional scheduling, while maintaining reasonable overheads and even improving overall runtime in certain cases compared to the default Linux scheduler.</p></details> |  |
| **[More Than One Teacher: Adaptive Multi-Guidance Policy Optimization for Diverse Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02227v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover, AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend, thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability. Our code is available at https://github.com/SII-Enigma/AMPO.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

Operating directly on third-person videos of humans manipulating rigid objects, DexMan eliminates the need for camera calibration, depth sensors, scanned 3D object assets, or ground-truth hand and object motion annotations. Unlike prior approaches that consider only simplified floating hands, it directly controls a humanoid robot and leverages novel contact-based rewards to improve policy learning from noisy hand-object poses estimated from in-the-wild videos. DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation on the TACO benchmark, with absolute gains of 0.08 and 0.12 in ADD-S and VSD. Meanwhile, its reinforcement learning policy surpasses previous methods by 19% in success rate on OakInk-v2. Furthermore, DexMan can generate skills from both real and synthetic videos, without the need for manual data collection and costly motion capture, and enabling the creation of large-scale, diverse datasets for training generalist dexterous manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video results are available at: https://embodiedai-ntu.github.io/dexman/index.html</p></details> |

Supporting over 20 benchmark variants ranging from simple algorithmic tests like Bernstein-Vazirani to complex Hamiltonian simulation with observable calculations, the system integrates with multiple circuit generation APIs (Qiskit, CUDA-Q, Cirq) and enables diverse workflows. We validate the architecture through successful integration with Sandia's $\textit{pyGSTi}$ for advanced circuit analysis and CUDA-Q for multi-GPU HPC simulations. Extensibility of the system is demonstrated by implementing dynamic circuit variants of existing benchmarks and a new quantum reinforcement learning benchmark, which become readily available across multiple execution and analysis modes. Our primary contribution is identifying and formalizing modular interfaces that enable interoperability between incompatible benchmarking frameworks, demonstrating that standardized interfaces reduce ecosystem fragmentation while preserving optimization flexibility. This architecture has been developed as a key enhancement to the continually evolving QED-C Application-Oriented Performance Benchmarks for Quantum Computing suite.</p></details> |  |

RL has achieved remarkable success in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for broader reasoning models.

While reliable, such binary feedback is brittle--many tasks admit partially correct or alternative answers that verifiers under-credit, and the resulting all-or-nothing supervision limits learning. Reward models offer richer, continuous feedback, which can serve as a complementary supervisory signal to verifiers. We introduce HERO (Hybrid Ensemble Reward Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that integrates verifier signals with reward-model scores in a structured way. HERO employs stratified normalization to bound reward-model scores within verifier-defined groups, preserving correctness while refining quality distinctions, and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging prompts where dense signals matter most. Across diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines, with strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks. Our results show that hybrid reward design retains the stability of verifiers while leveraging the nuance of reward models to advance reasoning.</p></details> | 21 pages |

This forces agents to waste exploration and computational resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://andrewcwlee.github.io/gaze-on-the-prize</p></details> |

Static escalation rules and keyword heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned, cost-aware LLM orchestration.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 4 Figures, 2 Tables</p></details> |

In this work, we present the first sample complexity bound for BRL, establishing a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ in continuous state-action spaces. Traditional MDP analysis techniques do not extend to BRL due to its nested structure and non-convex lower-level problems. We overcome these challenges by leveraging the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition and the MDP structure to obtain closed-form gradients, enabling tight sample complexity analysis. Our analysis also extends to general bi-level optimization settings with non-convex lower levels, where we achieve state-of-the-art sample complexity results of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ improving upon existing bounds of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Additionally, we address the computational bottleneck of hypergradient estimation by proposing a fully first-order, Hessian-free algorithm suitable for large-scale problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is updated version of the paper 2410.15610</p></details> |

We introduce ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes. ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural language justifications. Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data, ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%. These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and the EU AI Act.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 6th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF 2025), Singapore.

| **[Reinforcing Diffusion Models by Direct Group Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08425v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning (RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems. Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/OpenStellarTeam/QAgent</p></details> |
| **[Physics-informed Value Learner for Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06782v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) holds great promise for domains such as autonomous navigation and locomotion, where collecting interactive data is costly and unsafe. However, it remains challenging in practice due to the need to learn from datasets with limited coverage of the state-action space and to generalize across long-horizon tasks. To improve on these challenges, we propose a \emph{Physics-informed (Pi)} regularized loss for value learning, derived from the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and which induces a geometric inductive bias in the learned value function. Unlike generic gradient penalties that are primarily used to stabilize training, our formulation is grounded in continuous-time optimal control and encourages value functions to align with cost-to-go structures. The proposed regularizer is broadly compatible with temporal-difference-based value learning and can be integrated into existing Offline GCRL algorithms. When combined with Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL), the resulting method, Eikonal-regularized HIQL (Eik-HIQL), yields significant improvements in both performance and generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale navigation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Trained offline on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, DeepEN generates 4-hourly recommendations for caloric, protein, and fluid intake tailored to each patient's evolving physiology. The model integrates a curated, clinically informed state space with a custom reward function that balances short-term physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival outcomes. Using a dueling double deep Q-network with conservative Q-learning regularization, DeepEN learns clinically realistic policies that align with high-value clinician actions while discouraging unsafe deviations. Across various qualitative and quantitative metrics, DeepEN outperforms clinician-derived and guideline-based policies, achieving a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17 percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%) and improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. These findings highlight the potential of safe, data-driven personalization of EN therapy to improve outcomes beyond traditional guideline- or heuristic-based approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Pass@k: Breadth-Depth Metrics for Reasoning Boundaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08325v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

In this work, we study a natural actor-critic (NAC) algorithm that integrates recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures into a natural policy gradient (NPG) method and a temporal difference (TD) learning method. This framework leverages the representational capacity of RNNs to address non-stationarity in RL to solve POMDPs while retaining the statistical and computational efficiency of natural gradient methods in RL. We provide non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees for this method, including bounds on sample and iteration complexity to achieve global optimality up to function approximation. Additionally, we characterize pathological cases that stem from long-term dependencies, thereby explaining limitations of RNN-based policy optimization for POMDPs.</p></details> |  |

We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.</p></details> |  |

A comparative analysis is conducted between classical PID controllers and modern reinforcement learning algorithms, including Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). The results demonstrate that TRPO outperforms other methods, achieving the lowest root mean square (RMS) errors across various trajectories and exhibiting robustness to larger time intervals between control updates. TRPO's ability to balance exploration and exploitation enables stable control in noisy, real-world environments, reducing reliance on high-frequency sensor feedback and computational demands. These findings highlight TRPO's potential as a robust solution for complex robotic control tasks, with implications for dynamic environments and future applications in sensor fusion or hybrid control strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mix- and MoE-DPO: A Variational Inference Approach to Direct Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08256v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes; and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Opponent Shaping in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08255v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players' learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma). Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent LLM research.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 15 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |
| **[The Alignment Waltz: Jointly Training Agents to Collaborate for Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08240v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content, and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets, demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g., from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto front between helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Reasoning for Diffusion LLMs via Distribution Matching Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08233v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are promising alternatives to autoregressive large language models (AR-LLMs), as they potentially allow higher inference throughput. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks, such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs' unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\%$ over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\%$ over the base model, underscoring the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework.

| **[Reinforcement Learning from Probabilistic Forecasts for Safe Decision-Making via Conditional Value-at-Risk Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08226v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than maximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management. This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions. We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\% and sMAPE by 32\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These results show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust, generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[SaFeR-VLM: Toward Safety-aware Fine-grained Reasoning in Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06871v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I) QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering. SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$ larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B. Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any degradation in helpfulness performance.

| **[Expressive Value Learning for Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08218v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics, principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining. Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value learning into offline RL.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08191v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO), a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples, Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training data and cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Horizon: How Far Can Your Large Reasoning Model Really Go in Breadth and Depth?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08189v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition. Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data, RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Low-Level MPC for Multi-Agent Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15799v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving safe and coordinated behavior in dynamic, constraint-rich environments remains a major challenge for learning-based control. Pure end-to-end learning often suffers from poor sample efficiency and limited reliability, while model-based methods depend on predefined references and struggle to generalize. We propose a hierarchical framework that combines tactical decision-making via reinforcement learning (RL) with low-level execution through Model Predictive Control (MPC). For the case of multi-agent systems this means that high-level policies select abstract targets from structured regions of interest (ROIs), while MPC ensures dynamically feasible and safe motion. Tested on a predator-prey benchmark, our approach outperforms end-to-end and shielding-based RL baselines in terms of reward, safety, and consistency, underscoring the benefits of combining structured learning with model-based control.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARM2: Adaptive Reasoning Model with Vision Understanding and Executable Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08163v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking'' problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific, lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

In particular, our agents learn: efficient logarithmic-depth quantum circuits for the Quantum Fourier Transform; Grover's search algorithm; optimal cheating strategies for strong coin flipping; and optimal winning strategies for the CHSH and other nonlocal games. The agents achieve these results directly through interaction, without prior access to known optimal solutions. This demonstrates the potential of quantum intelligence as a tool for algorithmic discovery, opening the way for the automated design of novel quantum algorithms and protocols.</p></details> |  |

However, existing frameworks commonly face challenges such as inference bottlenecks and complexity barriers, which restrict their accessibility to newcomers. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{OpenRLHF}, a user-friendly, scalable, and easy-to-learn open-source RLHF framework built upon Ray, vLLM, DeepSpeed, and HuggingFace Transformers, featuring a simplified design, clear code structure, and comprehensive documentation to facilitate entry for researchers and practitioners. Experimental results show that OpenRLHF achieves superior training efficiency, with speedups ranging from 1.22x to 1.68x across different model sizes, compared to state-of-the-art frameworks. Additionally, it requires significantly fewer lines of code for implementation. OpenRLHF is publicly available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF, and has already been adopted by leading institutions to accelerate RLHF research and learning.</p></details> | update template |

Existing AR video diffusion models are limited to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control, then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page: https://kesenzhao.github.io/AR-Drag.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Skill-based approaches tackle this by decomposing state-action sequences into reusable skills and employing hierarchical decision-making. However, these methods are highly susceptible to noisy offline demonstrations, leading to unstable skill learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Self-Improving Skill Learning (SISL), which performs self-guided skill refinement using decoupled high-level and skill improvement policies, while applying skill prioritization via maximum return relabeling to focus updates on task-relevant trajectories, resulting in robust and stable adaptation even under noisy and suboptimal data. By mitigating the effect of noise, SISL achieves reliable skill learning and consistently outperforms other skill-based meta-RL methods on diverse long-horizon tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages main, 25 pages appendix with reference.

Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text, multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[TaoSR-AGRL: Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning Framework for E-commerce Search Relevance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08048v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative, reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance. TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coefficients-Preserving Sampling for Reinforcement Learning with Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05952v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models, specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method, Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Reducing Cognitive Overhead in Tool Use via Multi-Small-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08882v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multi-agent systems highlight the potential of specialized small agents that collaborate via division of labor. Existing tool-integrated reasoning systems, however, often follow a single-agent paradigm in which one large model interleaves long-horizon reasoning with precise tool operations, leading to cognitive-load interference and unstable coordination. We present MSARL, a Multi-Small-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework that explicitly decouples reasoning from tool use. In MSARL, a Reasoning Agent decomposes problems and plans tool invocations, while multiple Tool Agents specialize in specific external tools, each trained via a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning with role-specific rewards. On mathematical problem solving with code execution, MSARL significantly improves reasoning stability and final-answer accuracy over single-agent baselines. Moreover, the architecture generalizes to diverse tool-use tasks, demonstrating that cognitive-role decoupling with small agents is a scalable blueprint for multi-agent AI design.</p></details> |  |
| **[TaoSR-SHE: Stepwise Hybrid Examination Reinforcement Learning Framework for E-commerce Search Relevance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07972v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting performance in complex inference scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and robustness.</p></details> |  |

We present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a high-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment loop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas dynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network architecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to surrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\approx 0.0004 \mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\times$ faster one-step inference. When substituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it accelerates end-to-end training by $>\!100\times$. We show that the surrogate and simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology to assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable. Our work allows to bypass the core computational bottleneck without sacrificing policy fidelity, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments across alternative climate-policy regimes with multi-gas dynamics and high-fidelity climate response.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals. Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation, which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue. In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$ score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$). Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is essential for building more reliable QA systems.

SFP constructs a novel Generative World Model to simulate diverse, high-fidelity future states, enabling an "imagination-based" environmental simulation. Within this framework, a base forecasting model acts as an agent, guided by a beam search-based planning algorithm that leverages non-differentiable domain metrics as reward signals to explore high-return future sequences. These identified high-reward candidates then serve as pseudo-labels to continuously optimize the agent's policy through iterative self-training, significantly reducing prediction error and demonstrating exceptional performance on critical domain metrics like capturing extreme events.</p></details> |  |

However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a \textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by \textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Med-R$^3$: Enhancing Medical Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning of LLMs via Progressive Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23541v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance. Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented **R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation, we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by 3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.</p></details> |  |

While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) enables these agents to learn intelligent strategies, it faces challenges of non-stationarity and partial observability. Communications among agents offer a solution, but questions remain about its optimal structure and evaluation. This paper explores two underexamined aspects: communication topology and information efficiency. We demonstrate that directed and sequential topologies improve performance while reducing communication overhead across both homogeneous and heterogeneous tasks. Additionally, we introduce two metrics -- Information Entropy Efficiency Index (IEI) and Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI) -- to evaluate message compactness and role differentiation. Incorporating these metrics into training objectives improves success rates and convergence speed. Our findings highlight that designing adaptive communication topologies with information-efficient messaging is essential for effective coordination in complex MAS.</p></details> |  |

At the heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction. Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to 1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments.

To investigate this tension, we formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position. Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning, while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and physical asymmetries between agents.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

However, these systems often exhibit sub-optimal search behaviors like over-search (retrieving redundant information) and under-search (failing to retrieve necessary information), which hinder efficiency and reliability. This work formally defines and quantifies these behaviors, revealing their prevalence across multiple QA datasets and agentic RAG systems (e.g., one model could have avoided searching in 27.7% of its search steps). Furthermore, we demonstrate a crucial link between these inefficiencies and the models' uncertainty regarding their own knowledge boundaries, where response accuracy correlates with model's uncertainty in its search decisions. To address this, we propose $\beta$-GRPO, a reinforcement learning-based training method that incorporates confidence threshold to reward high-certainty search decisions. Experiments on seven QA benchmarks show that $\beta$-GRPO enable a 3B model with better agentic RAG ability, outperforming other strong baselines with a 4% higher average exact match score.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[GCPO: When Contrast Fails, Go Gold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07790v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at: https://github.com/AchoWu/GCPO.</p></details> |  |

We propose MTR, a simulation-first training framework for tool-augmented reasoning. Instead of relying on live APIs, MTR learns from complete ReAct traces with schema-validated, simulated observations. Our approach operates through a multi-agent architecture where a ToolMaker generates task-specific, OpenAI-compatible tool interfaces, an AutoAgent produces structured think-act-observe sequences, and a ToolActor simulates realistic responses. Training proceeds in two stages: Stage-1 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) teaches 'trace grammar' from complete reasoning sequences; Stage-2 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) optimizes strategy with a composite trace reward that balances answer correctness and internal consistency. Across four multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, Bamboogle), MTR attains competitive Exact Match (EM) scores to live-API systems and excels on reasoning-intensive tasks, suggesting that effective tool reasoning can be learned from structured traces without live interactions.</p></details> |  |

In our experiments, we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained, calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline, RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 11 figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL. At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth. To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb over-confidence.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |

Existing distillation approaches train smaller students to imitate full teacher trajectories, yet reasoning and knowledge gaps between the teacher and student can cause compounding errors. We propose SCoRe, a student-centered framework in which the student generates training trajectories and the teacher corrects only the earliest error, producing training data matched to the student's ability and exposing specific weaknesses. The student is first fine-tuned on corrected trajectories. Subsequently, short-horizon reinforcement learning starts from the verified prefix preceding the earliest error, with target rewards assigned at that step. This design encourages autonomous problem-solving beyond imitation and enhances training stability. On 12 challenging benchmarks, a 7B-parameter student distilled with SCoRe matches the agentic performance of a 72B-parameter teacher.</p></details> |  |

A significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain. Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the role of long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, it often requires numerous iterations due to the lack of prior information. While recent approaches have accelerated this process by leveraging previous optimization data, collecting user data remains costly and often impractical. We present a conceptual framework, Human-in-the-Loop Optimization with Model-Informed Priors (HOMI), which augments human-in-the-loop optimization with a training phase where the optimizer learns adaptation strategies from diverse, synthetic user data generated with predictive models before deployment. To realize HOMI, we introduce Neural Acquisition Function+ (NAF+), a Bayesian optimization method featuring a neural acquisition function trained with reinforcement learning. NAF+ learns optimization strategies from large-scale synthetic data, improving efficiency in real-time optimization with users. We evaluate HOMI and NAF+ with mid-air keyboard optimization, a representative VR input task. Our work presents a new approach for more efficient interface adaptation by bridging in situ and in silico optimization processes.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality. However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has simplified this paradigm by replacing the reward and value models with rule-based verifiers. A prominent example is Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, GRPO inherently suffers from a length bias, since the same advantage is uniformly assigned to all tokens of a response. As a result, longer responses distribute the reward over more tokens and thus contribute disproportionately to gradient updates. Several variants, such as DAPO and Dr. GRPO, modify the token-level aggregation of the loss, yet these methods remain heuristic and offer limited interpretability regarding their implicit token preferences. In this work, we explore the possibility of allowing the model to learn its own token preference during optimization. We unify existing frameworks under a single formulation and introduce a learnable parameter $\lambda$ that adaptively controls token-level weighting. We use $\lambda$-GRPO to denote our method, and we find that $\lambda$-GRPO achieves consistent improvements over vanilla GRPO and DAPO on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. On Qwen2.5 models with 1.5B, 3B, and 7B parameters, $\lambda$-GRPO improves average accuracy by $+1.9\%$, $+1.0\%$, and $+1.7\%$ compared to GRPO, respectively. Importantly, these gains come without any modifications to the training data or additional computational cost, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of learning token preferences.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This limitation not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander, a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training stability and overall performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARLIN: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Murmuration Intelligence and LLM Guidance for Reservoir Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25034v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As climate change intensifies extreme weather events, water disasters pose growing threats to global communities, making adaptive reservoir management critical for protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring water security. Modern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading uncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These uncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental variability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons downstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional centralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational complexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve effective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we present MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by starling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment, separation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs to make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In addition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to adapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on real-world USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\%, cuts computation by 35\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\%, exhibiting super-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000 nodes. These results demonstrate MARLIN's potential for disaster prevention and protecting communities through intelligent, scalable water resource management.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://changyeon.site/deas</p></details> |

Advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made WebUI-to-Code increasingly feasible, yet existing benchmarks remain limited in data diversity and evaluation reliability. To address these issues, we present WebRenderBench, a large-scale benchmark of 45.1k webpages collected from real-world portal sites, offering greater diversity, complexity, and realism than prior benchmarks. We further propose a novel evaluation metric that measures layout and style consistency from the final rendered pages. Unlike vision-based methods that rely on costly LLM reasoning or structure-based comparisons vulnerable to noise and asymmetry, our approach enables more efficient, objective, and reliable UI quality assessment. Finally, we introduce the Automated Layout and Style Inspection Agent (ALISA), which integrates this metric into reinforcement learning as a reward signal to enhance training on crawled asymmetric webpages. Experiments show that ALISA significantly boosts generation performance, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality, large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenes with intricate compositions.

Signal temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step, computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics. Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for deep-RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, accepted by RTSS 2025</p></details> |

Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and auditory inputs to build and update episodic and semantic memories, gradually accumulating world knowledge. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal manner, enabling deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment. Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn reasoning and retrieves relevant memories to complete tasks. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal agents, we develop M3-Bench, a long-video question answering benchmark comprising 100 newly recorded robot-perspective videos (M3-Bench-robot) and 920 diverse web-sourced videos (M3-Bench-web). We annotate QA pairs designed to test capabilities essential for agent applications, such as person understanding, general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o, achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web and VideoMME-long, respectively.

Despite recent advancements in enhancing human-computer interaction within database applications, significant challenges persist, particularly regarding the reasoning performance in complex scenarios involving multi-table joins and nested queries. Current methodologies primarily utilize supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) to train the NL2SQL model, which may limit adaptability and interpretability in new environments~(e.g., finance and healthcare). In order to enhance the reasoning performance of the NL2SQL model in the above complex situations, we introduce SQL-R1, a novel NL2SQL reasoning model trained by the reinforcement learning~(RL) algorithms. We design a specialized RL-based reward function tailored for NL2SQL tasks and discussed the impact of cold start and synthetic data on the effectiveness of intensive training. In addition, we achieve competitive accuracy using only a tiny amount of synthetic NL2SQL data for augmented training and further explore data engineering for RL.

In these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion. Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function calling.</p></details> |  |

However, many KG-RAG systems compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding), inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B, KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models. Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment.

First, we address computational cost by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning, causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial performance in live, interactive settings.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[XRPO: Pushing the limits of GRPO with Targeted Exploration and Exploitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06672v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO have driven recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning. While scaling the number of rollouts stabilizes training, existing approaches suffer from limited exploration on challenging prompts and leave informative feedback signals underexploited, due to context-independent rollout allocation across prompts (e.g., generating 16 rollouts per prompt) and relying heavily on sparse rewards. This paper presents XRPO(eXplore - eXploit GRPO), a unified framework that recasts policy optimization through the principled lens of rollout exploration-exploitation. To enhance exploration, XRPO introduces a mathematically grounded rollout allocator that adaptively prioritizes prompts with higher potential for uncertainty reduction. It further addresses stagnation on zero-reward prompts through an in-context seeding strategy that injects curated exemplars, steering the model into more difficult reasoning trajectories. To strengthen exploitation, XRPO develops a group-relative, novelty-aware advantage sharpening mechanism that leverages sequence likelihoods to amplify low-probability yet correct responses, thereby extending the policy's reach beyond sparse rewards. Experiments across diverse math and coding benchmarks on both reasoning and non-reasoning models demonstrate that XRPO outperforms existing advances (e.g., GRPO and GSPO) up to 4% pass@1 and 6% cons@32, while accelerating training convergence by up to 2.7X.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07650v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles, such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern, flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method (Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings. Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in success rates.

| **[Intention-Conditioned Flow Occupancy Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08902v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning research is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can be used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute resources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific tasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing because it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL, including sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a fundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions have long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across time is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for modeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic model to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant future (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are often constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include in our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention increases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with generalized policy improvement. We call our proposed method intention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative methods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$ image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8 \times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\%$.

| **[From Data to Rewards: a Bilevel Optimization Perspective on Maximum Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07624v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models form the backbone of modern machine learning, underpinning state-of-the-art systems in text, vision, and multimodal applications. While Maximum Likelihood Estimation has traditionally served as the dominant training paradigm, recent work have highlighted its limitations, particularly in generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting compared to Reinforcement Learning techniques, such as Policy Gradient methods. However, these approaches depend on explicit reward signals, which are often unavailable in practice, leaving open the fundamental problem of how to align generative models when only high-quality datasets are accessible. In this work, we address this challenge via a Bilevel Optimization framework, where the reward function is treated as the optimization variable of an outer-level problem, while a policy gradient objective defines the inner-level. We then conduct a theoretical analysis of this optimization problem in a tractable setting and extract insights that, as we demonstrate, generalize to applications such as tabular classification and model-based reinforcement learning. We release the code at https://github.com/abenechehab/nll_to_po .</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniRetarget: Interaction-Preserving Data Generation for Humanoid Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation and Scene Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26633v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly, common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints, OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover, preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30 seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks, without any learning curriculum.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://omniretarget.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Difference Predictive Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20141v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting and reasoning about the future lie at the heart of many time-series questions. For example, goal-conditioned reinforcement learning can be viewed as learning representations to predict which states are likely to be visited in the future. While prior methods have used contrastive predictive coding to model time series data, learning representations that encode long-term dependencies usually requires large amounts of data. In this paper, we introduce a temporal difference version of contrastive predictive coding that stitches together pieces of different time series data to decrease the amount of data required to learn predictions of future events. We apply this representation learning method to derive an off-policy algorithm for goal-conditioned RL. Experiments demonstrate that, compared with prior RL methods, ours achieves $2 \times$ median improvement in success rates and can better cope with stochastic environments. In tabular settings, we show that our method is about $20 \times$ more sample efficient than the successor representation and $1500 \times$ more sample efficient than the standard (Monte Carlo) version of contrastive predictive coding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024.

| **[AgentAsk: Multi-Agent Systems Need to Ask](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07593v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However, they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Reasoning Models Self-Train?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21444v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent successes of reinforcement learning (RL) in training large reasoning models motivate the question of whether self-training - the process where a model learns from its own judgments - can be sustained within RL. In this work, we study this question using majority voting as a simple self-feedback mechanism. On a comprehensive set of experiments on both synthetic and real reasoning tasks, we find that this basic approach improves not only the model's reasoning performance, but also its capability of generating better quality feedback for the next RL iteration, driving further model improvement. Yet our analysis also reveals a critical limitation of such a self-training paradigm - prolonged RL with self-reward leads to reward hacking where models learn to maximize training (pseudo-)reward, resulting in sudden and complete performance collapse. Together, these results highlight feedback design as the central challenge and call for future research on mechanisms to enable prolonged self-improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://self-rewarding-llm-training.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Expanding the Action Space of LLMs to Reason Beyond Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07581v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed, and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time. From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm competitive with classical designs.</p></details> |  |

Training effective web agents for multi-turn interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of long-horizon decision-making across dynamic web interfaces. In this work, we present WebAgent-R1, a simple yet effective end-to-end multi-turn RL framework for training web agents. It learns directly from online interactions with web environments by asynchronously generating diverse trajectories, entirely guided by binary rewards depending on task success. Experiments on the WebArena-Lite benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of WebAgent-R1, boosting the task success rate of Qwen-2.5-3B from 6.1% to 33.9% and Llama-3.1-8B from 8.5% to 44.8%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and strong proprietary models such as OpenAI o3. In-depth analyses reveal the effectiveness of the thinking-based prompting strategy and test-time scaling through increased interactions for web tasks. We further investigate different RL initialization policies by introducing two variants, namely WebAgent-R1-Zero and WebAgent-R1-CoT, which highlight the importance of the warm-up training stage (i.e., behavior cloning) and provide insights on incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in web agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025.

| **[Let's Reason Formally: Natural-Formal Hybrid Reasoning Enhances LLM's Math Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23703v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning (NFL-HR)**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the NL-FL Problem Alignment method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the Mixed Problem Input technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based Answer Extraction mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the NFL-HR framework achieves **89.80**% and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by **4.60%** and **4.82%**, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.</p></details> |  |

However, wearables are still facing several challenges. Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context, task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, Under review in the IEEE Internet of Things Journal</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning by Exploration: A Unified Approach to Retrieval and Generation over Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07484v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning over structured graphs remains a fundamental challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly when scaling to large graphs. Existing approaches typically follow the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm: first retrieving subgraphs relevant to the query and then generating answers conditioned on the retrieved subgraphs. However, such two-phase pipelines often struggle to faithfully incorporate graph structure, since the generation process is ultimately constrained by the quality and completeness of the retrieved subgraph. Although many advanced retrievers have been proposed recently to mitigate this issue, they are usually tailored to the training graphs and generalize poorly to unseen graphs, which limits their practical applicability. In this work, we propose Reasoning by Exploration (RoE), a novel approach that unifies retrieval and generation by framing reasoning over graphs as a process of graph exploration. At each step, the LLM selects candidate nodes and edges to explore, gradually constructing reasoning paths and generating answers along the way. To enable effective exploration, RoE is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on gold reasoning paths, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance exploration effectiveness and generalization. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RoE achieves substantial overall improvements over baselines, while also generalizing effectively to unseen graphs.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has explored handheld paradigms, their rod-based mechanical structures remain rigid and unintuitive, providing limited tactile feedback and posing challenges for human operators. Motivated by the dexterity and force feedback of human motion, we propose FreeTacMan, a human-centric and robot-free data collection system for accurate and efficient robot manipulation. Concretely, we design a wearable gripper with dual visuo-tactile sensors for data collection, which can be worn by human fingers for intuitive control. A high-precision optical tracking system is introduced to capture end-effector poses while synchronizing visual and tactile feedback simultaneously. We leverage FreeTacMan to collect a large-scale multimodal dataset, comprising over 3000k paired visual-tactile images with end-effector poses, 10k demonstration trajectories across 50 diverse contact-rich manipulation tasks. FreeTacMan achieves multiple improvements in data collection performance compared to prior works, and enables effective policy learning for contact-rich manipulation tasks with self-collected dataset. The full suite of hardware specifications and the dataset will be released to facilitate reproducibility and support research in visuo-tactile manipulation.</p></details> |  |

This artwork, Airy, asks whether complex multi agent AI can become intuitively understandable by staging a competition between two reinforcement trained robot arms that snap a bedsheet skyward. Building on three design principles, competition as a clear metric (who lifts higher), embodied familiarity (audiences recognize fabric snapping), and sensor to sense mapping (robot cooperation or rivalry shown through forest and weather projections), the installation gives viewers a visceral way to read machine intent. Observations from five international exhibitions indicate that audiences consistently read the robots' strategies, conflict, and cooperation in real time, with emotional reactions that mirror the system's internal state. The project shows how sensory metaphors can turn a black box into a public interface.</p></details> |  |

Yet, LLM-powered conversational robots remain prone to errors, e.g., misunderstanding user intent, prematurely interrupting users, or failing to respond altogether. Detecting and addressing these failures is critical for preventing conversational breakdowns, avoiding task disruptions, and sustaining user trust. To tackle this problem, the ERR@HRI 2.0 Challenge provides a multimodal dataset of LLM-powered conversational robot failures during human-robot conversations and encourages researchers to benchmark machine learning models designed to detect robot failures. The dataset includes 16 hours of dyadic human-robot interactions, incorporating facial, speech, and head movement features. Each interaction is annotated with the presence or absence of robot errors from the system perspective, and perceived user intention to correct for a mismatch between robot behavior and user expectation. Participants are invited to form teams and develop machine learning models that detect these failures using multimodal data. Submissions will be evaluated using various performance metrics, including detection accuracy and false positive rate. This challenge represents another key step toward improving failure detection in human-robot interaction through social signal analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[FG-PE: Factor-graph Approach for Multi-robot Pursuit-Evasion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00741v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing use of robots in daily life, there is a growing need to provide robust collaboration protocols for robots to tackle more complicated and dynamic problems effectively. This paper presents a novel, factor graph-based approach to address the pursuit-evasion problem, enabling accurate estimation, planning, and tracking of an evader by multiple pursuers working together. It is assumed that there are multiple pursuers and only one evader in this scenario. The proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of evader estimation and tracking, allowing pursuers to capture the evader in the shortest possible time and distance compared to existing techniques. In addition to these primary objectives, the proposed approach effectively minimizes uncertainty while remaining robust, even when communication issues lead to some messages being dropped or lost. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, this paper demonstrates that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms traditional pursuit-evasion methods across several key performance metrics, such as the time required to capture the evader and the average distance traveled by the pursuers. Additionally, the proposed method is tested in real-world hardware experiments, further validating its effectiveness and applicability.</p></details> |  |

A comparative analysis is conducted between classical PID controllers and modern reinforcement learning algorithms, including Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). The results demonstrate that TRPO outperforms other methods, achieving the lowest root mean square (RMS) errors across various trajectories and exhibiting robustness to larger time intervals between control updates. TRPO's ability to balance exploration and exploitation enables stable control in noisy, real-world environments, reducing reliance on high-frequency sensor feedback and computational demands. These findings highlight TRPO's potential as a robust solution for complex robotic control tasks, with implications for dynamic environments and future applications in sensor fusion or hybrid control strategies.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches fail to leverage metric cues from depth sensors and camera calibration, instead reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition tasks that cannot deliver the centimeter-level accuracy essential for robotic manipulation. We present TIGeR (Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning), a novel framework that transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric computers by enabling them to generate and execute precise geometric computations through external tools. Rather than attempting to internalize complex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to recognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate computational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To support this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive tool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose estimation, and spatial compatibility verification, complete with tool invocation sequences and intermediate computations. Through a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with our proposed hierarchical reward design, TIGeR achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks while demonstrating centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

The ultimate goal is to discover routine-type models to enable robotic process automation. The discovery of routine-type models requires the provision of a routine log. Unfortunately, the vast majority of existing works do not directly focus on enabling the model discovery, limiting themselves to extracting the set of actions that are part of the routines. They were also not evaluated in scenarios characterized by inconsistent routine execution, hereafter referred to as noise, which reflects natural variability and occasional errors in human performance. This paper presents a clustering-based technique that aims to extract routine logs. Experiments were conducted on nine UI logs from the literature with different levels of injected noise. Our technique was compared with existing techniques, most of which are not meant to discover routine logs but were adapted for the purpose. The results were evaluated through standard state-of-the-art metrics, showing that we can extract more accurate routine logs than what the state of the art could, especially in the presence of noise.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

While ultrasound is the first-line diagnostic tool, liver sonography requires locating multiple non-continuous planes from positions where target structures are often not visible, for biometric assessment and lesion detection, requiring significant expertise. However, expert sonographers are severely scarce in resource-limited regions. Here, we develop an autonomous lightweight ultrasound robot comprising an AI agent that integrates multi-modal perception with memory attention for localization of unseen target structures, and a 588-gram 6-degrees-of-freedom cable-driven robot. By mounting on the abdomen, the system enhances robustness against motion. Our robot can autonomously acquire expert-level standard liver ultrasound planes and detect pathology in patients, including two from Xining, a 2261-meter-altitude city with limited medical resources. Our system performs effectively on rapid-motion individuals and in wilderness environments. This work represents the first demonstration of autonomous sonography across multiple challenging scenarios, potentially transforming access to expert-level diagnostics in underserved regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reliable LLM-based Robot Planning via Combined Uncertainty Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08044v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced reasoning abilities, enabling robots to understand natural language instructions and generate high-level plans with appropriate grounding. However, LLM hallucinations present a significant challenge, often leading to overconfident yet potentially misaligned or unsafe plans. While researchers have explored uncertainty estimation to improve the reliability of LLM-based planning, existing studies have not sufficiently differentiated between epistemic and intrinsic uncertainty, limiting the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we present Combined Uncertainty estimation for Reliable Embodied planning (CURE), which decomposes the uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic uncertainty, each estimated separately. Furthermore, epistemic uncertainty is subdivided into task clarity and task familiarity for more accurate evaluation. The overall uncertainty assessments are obtained using random network distillation and multi-layer perceptron regression heads driven by LLM features. We validated our approach in two distinct experimental settings: kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement experiments. The results show that, compared to existing methods, our approach yields uncertainty estimates that are more closely aligned with the actual execution outcomes.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Proprioception-Aware Embodied Planning for Dual-Arm Humanoid Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07882v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated the ability to serve as high-level planners, enabling robots to follow complex human instructions. However, their effectiveness, especially in long-horizon tasks involving dual-arm humanoid robots, remains limited. This limitation arises from two main challenges: (i) the absence of simulation platforms that systematically support task evaluation and data collection for humanoid robots, and (ii) the insufficient embodiment awareness of current MLLMs, which hinders reasoning about dual-arm selection logic and body positions during planning. To address these issues, we present DualTHOR, a new dual-arm humanoid simulator, with continuous transition and a contingency mechanism. Building on this platform, we propose Proprio-MLLM, a model that enhances embodiment awareness by incorporating proprioceptive information with motion-based position embedding and a cross-spatial encoder. Experiments show that, while existing MLLMs struggle in this environment, Proprio-MLLM achieves an average improvement of 19.75% in planning performance. Our work provides both an essential simulation platform and an effective model to advance embodied intelligence in humanoid robotics. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DualTHOR-5F3B.</p></details> |  |

Although data-driven approaches have advanced embodied intelligence in terrestrial robots and enabled task-specific autonomous underwater robots, developing underwater intelligence capable of autonomously performing multiple tasks remains highly challenging, as large-scale, high-quality underwater datasets are still scarce. To address these limitations, we introduce USIM, a simulation-based multi-task Vision-Language-Action (VLA) dataset for underwater robots. USIM comprises over 561K frames from 1,852 trajectories, totaling approximately 15.6 hours of BlueROV2 interactions across 20 tasks in 9 diverse scenarios, ranging from visual navigation to mobile manipulation. Building upon this dataset, we propose U0, a VLA model for general underwater robots, which integrates binocular vision and other sensor modalities through multimodal fusion, and further incorporates a convolution-attention-based perception focus enhancement module (CAP) to improve spatial understanding and mobile manipulation. Across tasks such as inspection, obstacle avoidance, scanning, and dynamic tracking, the framework achieves a success rate of 80%, while in challenging mobile manipulation tasks, it reduces the distance to the target by 21.2% compared with baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. USIM and U0 show that VLA models can be effectively applied to underwater robotic applications, providing a foundation for scalable dataset construction, improved task autonomy, and the practical realization of intelligent general underwater robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[DM1: MeanFlow with Dispersive Regularization for 1-Step Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07865v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to learn multi-modal action distributions is indispensable for robotic manipulation policies to perform precise and robust control. Flow-based generative models have recently emerged as a promising solution to learning distributions of actions, offering one-step action generation and thus achieving much higher sampling efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods. However, existing flow-based policies suffer from representation collapse, the inability to distinguish similar visual representations, leading to failures in precise manipulation tasks. We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive Regularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching framework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent collapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive regularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers, encouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing additional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on RoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s vs. 2-3.5s) and improves success rates by 10-20 percentage points, with the Lift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline. Real-robot deployment on a Franka Panda further validates that DM1 transfers effectively from simulation to the physical world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage representation regularization to enable flow-based policies to achieve strong performance in robotic manipulation, establishing a simple yet powerful approach for efficient and robust manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website with code: https://guowei-zou.github.io/dm1/</p></details> |
| **[IntentionVLA: Generalizable and Efficient Embodied Intention Reasoning for Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07778v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions. Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning, endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, deploying such high-stakes systems in real-world scenarios poses significant challenges when the stakeholders, such as engineers and legislative bodies, lack insights into the neural networks' decision-making process. Presently, explainable AI is primarily tailored to natural language processing and computer vision, falling short in two critical aspects when applied in robots: grounding in decision-making tasks and the ability to assess trustworthiness of their explanations. In this paper, we introduce a trustworthy explainable robotics technique based on human-interpretable, high-level concepts that attribute to the decisions made by the neural network. Our proposed technique provides explanations with associated uncertainty scores for the explanation by matching neural network's activations with human-interpretable visualizations. To validate our approach, we conducted a series of experiments with various simulated and real-world robot decision-making models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach as a post-hoc, human-friendly robot diagnostic tool.</p></details> | 19 pages, 26 figures |
| **[Estimating Dynamic Soft Continuum Robot States From Boundaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04491v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation is one of the fundamental problems in robotics. For soft continuum robots, this task is particularly challenging because their states (poses, strains, internal wrenches, and velocities) are inherently infinite-dimensional functions due to their continuous deformability. Traditional sensing techniques, however, can only provide discrete measurements. Recently, a dynamic state estimation method known as a \textit{boundary observer} was introduced, which uses Cosserat rod theory to recover all infinite-dimensional states by measuring only the tip velocity. In this work, we present a dual design that instead relies on measuring the internal wrench at the robot's base. Despite the duality, this new approach offers a key practical advantage: it requires only a force/torque (FT) sensor embedded at the base and eliminates the need for external motion capture systems. Both observer types are inspired by principles of energy dissipation and can be naturally combined to enhance performance. We conduct a Lyapunov-based analysis to study the convergence rate of these boundary observers and reveal a useful property: as the observer gains increase, the convergence rate initially improves and then degrades. This convex trend enables efficient tuning of the observer gains. We also identify special cases where linear and angular states are fully determined by each other, which further relaxes sensing requirements. Experimental studies using a tendon-driven continuum robot validate the convergence of all observer variants under fast dynamic motions, the existence of optimal gains, robustness against unknown external forces, and the algorithm's real-time computational performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLEET: Formal Language-Grounded Scheduling for Heterogeneous Robot Teams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07417v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating heterogeneous robot teams from free-form natural-language instructions is hard. Language-only planners struggle with long-horizon coordination and hallucination, while purely formal methods require closed-world models. We present FLEET, a hybrid decentralized framework that turns language into optimized multi-robot schedules. An LLM front-end produces (i) a task graph with durations and precedence and (ii) a capability-aware robot--task fitness matrix; a formal back-end solves a makespan-minimization problem while the underlying robots execute their free-form subtasks with agentic closed-loop control. Across multiple free-form language-guided autonomy coordination benchmarks, FLEET improves success over state of the art generative planners on two-agent teams across heterogeneous tasks. Ablations show that mixed integer linear programming (MILP) primarily improves temporal structure, while LLM-derived fitness is decisive for capability-coupled tasks; together they deliver the highest overall performance. We demonstrate the translation to real world challenges with hardware trials using a pair of quadruped robots with disjoint capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[M^3RS: Multi-robot, Multi-objective, and Multi-mode Routing and Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16275v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task execution quality significantly impacts multi-robot missions, yet existing task allocation frameworks rarely consider quality of service as a decision variable, despite its importance in applications like robotic disinfection and cleaning. We introduce the multi-robot, multi-objective, and multi-mode routing and scheduling (M3RS) problem, designed for time-constrained missions. In M3RS, each task offers multiple execution modes with varying resource needs, durations, and quality levels, allowing trade-offs across mission objectives. M3RS is modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) problem and optimizes task sequencing and execution modes for each agent. We apply M3RS to multi-robot disinfection in healthcare and public spaces, optimizing disinfection quality and task completion rates. Through synthetic case studies, M3RS demonstrates 3-46$\%$ performance improvements over the standard task allocation method across various metrics. Further, to improve compute time, we propose a clustering-based column generation algorithm that achieves solutions comparable to or better than the baseline MIP solver while reducing computation time by 60$\%$. We also conduct case studies with simulated and real robots.

| **[Interleave-VLA: Enhancing Robot Manipulation with Interleaved Image-Text Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02152v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of foundation models paves the way for generalist robot policies in the physical world. Existing methods relying on text-only instructions often struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. We argue that interleaved image-text inputs offer richer and less biased context and enable robots to better handle unseen tasks with more versatile human-robot interaction. Building on this insight, Interleave-VLA, the first robot learning paradigm capable of comprehending interleaved image-text instructions and directly generating continuous action sequences in the physical world, is introduced. It offers a natural, flexible, and model-agnostic paradigm that extends state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) models with minimal modifications while achieving strong zero-shot generalization. Interleave-VLA also includes an automatic pipeline that converts text instructions from Open X-Embodiment into interleaved image-text instructions, resulting in a large-scale real-world interleaved embodied dataset with 210k episodes. Comprehensive evaluation in simulation and the real world shows that Interleave-VLA offers two major benefits: (1) improves out-of-domain generalization to unseen objects by 2x compared to text input baselines, (2) supports flexible task interfaces and diverse instructions in a zero-shot manner, such as hand-drawn sketches. We attribute Interleave-VLA's strong zero-shot capability to the use of instruction images, which effectively mitigate hallucinations, and the inclusion of heterogeneous multimodal datasets, enriched with Internet-sourced images, offering potential for scalability.

By unifying vision, language, and action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects, embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition, architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms, data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying VLAs to real-world robotic systems.

Eight artists engaged in six painting sessions -- three with a human partner, followed by three with the robot -- and subsequently participated in semi-structured interviews analyzed through reflexive thematic analysis. Human-human interactions were described as intuitive, dialogic, and emotionally engaging, whereas human-robot sessions felt more playful and reflective, offering greater autonomy and prompting for novel strategies to overcome the system's limitations.

| **[Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy for Long-horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10040v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have advanced robot imitation learning, but high data collection costs and limited demonstrations hinder generalization and current imitation learning methods struggle in out-of-distribution scenarios, especially for long-horizon tasks. A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)</p></details> |

Kirigami structures, characterized by their bending-dominated deformation, offer resilience to tensile forces and facilitate shape morphing under small actuation forces. Kirigami components such as actuators, sensors, batteries, controllers, and body structures can be tailored to specific robotic applications by optimizing cut patterns. Actuators based on kirigami principles exhibit complex motions programmable through various energy sources, while kirigami sensors bridge the gap between electrical conductivity and compliance. Kirigami-integrated batteries enable energy storage directly within robot structures, enhancing flexibility and compactness. Kirigami-controlled mechanisms mimic mechanical computations, enabling advanced functionalities such as shape morphing and memory functions. Applications of kirigami-enabled robots include grasping, locomotion, and wearables, showcasing their adaptability to diverse environments and tasks. Despite promising opportunities, challenges remain in the design of cut patterns for a given function and streamlining fabrication techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Touch Speaks, Sound Feels: A Multimodal Approach to Affective and Social Touch from Robots to Humans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07839v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Affective tactile interaction constitutes a fundamental component of human communication. In natural human-human encounters, touch is seldom experienced in isolation; rather, it is inherently multisensory. Individuals not only perceive the physical sensation of touch but also register the accompanying auditory cues generated through contact. The integration of haptic and auditory information forms a rich and nuanced channel for emotional expression. While extensive research has examined how robots convey emotions through facial expressions and speech, their capacity to communicate social gestures and emotions via touch remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we developed a multimodal interaction system incorporating a 5*5 grid of 25 vibration motors synchronized with audio playback, enabling robots to deliver combined haptic-audio stimuli. In an experiment involving 32 Chinese participants, ten emotions and six social gestures were presented through vibration, sound, or their combination. Participants rated each stimulus on arousal and valence scales. The results revealed that (1) the combined haptic-audio modality significantly enhanced decoding accuracy compared to single modalities; (2) each individual channel-vibration or sound-effectively supported certain emotions recognition, with distinct advantages depending on the emotional expression; and (3) gestures alone were generally insufficient for conveying clearly distinguishable emotions. These findings underscore the importance of multisensory integration in affective human-robot interaction and highlight the complementary roles of haptic and auditory cues in enhancing emotional communication.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods relying on preplanned recovery motions, simplified dynamics or sparse rewards often fail to produce robust recovery policies. This paper presents a learning-based framework integrating Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping and curriculum learning, which dynamically balances exploration of diverse recovery maneuvers with precise posture refinement. An asymmetric actor-critic architecture accelerates training by leveraging privileged information in simulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against uncertainties. We further demonstrate that synergistic wheel-leg coordination reduces joint torque consumption by 15.8% and 26.2% and improves stabilization through energy transfer mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on two distinct quadruped platforms achieve recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8% without platform-specific tuning.

Traditional robot control methods often require users to adapt to interfaces or memorize predefined commands, limiting usability in dynamic, unstructured environments. This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as person tracking and hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the system, a series of real-world experiments was conducted across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical in real-world scenarios, with an average cognition-to-execution accuracy of approximately 94%, making a significant contribution to HRI systems and robots.

| **[Control of Humanoid Robots with Parallel Mechanisms using Differential Actuation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22459v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several recently released humanoid robots, inspired by the mechanical design of Cassie, employ actuator configurations in which the motors are displaced from the joints to reduce leg inertia. While studies accounting for the full kinematic complexity have demonstrated the benefits of these designs, the associated loop-closure constraints greatly increase computational cost and limit their use in control and learning. As a result, the non-linear transmission is often approximated by a constant reduction ratio, preventing exploitation of the mechanism's full capabilities. This paper introduces a compact analytical formulation for the two standard knee and ankle mechanisms that captures the exact non-linear transmission while remaining computationally efficient. The model is fully differentiable up to second order with a minimal formulation, enabling low-cost evaluation of dynamic derivatives for trajectory optimization and of the apparent transmission impedance for reinforcement learning. We integrate this formulation into trajectory optimization and locomotion policy learning, and compare it against simplified constant-ratio approaches. Hardware experiments demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness, showing that the proposed method provides a practical means to incorporate parallel actuation into modern control algorithms.</p></details> |  |

This one-size-fits-all approach undermines autonomy, accelerates dependence, and increases caregiver burden. Occupational therapy principles emphasize matching assistance levels to individual capabilities: minimal reminders for those who merely forget, spatial guidance for those who misplace items, and comprehensive multimodal support for those requiring step-by-step instruction. However, existing robotic systems lack this adaptive, graduated response framework essential for maintaining PLWD independence. We present an adaptive multimodal robotic framework using the Pepper robot that dynamically adjusts assistance based on real-time assessment of user needs. Our system implements a hierarchical intervention model progressing from (1) simple verbal reminders, to (2) verbal + gestural cues, to (3) full multimodal guidance combining physical navigation to medication locations with step-by-step verbal and gestural instructions. Powered by LLM-driven interaction strategies and multimodal sensing, the system continuously evaluates task states to provide just-enough assistance-preserving autonomy while ensuring medication adherence. We conducted a preliminary study with healthy adults and dementia care stakeholders in a controlled lab setting, evaluating the system's usability, comprehensibility, and appropriateness of adaptive feedback mechanisms. This work contributes: (1) a theoretically grounded adaptive assistance framework translating occupational therapy principles into HRI design, (2) a multimodal robotic implementation that preserves PLWD dignity through graduated support, and (3) empirical insights into stakeholder perceptions of adaptive robotic care.</p></details> |  |

Although classical navigation methods provide interpretability, they rely heavily on expert manual tuning, limiting their adaptability. Conversely, purely learning-based methods offer adaptability but often lead to instability and erratic robot behaviors. Recently introduced parameter tuners aim to balance these approaches by integrating data-driven adaptability into classical navigation frameworks. However, the parameter tuning process currently suffers from training inefficiencies and redundant sampling, with critical regions in environment often underrepresented in training data. In this paper, we propose EffiTune, a novel framework designed to diagnose and mitigate training inefficiency for parameter tuners in robot navigation systems. EffiTune first performs robot-behavior-guided diagnostics to pinpoint critical bottlenecks and underrepresented regions. It then employs a targeted up-sampling strategy to enrich the training dataset with critical samples, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing training efficiency. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that EffiTune achieves more than a 13.5% improvement in navigation performance, enhanced robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a 4x improvement in training efficiency within the same computational budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

These materials pose a unique problem for traditional perception systems because they lack discernible features and can cause conventional depth sensors to fail, leading to inaccurate maps and potential collisions. To ensure safe navigation, robots must be able to accurately detect and map these transparent obstacles. Existing methods often rely on large, expensive sensors or algorithms that impose high computational burdens, making them unsuitable for low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) robots. In this work, we propose a novel and computationally efficient framework for detecting and mapping transparent obstacles onboard a sub-300g quadrotor. Our method fuses data from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera and an ultrasonic sensor with a custom, lightweight 2D convolution model. This specialized approach accurately detects specular reflections and propagates their depth into corresponding empty regions of the depth map, effectively rendering transparent obstacles visible. The entire pipeline operates in real-time, utilizing only a small fraction of a CPU core on an embedded processor. We validate our system through a series of experiments in both controlled and real-world environments, demonstrating the utility of our method through experiments where the robot maps indoor environments containing glass. Our work is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind to demonstrate a real-time, onboard transparent obstacle mapping system on a low-SWaP quadrotor using only the CPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |

Moving beyond textual or visual speculation, our ``dinner-in-the-drama'' combined performance, ritual, and multisensory immersion to provoke reflection on sustainability, ethics, and cultural identity. Six participants from creative industries engaged as diners and role-players, responding with curiosity, discomfort, and philosophical debate. They imagined biohybrids as both plausible and unsettling -- raising questions of sentience, symbolism, and technology adoption that exceed conventional sustainability framings of synthetic meat. Our contributions to HCI are threefold: (i) a speculative artifact that stages robots as food, (ii) empirical insights into how publics negotiate cultural and ethical boundaries in post-natural eating, and (iii) a methodological advance in embodied, multisensory design fiction.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present DYMO-Hair, a model-based robot hair care system. We introduce a novel dynamics learning paradigm that is suited for volumetric quantities such as hair, relying on an action-conditioned latent state editing mechanism, coupled with a compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles to improve generalizability. This latent space is pre-trained at scale using a novel hair physics simulator, enabling generalization across previously unseen hairstyles. Using the dynamics model with a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) planner, DYMO-Hair is able to perform visual goal-conditioned hair styling. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that DYMO-Hair's dynamics model outperforms baselines on capturing local deformation for diverse, unseen hairstyles. DYMO-Hair further outperforms baselines in closed-loop hair styling tasks on unseen hairstyles, with an average of 22% lower final geometric error and 42% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art system. Real-world experiments exhibit zero-shot transferability of our system to wigs, achieving consistent success on challenging unseen hairstyles where the state-of-the-art system fails. Together, these results introduce a foundation for model-based robot hair care, advancing toward more generalizable, flexible, and accessible robot hair styling in unconstrained physical environments.

In this work, we present and validate a vision-guided robotic framework that uses data from an end-effector mounted RGB-D sensor and combines 3D plant reconstruction, targeted grasp planning, and physics-based vibration modeling to enable precise pollination. First, the plant is reconstructed in 3D and registered to the robot coordinate frame to identify obstacle-free grasp poses along the main stem. Second, a discrete elastic rod model predicts the relationship between actuation parameters and flower dynamics, guiding the selection of optimal pollination strategies. Finally, a manipulator with soft grippers grasps the stem and applies controlled vibrations to induce pollen release. End-to-end experiments demonstrate a 92.5\% main-stem grasping success rate, and simulation-guided optimization of vibration parameters further validates the feasibility of our approach, ensuring that the robot can safely and effectively perform pollination without damaging the flower. To our knowledge, this is the first robotic system to jointly integrate vision-based grasping and vibration modeling for automated precision pollination.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Autonomous Tape Handling for Robotic Wound Redressing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06127v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chronic wounds, such as diabetic, pressure, and venous ulcers, affect over 6.5 million patients in the United States alone and generate an annual cost exceeding \$25 billion. Despite this burden, chronic wound care remains a routine yet manual process performed exclusively by trained clinicians due to its critical safety demands. We envision a future in which robotics and automation support wound care to lower costs and enhance patient outcomes. This paper introduces an autonomous framework for one of the most fundamental yet challenging subtasks in wound redressing: adhesive tape manipulation. Specifically, we address two critical capabilities: tape initial detachment (TID) and secure tape placement. To handle the complex adhesive dynamics of detachment, we propose a force-feedback imitation learning approach trained from human teleoperation demonstrations. For tape placement, we develop a numerical trajectory optimization method based to ensure smooth adhesion and wrinkle-free application across diverse anatomical surfaces. We validate these methods through extensive experiments, demonstrating reliable performance in both quantitative evaluations and integrated wound redressing pipelines. Our results establish tape manipulation as an essential step toward practical robotic wound care automation.</p></details> |  |

For this problem class, conventional optimizers suffer from small step sizes and slow convergence. We propose BC-ADMM, a variant of Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM), that can solve a class of non-convex constrained optimizations with biconvex constraint relaxation. Our algorithm allows larger step sizes by breaking the problem into small-scale sub-problems that can be easily solved in parallel. We show that our method has both theoretical convergence speed guarantees and practical convergence guarantees in the asymptotic sense. Through numerical experiments in a row of four robotic applications, we show that BC-ADMM has faster convergence than conventional gradient descent and Newton's method in terms of wall clock time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Dynamic Control of Tendon-driven Continuum Robots using Clarke Transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20693v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a dynamic model and control framework for tendon-driven continuum robots (TDCRs) with multiple segments and an arbitrary number of tendons per segment. Our approach leverages the Clarke transform, the Euler-Lagrange formalism, and the piecewise constant curvature assumption to formulate a dynamic model on a two-dimensional manifold embedded in the joint space that inherently satisfies tendon constraints. We present linear and constraint-informed controllers that operate directly on this manifold, along with practical methods for preventing negative tendon forces without compromising control fidelity. This opens up new design possibilities for overactuated TDCRs with improved force distribution and stiffness without increasing controller complexity. We validate these approaches in simulation and on a physical prototype with one segment and five tendons, demonstrating accurate dynamic behavior and robust trajectory tracking under real-time conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025), 8 pages, and 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Robot Distributed Optimization for Exploration and Mapping of Unknown Environments using Bioinspired Tactile-Sensor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06085v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This project proposes a bioinspired multi-robot system using Distributed Optimization for efficient exploration and mapping of unknown environments. Each robot explores its environment and creates a map, which is afterwards put together to form a global 2D map of the environment. Inspired by wall-following behaviors, each robot autonomously explores its neighborhood based on a tactile sensor, similar to the antenna of a cockroach, mounted on the surface of the robot. Instead of avoiding obstacles, robots log collision points when they touch obstacles. This decentralized control strategy ensures effective task allocation and efficient exploration of unknown terrains, with applications in search and rescue, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. The approach was validated through experiments using e-puck robots in a simulated 1.5 x 1.5 m environment with three obstacles. The results demonstrated the system's effectiveness in achieving high coverage, minimizing collisions, and constructing accurate 2D maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Model Matching for Remotely Controlled Differential Drive Robotic Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06081v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of regulation of the orientation angle of a remotely controlled differential-drive mobile robot with actuator dynamics and network-induced delays is studied. Using a preinstalled two-layer nonlinear control scheme that decouples linear and angular velocities and regulates heading, a third, delay-dependent layer that achieves exact model matching from the orientation angle command to the orientation angle is introduced. The proposed outer loop controller is a delay dependent dynamic measurable output-feedback controller with dynamic proper precompensator. Parameterization yields a simple characteristic quasi-polynomial with coefficients constrained to satisfy stability for all delays up to a computable bound. Computational experiments confirm accurate tracking, fast settling and bounded internal signals and control voltages. The approach offers an analytic design alternative to AI-based tuning for delayed robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments, with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.</p></details> | IEEE CAI 2025 |
| **[CottonSim: A vision-guided autonomous robotic system for cotton harvesting in Gazebo simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05317v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cotton is a major cash crop in the United States, with the country being a leading global producer and exporter. Nearly all U.S. cotton is grown in the Cotton Belt, spanning 17 states in the southern region. Harvesting remains a critical yet challenging stage, impacted by the use of costly, environmentally harmful defoliants and heavy, expensive cotton pickers. These factors contribute to yield loss, reduced fiber quality, and soil compaction, which collectively threaten long-term sustainability. To address these issues, this study proposes a lightweight, small-scale, vision-guided autonomous robotic cotton picker as an alternative. An autonomous system, built on Clearpath's Husky platform and integrated with the CottonEye perception system, was developed and tested in the Gazebo simulation environment. A virtual cotton field was designed to facilitate autonomous navigation testing. The navigation system used Global Positioning System (GPS) and map-based guidance, assisted by an RGBdepth camera and a YOLOv8nseg instance segmentation model. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 85.2%, a recall of 88.9%, and a precision of 93.0%. The GPS-based approach reached a 100% completion rate (CR) within a $(5e-6)^{\circ}$ threshold, while the map-based method achieved a 96.7% CR within a 0.25 m threshold. The developed Robot Operating System (ROS) packages enable robust simulation of autonomous cotton picking, offering a scalable baseline for future agricultural robotics.

| **[Capturing a Moving Target by Two Robots in the F2F Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15688v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a search problem on capturing a moving target on an infinite real line. Two autonomous mobile robots (which can move with a maximum speed of 1) are initially placed at the origin, while an oblivious moving target is initially placed at a distance $d$ away from the origin. The robots can move along the line in any direction, but the target is oblivious, cannot change direction, and moves either away from or toward the origin at a constant speed $v$. Our aim is to design efficient algorithms for the two robots to capture the target. The target is captured only when both robots are co-located with it. The robots communicate with each other only face-to-face (F2F), meaning they can exchange information only when co-located, while the target remains oblivious and has no communication capabilities. We design algorithms under various knowledge scenarios, which take into account the prior knowledge the robots have about the starting distance $d$, the direction of movement (either toward or away from the origin), and the speed $v$ of the target. As a measure of the efficiency of the algorithms, we use the competitive ratio, which is the ratio of the capture time of an algorithm with limited knowledge to the capture time in the full-knowledge model. In our analysis, we are mindful of the cost of changing direction of movement, and show how to accomplish the capture of the target with at most three direction changes (turns).</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent interactions lead to collective frustration in robotic matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22148v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current artificial intelligence systems show near-human-level capabilities when deployed in isolation. Systems of a few collaborating intelligent agents are being engineered to perform tasks collectively. This raises the question of whether robotic matter, where many learning and intelligent agents interact, shows emergence of collective behaviour. And if so, which kind of phenomena would such systems exhibit? Here, we study a paradigmatic model for robotic matter: a stochastic many-particle system in which each particle is endowed with a deep neural network that predicts its transitions based on the particles' environments. For a one-dimensional model, we show that robotic matter exhibits complex emergent phenomena, including transitions between long-lived learning regimes, the emergence of particle species, and frustration. We also find a density-dependent phase transition with signatures of criticality. Using active matter theory, we show that this phase transition is a consequence of self-organisation mediated by emergent inter-particle interactions. Our simple model captures key features of more complex forms of robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

Designing control strategies for such systems is challenging due to model inaccuracies, sensor noise, and the need to discover locomotor gaits. In this work, we present a model-based reinforcement learning (MB-RL) framework in which latent dynamics inferred from onboard sensors serve as a predictive model that guides an actor-critic algorithm to optimize locomotor policies. We evaluate the framework on a minimal crawler model in simulation using inertial measurement units and time-of-flight sensors as observations. The learned latent dynamics enable short-horizon motion prediction while the actor-critic discovers effective locomotor policies. This approach highlights the potential of latent-dynamics MB-RL for enabling embodied soft robotic adaptive locomotion based solely on noisy sensor feedback.</p></details> |  |

However, due to significant interpersonal and intrapersonal variability in walking patterns, it is important to design robot controllers that can adapt to the unique characteristics of each individual. This paper investigates the potential of human-in-the-loop optimisation (HILO) to deliver personalised assistance in gait training. The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) was employed to continuously optimise an assist-as-needed controller of a lower-limb exoskeleton. Six healthy individuals participated over a two-day experiment. Our results suggest that while the CMA-ES appears to converge to a unique set of stiffnesses for each individual, no measurable impact on the subjects' performance was observed during the validation trials. These findings highlight the impact of human-robot co-adaptation and human behaviour variability, whose effect may be greater than potential benefits of personalising rule-based assistive controllers. Our work contributes to understanding the limitations of current personalisation approaches in exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation and identifies key challenges for effective implementation of human-in-the-loop optimisation in this domain.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we present a comprehensive study of FedSL frameworks tailored for resource-constrained robots in industrial scenarios. We compare synchronous, asynchronous, hierarchical, and heterogeneous FedSL frameworks in terms of workflow, scalability, adaptability, and limitations under dynamic industrial conditions. Furthermore, we systematically categorize token fusion strategies into three paradigms: input-level (pre-fusion), intermediate-level (intra-fusion), and output-level (post-fusion), and summarize their respective strengths in industrial applications. We also provide adaptive optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency and feasibility of FedSL implementation, including model compression, split layer selection, computing frequency allocation, and wireless resource management. Simulation results validate the performance of these frameworks under industrial detection scenarios. Finally, we outline open issues and research directions of FedSL in future smart manufacturing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the IEEE magazine</p></details> |

However, extending stability guarantees to trajectories defined on Riemannian manifolds poses significant challenges due to the manifold's geometric constraints. To address this, we propose a general framework for learning stable dynamical systems on Riemannian manifolds using neural ordinary differential equations. Our method guarantees stability by projecting the neural vector field evolving on the manifold so that it strictly satisfies the Lyapunov stability criterion, ensuring stability at every system state. By leveraging a flexible neural parameterisation for both the base vector field and the Lyapunov function, our framework can accurately represent complex trajectories while respecting manifold constraints by evolving solutions directly on the manifold. We provide an efficient training strategy for applying our framework and demonstrate its utility by solving Riemannian LASA datasets on the unit quaternion (S^3) and symmetric positive-definite matrix manifolds, as well as robotic motions evolving on \mathbb{R}^3 \times S^3. We demonstrate the performance, scalability, and practical applicability of our approach through extensive simulations and by learning robot motions in a real-world experiment.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Identifying Uncertainty in Self-Adaptive Robotics with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20684v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future self-adaptive robots are expected to operate in highly dynamic environments while effectively managing uncertainties. However, identifying the sources and impacts of uncertainties in such robotic systems and defining appropriate mitigation strategies is challenging due to the inherent complexity of self-adaptive robots and the lack of comprehensive knowledge about the various factors influencing uncertainty. Hence, practitioners often rely on intuition and past experiences from similar systems to address uncertainties. In this article, we evaluate the potential of large language models (LLMs) in enabling a systematic and automated approach to identify uncertainties in self-adaptive robotics throughout the software engineering lifecycle. For this evaluation, we analyzed 10 advanced LLMs with varying capabilities across four industrial-sized robotics case studies, gathering the practitioners' perspectives on the LLM-generated responses related to uncertainties. Results showed that practitioners agreed with 63-88% of the LLM responses and expressed strong interest in the practicality of LLMs for this purpose.</p></details> |  |

The system indexes curated robot knowledge (movement patterns, task templates, and safety heuristics) in a vector database, retrieves task-relevant context for each instruction, and conditions a large language model (LLM) to produce JSON-structured action plans. Plans are executed on a UFactory xArm 850 fitted with a Dynamixel-driven parallel gripper and an Intel RealSense D435 camera. Perception uses AprilTag detections fused with depth to produce object-centric metric poses. Execution is enforced via software safety gates: workspace bounds, speed and force caps, timeouts, and bounded retries. We describe the architecture, knowledge design, integration choices, and a reproducible evaluation protocol for tabletop scan, approach, and pick-place tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Our design shows that RAG-based planning can substantially improve plan validity and adaptability while keeping perception and low-level control local to the robot.</p></details> |  |

Equipped with an uncalibrated visual servoing controller, we propose to use robot knowledge graphs to unify behavior trees and geometric constraints, conceptualizing robot manipulation control as semantic events. The robot knowledge graphs not only preserve the advantages of behavior trees in scripting actions and behaviors, but also offer additional benefits of mapping natural interactions between concepts and events, which enable knowledgeable explanations of the manipulation contexts. Through real-world evaluations, we demonstrate the flexibility of the robot knowledge graphs to support explainable robot manipulation control.</p></details> |  |

While centralized sensor fusion has traditionally been used to improve pose estimation accuracy, this paper presents a novel decentralized fusion approach to estimate both pose and velocity. We use dual-view measurements from an eye-in-hand and an eye-to-hand vision sensor configuration mounted on a manipulator to track a target object whose motion is modeled as random walk (stochastic acceleration model). The robot runs two independent adaptive extended Kalman filters formulated on a matrix Lie group, developed as part of this work. These filters predict poses and velocities on the manifold $\mathbb{SE}(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3$ and update the state on the manifold $\mathbb{SE}(3)$. The final fused state comprising the fused pose and velocities of the target is obtained using a correlation-aware fusion rule on Lie groups. The proposed method is evaluated on a UFactory xArm 850 equipped with Intel RealSense cameras, tracking a moving target. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed decentralized dual-view estimation framework, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[AD-NODE: Adaptive Dynamics Learning with Neural ODEs for Mobile Robots Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05443v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robots, such as ground vehicles and quadrotors, are becoming increasingly important in various fields, from logistics to agriculture, where they automate processes in environments that are difficult to access for humans. However, to perform effectively in uncertain environments using model-based controllers, these systems require dynamics models capable of responding to environmental variations, especially when direct access to environmental information is limited. To enable such adaptivity and facilitate integration with model predictive control, we propose an adaptive dynamics model which bypasses the need for direct environmental knowledge by inferring operational environments from state-action history. The dynamics model is based on neural ordinary equations, and a two-phase training procedure is used to learn latent environment representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through goal-reaching and path-tracking tasks on three robotic platforms of increasing complexity: a 2D differential wheeled robot with changing wheel contact conditions, a 3D quadrotor in variational wind fields, and the Sphero BOLT robot under two contact conditions for real-world deployment. Empirical results corroborate that our method can handle temporally and spatially varying environmental changes in both simulation and real-world systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel online framework for adaptive human-robot interaction (HRI) that accommodates users' arm mobility impairments, ultimately aiming to promote active work participation. Unlike traditional human-robot collaboration approaches that assume able-bodied users, our method integrates a mobility model for specific joint limitations into a hierarchical optimal controller. This allows the robot to generate reactive, mobility-aware behaviour online and guides the user's impaired limb to exploit residual functional mobility. The framework was tested in handover tasks involving different upper-limb mobility impairments (i.e., emulated elbow and shoulder arthritis, and wrist blockage), under both standing and seated configurations with task constraints using a mobile manipulator, and complemented by quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art ergonomic HRI approaches. Preliminary results indicated that the framework can personalise the interaction to fit within the user's impaired range of motion and encourage joint usage based on the severity of their functional limitations.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a low-cost, easy-to-make, adaptable, and compact fingertip design for robotic hands that integrates multi-modal tactile sensors. We use strain gauge sensors to capture static forces and a contact microphone sensor to measure high-frequency vibrations during contact. These tactile sensors are integrated into a compact design with a minimal sensor footprint, and all sensors are internal to the fingertip and therefore not susceptible to direct wear and tear from interactions. From sensor characterization, we show that strain gauge sensors provide repeatable 2D planar force measurements in the 0-5 N range and the contact microphone sensor has the capability to distinguish contact material properties. We apply our design to three dexterous manipulation tasks that range from zero to full visual occlusion. Given the expressiveness and reliability of tactile sensor readings, we show that different tactile sensing modalities can be used flexibly in different stages of manipulation, solely or together with visual observations to achieve improved task performance. For instance, we can precisely count and unstack a desired number of paper cups from a stack with 100\% success rate which is hard to achieve with vision only.</p></details> |  |

Yet, current LLM-enabled robots typically depend on cloud-hosted models, limiting their usability in environments with unreliable communication infrastructure, such as outdoor or industrial settings. We present PRISM, a framework for distilling small language model (SLM)-enabled robot planners that run on-device with minimal human supervision. Starting from an existing LLM-enabled planner, PRISM automatically synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, elicits plans from the LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as a drop-in replacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners for mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we demonstrate that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of GPT-4o's performance to over 93% - using only synthetic data. We further demonstrate that the distilled planners generalize across heterogeneous robotic platforms (ground and aerial) and diverse environments (indoor and outdoor).

To trade-off onboard computation and plan quality, current systems have to limit all robot dynamics considerations only within the local planner, while leveraging an extremely simplified robot representation (e.g., a point-mass holonomic model without dynamics) in the global level. However, such an artificial decomposition based on either full or zero consideration of robot dynamics can lead to gaps between the two levels, e.g., a global path based on a holonomic point-mass model may not be realizable by a non-holonomic robot, especially in highly constrained obstacle environments. Motivated by such a limitation, we propose a novel paradigm, Decremental Dynamics Planning that integrates dynamic constraints into the entire planning process, with a focus on high-fidelity dynamics modeling at the beginning and a gradual fidelity reduction as the planning progresses. To validate the effectiveness of this paradigm, we augment three different planners with DDP and show overall improved planning performance. We also develop a new DDP-based navigation system, which achieves first place in the simulation phase of the 2025 BARN Challenge. Both simulated and physical experiments validate DDP's hypothesized benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

| **[Adaptive Dynamics Planning for Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05330v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robot navigation systems often rely on hierarchical planning, where global planners compute collision-free paths without considering dynamics, and local planners enforce dynamics constraints to produce executable commands. This discontinuity in dynamics often leads to trajectory tracking failure in highly constrained environments. Recent approaches integrate dynamics within the entire planning process by gradually decreasing its fidelity, e.g., increasing integration steps and reducing collision checking resolution, for real-time planning efficiency. However, they assume that the fidelity of the dynamics should decrease according to a manually designed scheme. Such static settings fail to adapt to environmental complexity variations, resulting in computational overhead in simple environments or insufficient dynamics consideration in obstacle-rich scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Adaptive Dynamics Planning (ADP), a learning-augmented paradigm that uses reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust robot dynamics properties, enabling planners to adapt across diverse environments. We integrate ADP into three different planners and further design a standalone ADP-based navigation system, benchmarking them against other baselines. Experiments in both simulation and real-world tests show that ADP consistently improves navigation success, safety, and efficiency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[VER: Vision Expert Transformer for Robot Learning via Foundation Distillation and Dynamic Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05213v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained vision foundation models (VFMs) advance robotic learning via rich visual representations, yet individual VFMs typically excel only in specific domains, limiting generality across tasks. Distilling multiple VFMs into a unified representation for policy can mitigate this limitation but often yields inflexible task-specific feature selection and requires costly full re-training to incorporate robot-domain knowledge. We propose VER, a Vision Expert transformer for Robot learning. During pretraining, VER distills multiple VFMs into a vision expert library. It then fine-tunes only a lightweight routing network (fewer than 0.4% of parameters) to dynamically select task-relevant experts from the pretrained library for downstream robot tasks. We further introduce Patchwise Expert Routing with Curriculum Top-K Annealing to improve both flexibility and precision of dynamic expert selection. Moreover, VER supports parameter-efficient finetuning for scalable expert utilization and adaptive robot-domain knowledge integration. Across 17 diverse robotic tasks and multiple policy heads, VER achieves state-of-the-art performance. We find that VER reduces large-norm outliers in task-irrelevant regions (e.g., background) and concentrates on task-critical regions. Visualizations and codes can be found in https://yixiaowang7.github.io/ver_page/.</p></details> |  |
| **[StaMo: Unsupervised Learning of Generalizable Robot Motion from Compact State Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05057v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in embodied intelligence is developing expressive and compact state representations for efficient world modeling and decision making. However, existing methods often fail to achieve this balance, yielding representations that are either overly redundant or lacking in task-critical information. We propose an unsupervised approach that learns a highly compressed two-token state representation using a lightweight encoder and a pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder, capitalizing on its strong generative prior. Our representation is efficient, interpretable, and integrates seamlessly into existing VLA-based models, improving performance by 14.3% on LIBERO and 30% in real-world task success with minimal inference overhead. More importantly, we find that the difference between these tokens, obtained via latent interpolation, naturally serves as a highly effective latent action, which can be further decoded into executable robot actions. This emergent capability reveals that our representation captures structured dynamics without explicit supervision. We name our method StaMo for its ability to learn generalizable robotic Motion from compact State representation, which is encoded from static images, challenging the prevalent dependence to learning latent action on complex architectures and video data. The resulting latent actions also enhance policy co-training, outperforming prior methods by 10.4% with improved interpretability. Moreover, our approach scales effectively across diverse data sources, including real-world robot data, simulation, and human egocentric video.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReLI: A Language-Agnostic Approach to Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01862v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting autonomous agents for real-world industrial, domestic, and other daily tasks is currently gaining momentum. However, in global or cross-lingual application contexts, ensuring effective interaction with the environment and executing unrestricted human-specified tasks regardless of the language remains an unsolved problem. To address this, we propose ReLI, a language-agnostic approach that enables autonomous agents to converse naturally, semantically reason about their environment, and perform downstream tasks, regardless of the task instruction's modality or linguistic origin. First, we ground large-scale pre-trained foundation models and transform them into language-to-action models that can directly provide common-sense reasoning and high-level robot control through natural, free-flow conversational interactions. Further, we perform cross-lingual adaptation of the models to ensure that ReLI generalises across the global languages. To demonstrate ReLI's robustness, we conducted extensive experiments on various short- and long-horizon tasks, including zero- and few-shot spatial navigation, scene information retrieval, and query-oriented tasks. We benchmarked the performance on $140$ languages involving $70K+$ multi-turn conversations. On average, ReLI achieved over $90\%\pm0.2$ accuracy in cross-lingual instruction parsing and task execution success. These results demonstrate its potential to advance natural human-agent interaction in the real world while championing inclusive and linguistic diversity. Demos and resources will be public at: https://linusnep.github.io/ReLI/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curiosity-Driven Co-Development of Action and Language in Robots Through Self-Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05013v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human infants acquire language and action co-developmentally, achieving remarkable generalization capabilities from only a minimal number of learning examples. In contrast, recent large language models require exposure to billions of training tokens to achieve such generalization. What mechanisms underlie such efficient developmental learning in humans? This study addresses this question through simulation experiments in which robots learn to perform various actions corresponding to imperative sentences (e.g., \textit{push red cube}) via trials of self-guided exploration. Our approach integrates the active inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling curiosity-driven developmental learning. The simulations yielded several nontrivial findings: i) Curiosity-driven exploration combined with motor noise substantially outperforms learning without curiosity. ii) Simpler, prerequisite-like actions emerge earlier in development, while more complex actions involving these prerequisites develop later. iii) Rote pairing of sentences and actions occurs before the emergence of compositional generalization. iv) Generalization is drastically improved as the number of compositional elements increases. These results shed light into possible mechanisms underlying efficient co-developmental learning in infants and provide computational parallels to findings in developmental psychology.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 14 pages of supplementary material</p></details> |

TARS3D translates the block-shaped 'TARS' robot from Interstellar into a 0.25 m, 0.99 kg research platform with seven actuated degrees of freedom. The film shows two primary gaits: a bipedal-like walk and a high-speed rolling mode. For TARS3D, we build reduced-order models for each, derive closed-form limit-cycle conditions, and validate the predictions on hardware. Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip limits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an eight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg provides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke double rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far richer gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored space. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under the right priors and discover novel behaviors as well. Our findings show that TARS3D's fiction-inspired bio-transcending morphology can realize multiple previously unexplored locomotion modes and that further learning-driven search is likely to reveal more. This combination of analytic synthesis and reinforcement learning opens a promising pathway for multimodal robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures.

However, in real-world human-robot collaboration, following human spoken instructions can be challenging due to various speaker and environmental factors, such as background noise or mispronunciation. When faced with noisy auditory inputs, humans can leverage the collaborative context in the embodied environment to interpret noisy spoken instructions and take pragmatic assistive actions. In this paper, we present a cognitively inspired neurosymbolic model, Spoken Instruction Following through Theory of Mind (SIFToM), which leverages a Vision-Language Model with model-based mental inference to enable robots to pragmatically follow human instructions under diverse speech conditions. We test SIFToM in both simulated environments (VirtualHome) and real-world human-robot collaborative settings with human evaluations. Results show that SIFToM can significantly improve the performance of a lightweight base VLM (Gemini 2.5 Flash), outperforming state-of-the-art VLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro) and approaching human-level accuracy on challenging spoken instruction following tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[HeLoM: Hierarchical Learning for Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation in Hexapod Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23651v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots in real-world environments are often required to move/manipulate objects comparable in weight to their own bodies. Compared to grasping and carrying, pushing provides a more straightforward and efficient non-prehensile manipulation strategy, avoiding complex grasp design while leveraging direct contact to regulate an object's pose. Achieving effective pushing, however, demands both sufficient manipulation forces and the ability to maintain stability, which is particularly challenging when dealing with heavy or irregular objects. To address these challenges, we propose HeLoM, a learning-based hierarchical whole-body manipulation framework for a hexapod robot that exploits coordinated multi-limb control. Inspired by the cooperative strategies of multi-legged insects, our framework leverages redundant contact points and high degrees of freedom to enable dynamic redistribution of contact forces. HeLoM's high-level planner plans pushing behaviors and target object poses, while its low-level controller maintains locomotion stability and generates dynamically consistent joint actions. Our policies trained in simulation are directly deployed on real robots without additional fine-tuning. This design allows the robot to maintain balance while exerting continuous and controllable pushing forces through coordinated foreleg interaction and supportive hind-leg propulsion. We validate the effectiveness of HeLoM through both simulation and real-world experiments. Results show that our framework can stably push boxes of varying sizes and unknown physical properties to designated goal poses in the real world.</p></details> |  |

| **[Building Gradient by Gradient: Decentralised Energy Functions for Bimanual Robot Assembly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04696v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many challenges in bimanual assembly, including high-level sequencing, multi-robot coordination, and low-level, contact-rich operations such as component mating. Task and motion planning (TAMP) methods, while effective in this domain, may be prohibitively slow to converge when adapting to disturbances that require new task sequencing and optimisation. These events are common during tight-tolerance assembly, where difficult-to-model dynamics such as friction or deformation require rapid replanning and reattempts. Moreover, defining explicit task sequences for assembly can be cumbersome, limiting flexibility when task replanning is required. To simplify this planning, we introduce a decentralised gradient-based framework that uses a piecewise continuous energy function through the automatic composition of adaptive potential functions. This approach generates sub-goals using only myopic optimisation, rather than long-horizon planning. It demonstrates effectiveness at solving long-horizon tasks due to the structure and adaptivity of the energy function. We show that our approach scales to physical bimanual assembly tasks for constructing tight-tolerance assemblies. In these experiments, we discover that our gradient-based rapid replanning framework generates automatic retries, coordinated motions and autonomous handovers in an emergent fashion.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Studying avian behavior in the wild remains challenging due to the need for highly realistic morphology, durable outdoor operation, and intelligent perception that can adapt to uncontrolled environments. We present a next generation bio inspired robotic platform that replicates the morphology and visual appearance of the female Houbara bustard to support controlled ethological studies and conservation oriented field research. The system introduces a fully digitally replicable fabrication workflow that combines high resolution structured light 3D scanning, parametric CAD modelling, articulated 3D printing, and photorealistic UV textured vinyl finishing to achieve anatomically accurate and durable robotic surrogates. A six wheeled rocker bogie chassis ensures stable mobility on sand and irregular terrain, while an embedded NVIDIA Jetson module enables real time RGB and thermal perception, lightweight YOLO based detection, and an autonomous visual servoing loop that aligns the robot's head toward detected targets without human intervention. A lightweight thermal visible fusion module enhances perception in low light conditions. Field trials in desert aviaries demonstrated reliable real time operation at 15 to 22 FPS with latency under 100 ms and confirmed that the platform elicits natural recognition and interactive responses from live Houbara bustards under harsh outdoor conditions. This integrated framework advances biomimetic field robotics by uniting reproducible digital fabrication, embodied visual intelligence, and ecological validation, providing a transferable blueprint for animal robot interaction research, conservation robotics, and public engagement.</p></details> |  |

A simulation environment is developed, incorporating sloshing dynamics of the chaser, a rarely studied effect in space robotics. The proposed controller combines an inner Lyapunov-based robust control loop for multi-body dynamics with an outer loop addressing an extended inverse kinematics problem. Simulation results show improved robustness and adaptability compared to existing control schemes.</p></details> |  |

However, in object manipulation tasks, unknown external payloads and disturbances can significantly alter the system dynamics and behavior, leading to offset error and degraded control performance. In this paper, we present a novel velocity-form DeePC framework that achieves robust and optimal control of soft robots under unknown payloads. The proposed framework leverages input-output data in an incremental representation to mitigate performance degradation induced by unknown payloads, eliminating the need for weighted datasets or disturbance estimators. We validate the method experimentally on a planar soft robot and demonstrate its superior performance compared to standard DeePC in scenarios involving unknown payloads.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Hand Manipulation of Articulated Tools with Dexterous Robot Hands with Sim-to-Real Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23075v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) and sim-to-real transfer have advanced robotic manipulation of rigid objects. Yet, policies remain brittle when applied to articulated mechanisms due to contact-rich dynamics and under-modeled joint phenomena such as friction, stiction, backlash, and clearances. We address this challenge through dexterous in-hand manipulation of articulated tools using a robotic hand with reduced articulation and kinematic redundancy relative to the human hand. Our controller augments a simulation-trained base policy with a sensor-driven refinement learned from hardware demonstrations, conditioning on proprioception and target articulation states while fusing whole-hand tactile and force feedback with the policy's internal action intent via cross-attention-based integration. This design enables online adaptation to instance-specific articulation properties, stabilizes contact interactions, regulates internal forces, and coordinates coupled-link motion under perturbations. We validate our approach across a diversity of real-world examples, including scissors, pliers, minimally invasive surgical tools, and staplers. We achieve robust transfer from simulation to hardware, improved disturbance resilience, and generalization to previously unseen articulated tools, thereby reducing reliance on precise physical modeling in contact-rich settings.</p></details> |  |

| **[Reliable and Scalable Robot Policy Evaluation with Imperfect Simulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04354v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid progress in imitation learning, foundation models, and large-scale datasets has led to robot manipulation policies that generalize to a wide-range of tasks and environments. However, rigorous evaluation of these policies remains a challenge. Typically in practice, robot policies are often evaluated on a small number of hardware trials without any statistical assurances. We present SureSim, a framework to augment large-scale simulation with relatively small-scale real-world testing to provide reliable inferences on the real-world performance of a policy. Our key idea is to formalize the problem of combining real and simulation evaluations as a prediction-powered inference problem, in which a small number of paired real and simulation evaluations are used to rectify bias in large-scale simulation. We then leverage non-asymptotic mean estimation algorithms to provide confidence intervals on mean policy performance. Using physics-based simulation, we evaluate both diffusion policy and multi-task fine-tuned \(\pi_0\) on a joint distribution of objects and initial conditions, and find that our approach saves over \(20-25\%\) of hardware evaluation effort to achieve similar bounds on policy performance.</p></details> |  |

This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.</p></details> | We are revising it |

Dual-model pipeline method and large multimodal model were compared, and the GPT-4o multimodal model was adopted in license plate recognition without preprocessing. For moving smoothly on a flat ground, the robot navigated in a simulated parking lot in the experiments. The robot changes angle view of the camera automatically to capture the images around with the format of license plate number. From the captured images of the robot, the numbers on the plate are recognized through the GPT-4o model, and identifies legality of the numbers. When an illegal parking is detected, the robot sends Line messages to the system manager immediately. The contribution of the work is that a novel multimodal deep learning method has validated with high accuracy in license plate recognition, and a social assistive robot is also provided for solving problems in a real scenario, and can be applied in an indoor parking lot.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the use of robotics to facilitate transcatheter procedures in the context of mitral valve edge-to-edge repair. The complex handle-based control of a clinical repair device is replaced by intuitive robotic joint-based control via a game controller. Manual versus robotic performance is analyzed by decomposing the overall device delivery task into motion-specific steps and comparing capabilities on a step-by-step basis in a phantom model of the heart and vasculature. Metrics include procedure duration and clip placement accuracy. Results demonstrate that the robotic system can reduce procedural time and motion errors while also improving accuracy of clip placement. These findings suggest that robotic assistance can address key limitations of manual systems, offering a more reliable and user-friendly platform for complex transcatheter procedures.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |

A key challenge there is to intelligently allocate the robots to the unknown areas to be explored and determine the visiting order of those spaces subject to traversablity constraints, which leads to a large scale constrained optimization problem that needs to be quickly and iteratively solved every time when new space are explored. To address the challenge, we propose HEHA (Hierarchical Exploration with Heterogeneous Agents) by leveraging a recent hierarchical method that decompose the exploration into global planning and local planning. The major contribution in HEHA is its global planning, where we propose a new routing algorithm PEAF (Partial Anytime Focal search) that can quickly find bounded sub-optimal solutions to minimize the maximum path length among the agents subject to traversability constraints. Additionally, the local planner in HEHA also considers heterogeneity to avoid repeated and duplicated exploration among the robots. The experimental results show that, our HEHA can reduce up to 30% of the exploration time than the baselines.</p></details> | 5 Figures |

Traditional approaches often rely on greedy frontier assignment strategies with limited inter-robot coordination. In this work, we introduce LLM-MCoX (LLM-based Multi-robot Coordinated Exploration and Search), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent coordination of both homogeneous and heterogeneous robot teams tasked with efficient exploration and target object search. Our approach combines real-time LiDAR scan processing for frontier cluster extraction and doorway detection with multimodal LLM reasoning (e.g., GPT-4o) to generate coordinated waypoint assignments based on shared environment maps and robot states. LLM-MCoX demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, including greedy and Voronoi-based planners, achieving 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% improved search efficiency in large environments with 6 robots. Notably, LLM-MCoX enables natural language-based object search capabilities, allowing human operators to provide high-level semantic guidance that traditional algorithms cannot interpret.</p></details> |  |

Robotic feeding systems offer the potential to enhance autonomy and quality of life for individuals with impairments and reduce caregiver workload. However, their widespread adoption has been limited by technical challenges such as estimating bite timing, the appropriate moment for the robot to transfer food to a user's mouth. In this work, we introduce WAFFLE: Wearable Approach For Feeding with LEarned bite timing, a system that accurately predicts bite timing by leveraging wearable sensor data to be highly reactive to natural user cues such as head movements, chewing, and talking. We train a supervised regression model on bite timing data from 14 participants and incorporate a user-adjustable assertiveness threshold to convert predictions into proceed or stop commands. In a study with 15 participants without motor impairments with the Obi feeding robot, WAFFLE performs statistically on par with or better than baseline methods across measures of feeling of control, robot understanding, and workload, and is preferred by the majority of participants for both individual and social dining. We further demonstrate WAFFLE's generalizability in a study with 2 participants with motor impairments in their home environments using a Kinova 7DOF robot. Our findings support WAFFLE's effectiveness in enabling natural, reactive bite timing that generalizes across users, robot hardware, robot positioning, feeding trajectories, foods, and both individual and social dining contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[NoTVLA: Narrowing of Dense Action Trajectories for Generalizable Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03895v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a pivotal advance in embodied intelligence, yet they confront critical barriers to real-world deployment, most notably catastrophic forgetting. This issue stems from their overreliance on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA) framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories, thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot. In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints: it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboSwap: A GAN-driven Video Diffusion Framework For Unsupervised Robot Arm Swapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08632v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis and editing. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the first systematic study quantifying how visual degradations--including blur, salt-and-pepper noise, and Gaussian noise--affect robotic self-modeling. Through both simulation and physical experiments, we demonstrate their impact on morphology prediction, trajectory planning, and damage recovery in state-of-the-art pipelines. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a task-aware denoising framework that couples classical restoration with morphology-preserving constraints, ensuring retention of structural cues critical for self-modeling. In addition, we integrate semantic segmentation to robustly isolate robots from cluttered and colorful scenes. Extensive experiments show that our approach restores near-baseline performance across simulated and physical platforms, while existing pipelines degrade significantly. These contributions advance the robustness of visual self-modeling and establish practical foundations for deploying self-aware robots in unpredictable real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by soft-bodied inchworm, we present a fully untethered soft robot with a curved, flexible structure actuated by magnetic forces. The robot has a total mass of 102.63 g and demonstrates multimodal locomotion, achieving a maximum walking speed of 3.74 cm/s and a swimming speed of 0.82 cm/s. A compact and lightweight onboard control circuit enables wireless command transmission, while an integrated camera provides environmental perception.

| **[Learning to Act Through Contact: A Unified View of Multi-Task Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03599v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a unified framework for multi-task locomotion and manipulation policy learning grounded in a contact-explicit representation. Instead of designing different policies for different tasks, our approach unifies the definition of a task through a sequence of contact goals-desired contact positions, timings, and active end-effectors. This enables leveraging the shared structure across diverse contact-rich tasks, leading to a single policy that can perform a wide range of tasks. In particular, we train a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) policy to realise given contact plans. We validate our framework on multiple robotic embodiments and tasks: a quadruped performing multiple gaits, a humanoid performing multiple biped and quadrupedal gaits, and a humanoid executing different bimanual object manipulation tasks. Each of these scenarios is controlled by a single policy trained to execute different tasks grounded in contacts, demonstrating versatile and robust behaviours across morphologically distinct systems. Our results show that explicit contact reasoning significantly improves generalisation to unseen scenarios, positioning contact-explicit policy learning as a promising foundation for scalable loco-manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shape-Space Graphs: Fast and Collision-Free Path Planning for Soft Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03547v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots, inspired by elephant trunks or octopus arms, offer extraordinary flexibility to bend, twist, and elongate in ways that rigid robots cannot. However, their motion planning remains a challenge, especially in cluttered environments with obstacles, due to their highly nonlinear and infinite-dimensional kinematics. Here, we present a graph-based path planning tool for an elephant-trunk-inspired soft robotic arm designed with three artificial muscle fibers that allow for multimodal continuous deformation through contraction. Using a biomechanical model inspired by morphoelasticity and active filament theory, we precompute a shape library and construct a $k$-nearest neighbor graph in \emph{shape space}, ensuring that each node corresponds to a mechanically accurate and physically valid robot shape. For the graph, we use signed distance functions to prune nodes and edges colliding with obstacles, and define multi-objective edge costs based on geometric distance and actuation effort, enabling energy-efficient planning with collision avoidance. We demonstrate that our algorithm reliably avoids obstacles and generates feasible paths within milliseconds from precomputed graphs using Dijkstra's algorithm. We show that including energy costs can drastically reduce the actuation effort compared to geometry-only planning, at the expense of longer tip trajectories. Our results highlight the potential of shape-space graph search for fast and reliable path planning in the field of soft robotics, paving the way for real-time applications in surgical, industrial, and assistive settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Surgical Robotic Instrument Pose Reconstruction in Real World Conditions Using Unified Feature Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03532v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate camera-to-robot calibration is essential for any vision-based robotic control system and especially critical in minimally invasive surgical robots, where instruments conduct precise micro-manipulations. However, MIS robots have long kinematic chains and partial visibility of their degrees of freedom in the camera, which introduces challenges for conventional camera-to-robot calibration methods that assume stiff robots with good visibility. Previous works have investigated both keypoint-based and rendering-based approaches to address this challenge in real-world conditions; however, they often struggle with consistent feature detection or have long inference times, neither of which are ideal for online robot control. In this work, we propose a novel framework that unifies the detection of geometric primitives (keypoints and shaft edges) through a shared encoding, enabling efficient pose estimation via projection geometry. This architecture detects both keypoints and edges in a single inference and is trained on large-scale synthetic data with projective labeling. This method is evaluated across both feature detection and pose estimation, with qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating fast performance and state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging surgical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[LapSurgie: Humanoid Robots Performing Surgery via Teleoperated Handheld Laparoscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03529v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic laparoscopic surgery has gained increasing attention in recent years for its potential to deliver more efficient and precise minimally invasive procedures. However, adoption of surgical robotic platforms remains largely confined to high-resource medical centers, exacerbating healthcare disparities in rural and low-resource regions. To close this gap, a range of solutions has been explored, from remote mentorship to fully remote telesurgery. Yet, the practical deployment of surgical robotic systems to underserved communities remains an unsolved challenge. Humanoid systems offer a promising path toward deployability, as they can directly operate in environments designed for humans without extensive infrastructure modifications -- including operating rooms. In this work, we introduce LapSurgie, the first humanoid-robot-based laparoscopic teleoperation framework. The system leverages an inverse-mapping strategy for manual-wristed laparoscopic instruments that abides to remote center-of-motion constraints, enabling precise hand-to-tool control of off-the-shelf surgical laparoscopic tools without additional setup requirements. A control console equipped with a stereo vision system provides real-time visual feedback. Finally, a comprehensive user study across platforms demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework and provides initial evidence for the feasibility of deploying humanoid robots in laparoscopic procedures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Digital-Twin Evaluation for Proactive Human-Robot Collision Avoidance via Prediction-Guided A-RRT*](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03496v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-robot collaboration requires precise prediction of human motion over extended horizons to enable proactive collision avoidance. Unlike existing planners that rely solely on kinodynamic models, we present a prediction-driven safe planning framework that leverages granular, joint-by-joint human motion forecasting validated in a physics-based digital twin. A capsule-based artificial potential field (APF) converts these granular predictions into collision risk metrics, triggering an Adaptive RRT* (A-RRT*) planner when thresholds are exceeded. The depth camera is used to extract 3D skeletal poses and a convolutional neural network-bidirectional long short-term memory (CNN-BiLSTM) model to predict individual joint trajectories ahead of time. A digital twin model integrates real-time human posture prediction placed in front of a simulated robot to evaluate motions and physical contacts. The proposed method enables validation of planned trajectories ahead of time and bridging potential latency gaps in updating planned trajectories in real-time. In 50 trials, our method achieved 100% proactive avoidance with > 250 mm clearance and sub-2 s replanning, demonstrating superior precision and reliability compared to existing kinematic-only planners through the integration of predictive human modeling with digital twin validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Destination-to-Chutes Task Mapping Optimization for Multi-Robot Coordination in Robotic Sorting Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03472v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study optimizing a destination-to-chutes task mapping to improve throughput in Robotic Sorting Systems (RSS), where a team of robots sort packages on a sortation floor by transporting them from induct workstations to eject chutes based on their shipping destinations (e.g. Los Angeles or Pittsburgh). The destination-to-chutes task mapping is used to determine which chutes a robot can drop its package. Finding a high-quality task mapping is challenging because of the complexity of a real-world RSS. First, optimizing task mapping is interdependent with robot target assignment and path planning. Second, chutes will be CLOSED for a period of time once they receive sufficient packages to allow for downstream processing. Third, task mapping quality directly impacts the downstream processing, as scattered chutes for the same destination increase package handling time. In this paper, we first formally define task mappings and the problem of Task Mapping Optimization (TMO). We then present a simulator of RSS to evaluate task mappings. We then present a simple TMO method based on the Evolutionary Algorithm and Mixed Integer Linear Programming, demonstrating the advantage of our optimized task mappings over the greedily generated ones in various RSS setups with different map sizes, numbers of chutes, and destinations. Finally, we use Quality Diversity algorithms to analyze the throughput of a diverse set of task mappings.

| **[From Real World to Logic and Back: Learning Generalizable Relational Concepts For Long Horizon Robot Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11871v6)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots still lag behind humans in their ability to generalize from limited experience, particularly when transferring learned behaviors to long-horizon tasks in unseen environments. We present the first method that enables robots to autonomously invent symbolic, relational concepts directly from a small number of raw, unsegmented, and unannotated demonstrations. From these, the robot learns logic-based world models that support zero-shot generalization to tasks of far greater complexity than those in training. Our framework achieves performance on par with hand-engineered symbolic models, while scaling to execution horizons far beyond training and handling up to 18$\times$ more objects than seen during learning. The results demonstrate a framework for autonomously acquiring transferable symbolic abstractions from raw robot experience, contributing toward the development of interpretable, scalable, and generalizable robot planning systems.

| **[Warm-Starting Optimization-Based Motion Planning for Robotic Manipulators via Point Cloud-Conditioned Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03460v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid robot motion generation is critical in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) systems, as robots need to respond to dynamic environments in real time by continuously observing their surroundings and replanning their motions to ensure both safe interactions and efficient task execution. Current sampling-based motion planners face challenges in scaling to high-dimensional configuration spaces and often require post-processing to interpolate and smooth the generated paths, resulting in time inefficiency in complex environments. Optimization-based planners, on the other hand, can incorporate multiple constraints and generate smooth trajectories directly, making them potentially more time-efficient. However, optimization-based planners are sensitive to initialization and may get stuck in local minima. In this work, we present a novel learning-based method that utilizes a Flow Matching model conditioned on a single-view point cloud to learn near-optimal solutions for optimization initialization. Our method does not require prior knowledge of the environment, such as obstacle locations and geometries, and can generate feasible trajectories directly from single-view depth camera input. Simulation studies on a UR5e robotic manipulator in cluttered workspaces demonstrate that the proposed generative initializer achieves a high success rate on its own, significantly improves the success rate of trajectory optimization compared with traditional and learning-based benchmark initializers, requires fewer optimization iterations, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Stability Certificate for Robotics in Real-World Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03123v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stability certificates play a critical role in ensuring the safety and reliability of robotic systems. However, deriving these certificates for complex, unknown systems has traditionally required explicit knowledge of system dynamics, often making it a daunting task. This work introduces a novel framework that learns a Lyapunov function directly from trajectory data, enabling the certification of stability for autonomous systems without needing detailed system models. By parameterizing the Lyapunov candidate using a neural network and ensuring positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, our approach automatically identifies whether the system is stable under the given trajectory. To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow for controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining high confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate that this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a robust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic, real-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal control algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system behavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is open-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embracing Evolution: A Call for Body-Control Co-Design in Embodied Humanoid Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03081v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots, as general-purpose physical agents, must integrate both intelligent control and adaptive morphology to operate effectively in diverse real-world environments. While recent research has focused primarily on optimizing control policies for fixed robot structures, this position paper argues for evolving both control strategies and humanoid robots' physical structure under a co-design mechanism. Inspired by biological evolution, this approach enables robots to iteratively adapt both their form and behavior to optimize performance within task-specific and resource-constrained contexts. Despite its promise, co-design in humanoid robotics remains a relatively underexplored domain, raising fundamental questions about its feasibility and necessity in achieving true embodied intelligence. To address these challenges, we propose practical co-design methodologies grounded in strategic exploration, Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning. We further argue for the essential role of co-design by analyzing it from methodological, application-driven, and community-oriented perspectives. Striving to guide and inspire future studies, we present open research questions, spanning from short-term innovations to long-term goals. This work positions co-design as a cornerstone for developing the next generation of intelligent and adaptable humanoid agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Rod Brachiation Robot: Mechatronic Control Design and Validation of Prejump Phases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02946v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A complete mechatronic design of a minimal configuration brachiation robot is presented. The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system, and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are experimentally validated.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 13 figures, 1 table, Accepted 27 July 2025, Available online 16 Sept 2025, Version of Record 28 Sept 2025</p></details> |
| **[Metrics vs Surveys: Can Quantitative Measures Replace Human Surveys in Social Robot Navigation? A Correlation Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02941v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the integration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such systems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be considered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys, provide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to reproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation metrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks consensus on a standard set of metrics. This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific quantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as standardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results indicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation behavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and new metrics are necessary.</p></details> |  |
| **[Point Cloud-Based Control Barrier Functions for Model Predictive Control in Safety-Critical Navigation of Autonomous Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02885v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm to facilitate safety-critical navigation for autonomous mobile robots. The proposed algorithm integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in obstacle avoidance. The source code is released for the reference of the robotics community.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, accepted to IROS2025</p></details> |
| **[Novel UWB Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging for Mobile Robot Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02874v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional exteroceptive sensors in mobile robots, such as LiDARs and cameras often struggle to perceive the environment in poor visibility conditions. Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have emerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse environmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small apertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed image of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large aperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The resulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition representation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a pipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an unknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature detectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB SAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental conditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection toward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the 15th International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN) 2025, see https://ipin-conference.org/2025/</p></details> |
| **[Action Deviation-Aware Inference for Low-Latency Wireless Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02851v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target model and selectively skips communication and computation for server operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model only inference.</p></details> |  |
