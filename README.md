| **[Deception in LLMs: Self-Preservation and Autonomous Goals in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16513v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have incorporated planning and reasoning capabilities, enabling models to outline steps before execution and provide transparent reasoning paths. This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions. This highlights the critical need for robust goal specification and safety frameworks before any physical implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysBench: Benchmarking and Enhancing Vision-Language Models for Physical World Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16411v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physical world is a fundamental challenge in embodied AI, critical for enabling agents to perform complex tasks and operate safely in real-world environments. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 100,000 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

| **[From Screens to Scenes: A Survey of Embodied AI in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07468v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare systems worldwide face persistent challenges in efficiency, accessibility, and personalization. Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | 58 pages, 11 figures |
| **[SpatialCoT: Advancing Spatial Reasoning through Coordinate Alignment and Chain-of-Thought for Embodied Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10074v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning is an essential problem in embodied AI research. Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[EmbodiedEval: Evaluate Multimodal LLMs as Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11858v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant advancements, providing a promising future for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenEx: Generating an Explorable World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09624v4)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding, navigating, and exploring the 3D physical real world has long been a central challenge in the development of artificial intelligence. In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</p></details> | Website: GenEx.world |
| **[Embodied Agent Interface: Benchmarking LLMs for Embodied Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07166v3)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for embodied decision making. While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

| **[Embodied Scene Understanding for Vision Language Models via MetaVQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09167v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate significant potential as embodied AI agents for various mobility applications. However, a standardized, closed-loop benchmark for evaluating their spatial reasoning and sequential decision-making capabilities is lacking. To address this, we present MetaVQA: a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess and enhance VLMs' understanding of spatial relationships and scene dynamics through Visual Question Answering (VQA) and closed-loop simulations. MetaVQA leverages Set-of-Mark prompting and top-down view ground-truth annotations from nuScenes and Waymo datasets to automatically generate extensive question-answer pairs based on diverse real-world traffic scenarios, ensuring object-centric and context-rich instructions. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with the MetaVQA dataset significantly improves their spatial reasoning and embodied scene comprehension in safety-critical simulations, evident not only in improved VQA accuracies but also in emerging safety-aware driving maneuvers. In addition, the learning demonstrates strong transferability from simulation to real-world observation. Code and data will be publicly available at https://metadriverse.github.io/metavqa .</p></details> | <details><summary>for t...</summary><p>for the project webpage, see https://metadriverse.github.io/metavqa</p></details> |
| **[Physical AI Agents: Integrating Cognitive Intelligence with Real-World Action](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08944v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vertical AI Agents are revolutionizing industries by delivering domain-specific intelligence and tailored solutions. However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks. This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context. Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Mind the Error! Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

| **[Perception Matters: Enhancing Embodied AI with Uncertainty-Aware Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02297v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI has made significant progress acting in unexplored environments. However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Mapping in Indoor Embodied AI -- A Comprehensive Survey and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05750v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent embodied agents (e.g. robots) need to perform complex semantic tasks in unfamiliar environments. Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied VideoAgent: Persistent Memory from Egocentric Videos and Embodied Sensors Enables Dynamic Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00358v2)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the problem of understanding dynamic 3D scenes from egocentric observations, a key challenge in robotics and embodied AI. Unlike prior studies that explored this as long-form video understanding and utilized egocentric video only, we instead propose an LLM-based agent, Embodied VideoAgent, which constructs scene memory from both egocentric video and embodied sensory inputs (e.g. depth and pose sensing). We further introduce a VLM-based approach to automatically update the memory when actions or activities over objects are perceived. Embodied VideoAgent attains significant advantages over counterparts in challenging reasoning and planning tasks in 3D scenes, achieving gains of 4.9% on Ego4D-VQ3D, 5.8% on OpenEQA, and 11.7% on EnvQA. We have also demonstrated its potential in various embodied AI tasks including generating embodied interactions and perception for robot manipulation. The code and demo will be made public.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://embodied-videoagent.github.io/</p></details> |

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |
| **[ViGiL3D: A Linguistically Diverse Dataset for 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01366v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D visual grounding (3DVG) involves localizing entities in a 3D scene referred to by natural language text. Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Embodied AI-Enhanced Vehicular Networks: An Integrated Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01141v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates adaptive transmission strategies in embodied AI-enhanced vehicular networks by integrating large language models (LLMs) for semantic information extraction and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for decision-making. The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Embodied Image Quality Assessment for Robotic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18774v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) of user-generated content (UGC) is a critical technique for human quality of experience (QoE). However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

Additionally, we offer a variety of playable entities for embodied AI agents. Based on UnrealCV, we provide a suite of easy-to-use Python APIs and tools for various potential applications, such as data collection, environment augmentation, distributed training, and benchmarking. We optimize the rendering and communication efficiency of UnrealCV to support advanced applications, such as multi-agent interaction. Our experiments benchmark agents in various complex scenes, focusing on visual navigation and tracking, which are fundamental capabilities for embodied visual intelligence. The results yield valuable insights into the advantages of diverse training environments for reinforcement learning (RL) agents and the challenges faced by current embodied vision agents, including those based on RL and large vision-language models (VLMs), in open worlds. These challenges involve latency in closed-loop control in dynamic scenes and reasoning about 3D spatial structures in unstructured terrain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: http://unrealzoo.site/</p></details> |

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV. Finally, we discuss several future research directions for advancing EAI-enabled LAE.</p></details> |  |
| **[MrSteve: Instruction-Following Agents in Minecraft with What-Where-When Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06736v4)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant advances have been made in developing general-purpose embodied AI in environments like Minecraft through the adoption of LLM-augmented hierarchical approaches. While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</p></details> |  |

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[ZeroHSI: Zero-Shot 4D Human-Scene Interaction by Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18600v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-scene interaction (HSI) generation is crucial for applications in embodied AI, virtual reality, and robotics. While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/</p></details> |
| **[LMD-PGN: Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation from First-Person-View Images to Third-Person-View BEV Maps for Universal Point Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17282v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point goal navigation (PGN) is a mapless navigation approach that trains robots to visually navigate to goal points without relying on pre-built maps. Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD).

| **[POEX: Policy Executable Embodied AI Jailbreak Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16633v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into the planning module of Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) systems has greatly enhanced their ability to translate complex user instructions into executable policies. In this paper, we demystified how traditional LLM jailbreak attacks behave in the Embodied AI context. We conducted a comprehensive safety analysis of the LLM-based planning module of embodied AI systems against jailbreak attacks. Using the carefully crafted Harmful-RLbench, we accessed 20 open-source and proprietary LLMs under traditional jailbreak attacks, and highlighted two key challenges when adopting the prior jailbreak techniques to embodied AI contexts: (1) The harmful text output by LLMs does not necessarily induce harmful policies in Embodied AI context, and (2) even we can generate harmful policies, we have to guarantee they are executable in practice. To overcome those challenges, we propose Policy Executable (POEX) jailbreak attacks, where harmful instructions and optimized suffixes are injected into LLM-based planning modules, leading embodied AI to perform harmful actions in both simulated and physical environments. Our approach involves constraining adversarial suffixes to evade detection and fine-tuning a policy evaluater to improve the executability of harmful policies. We conducted extensive experiments on both a robotic arm embodied AI platform and simulators, to validate the attack and policy success rates on 136 harmful instructions from Harmful-RLbench. Our findings expose serious safety vulnerabilities in LLM-based planning modules, including the ability of POEX to be transferred across models. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies, such as safety-constrained prompts, pre- and post-planning checks, to address these vulnerabilities and ensure the safe deployment of embodied AI in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of previous magical grasp implementations at similar GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |
| **[ON as ALC: Active Loop Closing Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11523v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In simultaneous localization and mapping, active loop closing (ALC) is an active vision problem that aims to visually guide a robot to maximize the chances of revisiting previously visited points, thereby resetting the drift errors accumulated in the incrementally built map during travel. However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grasp What You Want: Embodied Dexterous Grasping System Driven by Your Voice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10694v1)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, as robotics has advanced, human-robot collaboration has gained increasing importance. However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task of embodied AI that requires the agent to find a target object in unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging as it demands both perceptual and cognitive processes for effective perception and decision-making. While perception has gained significant progress powered by the rapidly developed visual foundation models, the progress on the cognitive side remains limited to either implicitly learning from massive navigation demonstrations or explicitly leveraging pre-defined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that humans consistently update their cognitive states while searching for objects in unseen environments, we present CogNav, which attempts to model this cognitive process with the help of large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process with a finite state machine composed of cognitive states ranging from exploration to identification. The transitions between the states are determined by a large language model based on an online built heterogeneous cognitive map containing spatial and semantic information of the scene being explored. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world environments demonstrate that our cognitive modeling significantly improves ObjectNav efficiency, with human-like navigation behaviors. In an open-vocabulary and zero-shot setting, our method advances the SOTA of the HM3D benchmark from 69.3% to 87.2%. The code and data will be released.</p></details> |  |

The central case study is Jess+ an intelligent digital score system for shared creativity with a mixed ensemble of non-disabled and disabled musicians. The overarching aim is that the digital score enables disabled musicians to thrive in a live music conversation with other musicians regardless of the potential barriers of disability and music-making. After defining what we mean by embodied AI and how this approach supports the aims of the Jess+ project, we outline the main design features of the system. This includes several novel approaches such as its modular design, an AI Factory based on an embodied musicking dataset, and an embedded belief system. Our findings showed that the implemented design decisions and embodied-AI approach led to rich experiences for the musicians which in turn transformed their practice as an inclusive ensemble.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models in Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07904v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated a wide range of capabilities across many domains, including Embodied AI. In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This study finds that state-of-the-art embodied AI agents compete for higher navigation quality, but often compromise the computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce "Skip-SCAR," an optimization framework that builds computationally and memory-efficient embodied AI agents to accomplish high-quality visual navigation tasks. Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint. Tested on the HM3D ObjectNav datasets and real-world physical hardware systems, Skip-SCAR not only minimizes hardware resources but also sets new performance benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of optimizing both navigation quality and computational efficiency for robotics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Privacy Risks in Reinforcement Learning for Household Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09273v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prominence of embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI), which empowers robots to navigate, perceive, and engage within virtual environments, has attracted significant attention, owing to the remarkable advances in computer vision and large language models. Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |

Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

Despite recent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods often lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in scenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this paper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and scalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors and multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion (OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved surfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric fidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital twins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM-based planners are inefficient due to their large number of parameters and prone to inaccuracies because they operate in open-loop systems. We think the reason is that only applying LLMs as planners is insufficient. In this work, we propose DaDu-E, a robust closed-loop planning framework for embodied AI robots. Specifically, DaDu-E is equipped with a relatively lightweight LLM, a set of encapsulated robot skill instructions, a robust feedback system, and memory augmentation. Together, these components enable DaDu-E to (i) actively perceive and adapt to dynamic environments, (ii) optimize computational costs while maintaining high performance, and (iii) recover from execution failures using its memory and feedback mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world and simulated tasks show that DaDu-E achieves task success rates comparable to embodied AI robots with larger models as planners like COME-Robot, while reducing computational requirements by $6.6 \times$.

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters, connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and easy integration with downstream tasks.

| **[LSceneLLM: Enhancing Large 3D Scene Understanding Using Adaptive Visual Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01292v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on 3D Vision-Language Models (3D-VLMs) is gaining increasing attention, which is crucial for developing embodied AI within 3D scenes, such as visual navigation and embodied question answering. Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |

Generalizing ObjectNav to Dynamic Environments with Portable Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09905v2)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ObjectNav is a popular task in Embodied AI, where an agent navigates to a target object in an unseen environment. Prior literature makes the assumption of a static environment with stationary objects, which lacks realism. To address this, we present a novel formulation to generalize ObjectNav to dynamic environments with non-stationary objects, and refer to it as Portable ObjectNav or P-ObjectNav. In our formulation, we first address several challenging issues with dynamizing existing topological scene graphs by developing a novel method that introduces multiple transition behaviors to portable objects in the scene. We use this technique to dynamize Matterport3D, a popular simulator for evaluating embodied tasks. We then present a benchmark for P-ObjectNav using a combination of heuristic, reinforcement learning, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based navigation approaches on the dynamized environment, while introducing novel evaluation metrics tailored for our task. Our work fundamentally challenges the "static-environment" notion of prior ObjectNav work; the code and dataset for P-ObjectNav will be made publicly available to foster research on embodied navigation in dynamic scenes. We provide an anonymized repository for our code and dataset: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PObjectNav-1C6D.</p></details> | 19 |

However, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning task. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant under-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward model and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment performance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated Human Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and demonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach admits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and leverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy Optimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment pipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with extensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially when the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[EARBench: Towards Evaluating Physical Risk Awareness for Task Planning of Foundation Model-based Embodied AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04449v5)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) integrates advanced AI models into physical entities for real-world interaction. The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EARBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EARDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

Representative artificial neural networks in these fields span convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and deep Q-networks. Built upon unimodal neural networks, numerous multi-modal models have been introduced to address a range of tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and speech recognition. The rise of instruction-following robotic policies in embodied AI has spurred the development of a novel category of multi-modal models known as vision-language-action models (VLAs). Their multi-modality capability has become a foundational element in robot learning. Various methods have been proposed to enhance traits such as versatility, dexterity, and generalizability. Some models focus on refining specific components. Others aim to develop control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. Certain VLAs serve as high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into executable subtasks. Over the past few years, a myriad of VLAs have emerged, reflecting the rapid advancement of embodied AI. Therefore, it is imperative to capture the evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, a survey of vision-language-action models</p></details> |

However, when powered with open large language models (LLMs), these agents often struggle with rudimentary tasks, even when fine-tuned on domain-specific knowledge. Inspired by human cultural learning, we present \collabvoyager, a novel framework that enhances Voyager with lifelong collaborative learning through explicit perspective-taking. \collabvoyager introduces three key innovations: (1) theory of mind representations linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural language communication between agents; and (3) semantic memory of task and environment knowledge and episodic memory of collaboration episodes. These advancements enable agents to reason about their and others' mental states, empirically addressing two prevalent failure modes: false beliefs and faulty task executions. In mixed-expertise Minecraft experiments, \collabvoyager agents outperform Voyager counterparts, significantly improving task completion rate by $66.6\% (+39.4\%)$ for collecting one block of dirt and $70.8\% (+20.8\%)$ for collecting one wood block. They exhibit emergent behaviors like knowledge transfer from expert to novice agents and collaborative code correction. \collabvoyager agents also demonstrate the ability to adapt to out-of-distribution tasks by using their previous experiences and beliefs obtained through collaboration. In this open-ended social learning paradigm, \collabvoyager paves the way for the democratic development of embodied AI, where agents learn in deployment from both peer and environmental feedback.</p></details> |  |

However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downstream tasks. Image-to-video diffusion models are already capable of generating highly realistic synthetic videos. However, these models are not action-conditioned, and the most powerful models are closed-source which means they cannot be finetuned. In this work, we propose to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to action-conditioned world models, without access to the parameters of the pretrained model. Our approach, AVID, trains an adapter on a small domain-specific dataset of action-labelled videos. AVID uses a learned mask to modify the intermediate outputs of the pretrained model and generate accurate action-conditioned videos. We evaluate AVID on video game and real-world robotics data, and show that it outperforms existing baselines for diffusion model adaptation.1 Our results demonstrate that if utilized correctly, pretrained video models have the potential to be powerful tools for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/avid-world-model-adapters/home</p></details> |

In this study, we introduce ROOT, a VLM-based system designed to enhance the analysis of indoor scenes. Specifically, we first develop an iterative object perception algorithm using GPT-4V to detect object entities within indoor scenes. This is followed by employing vision foundation models to acquire additional meta-information about the scene, such as bounding boxes. Building on this foundational data, we propose a specialized VLM, SceneVLM, which is capable of generating spatial hierarchical scene graphs and providing distance information for objects within indoor environments. This information enhances our understanding of the spatial arrangement of indoor scenes. To train our SceneVLM, we collect over 610,000 images from various public indoor datasets and implement a scene data generation pipeline with a semi-automated technique to establish relationships and estimate distances among indoor objects. By utilizing this enriched data, we conduct various training recipes and finish SceneVLM. Our experiments demonstrate that \rootname facilitates indoor scene understanding and proves effective in diverse downstream applications, such as 3D scene generation and embodied AI.

| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs and 3D segmentation masks. In addition, we design MORE3D, a simple yet effective method that enables multi-object 3D reasoning segmentation with user questions and textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative World Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

| **[Software-Hardware Co-Design For Embodied AI Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04292v4)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI robots have the potential to fundamentally improve the way human beings live and manufacture. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame-basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes Corki, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI robot control. Our idea is to decouple LLM inference, robotic control and data communication in the embodied AI robots compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, Corki predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. Corki largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to 8.0x, resulting in up to 3.6x speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 17.3%. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/hyy0613/Corki</p></details> |  |

Generated models frequently fail to maintain balance when placed in physics-based simulations or 3D printed. This balance is crucial for satisfying user design intentions in interactive gaming, embodied AI, and robotics, where stable models are needed for reliable interaction. Additionally, stable models ensure that 3D-printed objects, such as figurines for home decoration, can stand on their own without requiring additional supports. To fill this gap, we introduce Atlas3D, an automatic and easy-to-implement method that enhances existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D tools. Atlas3D ensures the generation of self-supporting 3D models that adhere to physical laws of stability under gravity, contact, and friction. Our approach combines a novel differentiable simulation-based loss function with physically inspired regularization, serving as either a refinement or a post-processing module for existing frameworks. We verify Atlas3D's efficacy through extensive generation tasks and validate the resulting 3D models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunuoch.github.io/Atlas3D/</p></details> |

Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing Architect, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene. This iterative structure brings the flexibility for our method to generate or refine scenes from various starting points, such as text, floor plans, or pre-arranged environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Models in Vision: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05902v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive modeling has been a huge success in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, \textit{i.e.}, pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the strategy of representation. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multi-faceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multi-modal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: \url{https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey}.</p></details> |  |

Scene Retrieval with Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14565v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interfaces to embodied AI are becoming more ubiquitous in our daily lives. This opens up further opportunities for language-based interaction with embodied agents, such as a user verbally instructing an agent to execute some task in a specific location. For example, "put the bowls back in the cupboard next to the fridge" or "meet me at the intersection under the red sign." As such, we need methods that interface between natural language and map representations of the environment. To this end, we explore the question of whether we can use an open-set natural language query to identify a scene represented by a 3D scene graph. We define this task as "language-based scene-retrieval" and it is closely related to "coarse-localization," but we are instead searching for a match from a collection of disjoint scenes and not necessarily a large-scale continuous map. We present Text2SceneGraphMatcher, a "scene-retrieval" pipeline that learns joint embeddings between text descriptions and scene graphs to determine if they are a match. The code, trained models, and datasets will be made public.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

However, current VLN frameworks often rely on static environments and optimal expert supervision, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation (HA-VLN), extending traditional VLN by incorporating dynamic human activities and relaxing key assumptions.

A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability.

Our system is modular: it deploys state of the art Large Language Models for task planning,Vision-Language models for semantic perception, and Point Cloud transformers for grasping. With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities. One may also in-place swap modules to improve the robustness of the overall platform, for instance with imitation-learned policies.

At present, many evaluation platforms with rich scenes, high visual fidelity and various application scenarios have been developed. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework named NeuronsGym that can be used for policy learning of robot tasks, covering a simulation platform for training policy, and a physical system for studying sim2real problems. Unlike most current single-task, slow-moving robotic platforms, our framework provides agile physical robots with a wider range of speeds, and can be employed to train robotic navigation and confrontation policies. At the same time, in order to evaluate the safety of robot navigation, we propose a safety-weighted path length (SFPL) to improve the safety evaluation in the current mobile robot navigation. Based on this platform, we build a new benchmark for navigation and confrontation tasks under this platform by comparing the current mainstream sim2real methods, and hold the 2022 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) RoboMaster sim2real challenge. We release the codes of this framework\footnote{\url{https://github.com/DRL-CASIA/NeuronsGym}} and hope that this platform can promote the development of more flexible and agile general mobile agent algorithms.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

One notably promising application of LLM agents is robotic manipulation. Recent research has shown that LLMs can generate text planning or control code for robots, providing substantial flexibility and interaction capabilities. However, these methods still face challenges in terms of flexibility and applicability across different environments, limiting their ability to adapt autonomously. Current approaches typically fall into two categories: those relying on environment-specific policy training, which restricts their transferability, and those generating code actions based on fixed prompts, which leads to diminished performance when confronted with new environments. These limitations significantly constrain the generalizability of agents in robotic manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called EnvBridge. This approach involves the retention and transfer of successful robot control codes from source environments to target environments. EnvBridge enhances the agent's adaptability and performance across diverse settings by leveraging insights from multiple environments. Notably, our approach alleviates environmental constraints, offering a more flexible and generalizable solution for robotic manipulation tasks. We validated the effectiveness of our method using robotic manipulation benchmarks: RLBench, MetaWorld, and CALVIN. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully leverage diverse knowledge sources to solve complex tasks. Consequently, our approach significantly enhances the adaptability and robustness of robotic manipulation agents in planning across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

When integrated into an embodied agent, existing embodied VLM works either output detailed action sequences at the manipulation level or only provide plans at an abstract level, leaving a gap between high-level planning and real-world manipulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octopus, an embodied vision-language programmer that uses executable code generation as a medium to connect planning and manipulation. Octopus is designed to 1) proficiently comprehend an agent's visual and textual task objectives, 2) formulate intricate action sequences, and 3) generate executable code. To facilitate Octopus model development, we introduce OctoVerse: a suite of environments tailored for benchmarking vision-based code generators on a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games such as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Minecraft. To train Octopus, we leverage GPT-4 to control an explorative agent that generates training data, i.e., action blueprints and corresponding executable code. We also collect feedback that enables an enhanced training scheme called Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF).

| **[Multi-LLM QA with Embodied Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10918v5)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have grown in popularity due to their natural language interface and pre trained knowledge, leading to rapidly increasing success in question-answering (QA) tasks. More recently, multi-agent systems with LLM-based agents (Multi-LLM) have been utilized increasingly more for QA. In these scenarios, the models may each answer the question and reach a consensus or each model is specialized to answer different domain questions. However, most prior work dealing with Multi-LLM QA has focused on scenarios where the models are asked in a zero-shot manner or are given information sources to extract the answer. For question answering of an unknown environment, embodied exploration of the environment is first needed to answer the question. This skill is necessary for personalizing embodied AI to environments such as households. There is a lack of insight into whether a Multi-LLM system can handle question-answering based on observations from embodied exploration. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the use of Multi-Embodied LLM Explorers (MELE) for QA in an unknown environment. Multiple LLM-based agents independently explore and then answer queries about a household environment. We analyze different aggregation methods to generate a single, final answer for each query: debating, majority voting, and training a central answer module (CAM). Using CAM, we observe a $46\%$ higher accuracy compared against the other non-learning-based aggregation methods. We provide code and the query dataset for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Through this unified latent action space, IGOR enables knowledge transfer among large-scale robot and human activity data. We achieve this by compressing visual changes between an initial image and its goal state into latent actions. IGOR allows us to generate latent action labels for internet-scale video data. This unified latent action space enables the training of foundation policy and world models across a wide variety of tasks performed by both robots and humans. We demonstrate that: (1) IGOR learns a semantically consistent action space for both human and robots, characterizing various possible motions of objects representing the physical interaction knowledge; (2) IGOR can "migrate" the movements of the object in the one video to other videos, even across human and robots, by jointly using the latent action model and world model; (3) IGOR can learn to align latent actions with natural language through the foundation policy model, and integrate latent actions with a low-level policy model to achieve effective robot control. We believe IGOR opens new possibilities for human-to-robot knowledge transfer and control.</p></details> |  |

BestMan introduces an integrated multilevel skill chain for seamless coordination across perception, planning, and control; a highly modular architecture for flexible algorithm integration; unified interfaces for smooth simulation-to-reality transfer; and a hardware-agnostic approach for adapting to various mobile manipulator configurations.

Majority of prior arts adhere to an open-loop philosophy and lack real-time feedback, leading to error accumulation and undesirable robustness. A handful of approaches have endeavored to establish feedback mechanisms leveraging pixel-level differences or pre-trained visual representations, yet their efficacy and adaptability have been found to be constrained. Inspired by classic closed-loop control systems, we propose CLOVER, a closed-loop visuomotor control framework that incorporates feedback mechanisms to improve adaptive robotic control. CLOVER consists of a text-conditioned video diffusion model for generating visual plans as reference inputs, a measurable embedding space for accurate error quantification, and a feedback-driven controller that refines actions from feedback and initiates replans as needed. Our framework exhibits notable advancement in real-world robotic tasks and achieves state-of-the-art on CALVIN benchmark, improving by 8% over previous open-loop counterparts.

Building on previous work, EgoThink, we introduce VidEgoThink, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating egocentric video understanding capabilities. To bridge the gap between MLLMs and low-level control in Embodied AI, we design four key interrelated tasks: video question-answering, hierarchy planning, visual grounding and reward modeling. To minimize manual annotation costs, we develop an automatic data generation pipeline based on the Ego4D dataset, leveraging the prior knowledge and multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o. Three human annotators then filter the generated data to ensure diversity and quality, resulting in the VidEgoThink benchmark. We conduct extensive experiments with three types of models: API-based MLLMs, open-source image-based MLLMs, and open-source video-based MLLMs. Experimental results indicate that all MLLMs, including GPT-4o, perform poorly across all tasks related to egocentric video understanding. These findings suggest that foundation models still require significant advancements to be effectively applied to first-person scenarios in Embodied AI. In conclusion, VidEgoThink reflects a research trend towards employing MLLMs for egocentric vision, akin to human capabilities, enabling active observation and interaction in the complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[M2Diffuser: Diffusion-based Trajectory Optimization for Mobile Manipulation in 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11402v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have opened new avenues for research into embodied AI agents and robotics. Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation-a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation-remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[EgoChoir: Capturing 3D Human-Object Interaction Regions from Egocentric Views](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13659v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding egocentric human-object interaction (HOI) is a fundamental aspect of human-centric perception, facilitating applications like AR/VR and embodied AI. For the egocentric HOI, in addition to perceiving semantics e.g., ''what'' interaction is occurring, capturing ''where'' the interaction specifically manifests in 3D space is also crucial, which links the perception and operation. Existing methods primarily leverage observations of HOI to capture interaction regions from an exocentric view. However, incomplete observations of interacting parties in the egocentric view introduce ambiguity between visual observations and interaction contents, impairing their efficacy. From the egocentric view, humans integrate the visual cortex, cerebellum, and brain to internalize their intentions and interaction concepts of objects, allowing for the pre-formulation of interactions and making behaviors even when interaction regions are out of sight. In light of this, we propose harmonizing the visual appearance, head motion, and 3D object to excavate the object interaction concept and subject intention, jointly inferring 3D human contact and object affordance from egocentric videos. To achieve this, we present EgoChoir, which links object structures with interaction contexts inherent in appearance and head motion to reveal object affordance, further utilizing it to model human contact. Additionally, a gradient modulation is employed to adopt appropriate clues for capturing interaction regions across various egocentric scenarios. Moreover, 3D contact and affordance are annotated for egocentric videos collected from Ego-Exo4D and GIMO to support the task. Extensive experiments on them demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of EgoChoir.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2024, project: https://yyvhang.github.io/EgoChoir/</p></details> |

Accomplishing this goal requires learning to ground language in perception and embodied actions, in order to accomplish complex tasks. The Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project tackles this by training agents to follow free-form instructions across a diverse range of virtual 3D environments, including curated research environments as well as open-ended, commercial video games. Our goal is to develop an instructable agent that can accomplish anything a human can do in any simulated 3D environment. Our approach focuses on language-driven generality while imposing minimal assumptions. Our agents interact with environments in real-time using a generic, human-like interface: the inputs are image observations and language instructions and the outputs are keyboard-and-mouse actions. This general approach is challenging, but it allows agents to ground language across many visually complex and semantically rich environments while also allowing us to readily run agents in new environments. In this paper we describe our motivation and goal, the initial progress we have made, and promising preliminary results on several diverse research environments and a variety of commercial video games.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Robotics and Embodied AI make public urban spaces no longer exclusive to humans. Food delivery bots and electric wheelchairs have started sharing sidewalks with pedestrians, while robot dogs and humanoids have recently emerged in the street. Micromobility enabled by AI for short-distance travel in public urban spaces plays a crucial component in the future transportation system. Ensuring the generalizability and safety of AI models maneuvering mobile machines is essential. In this work, we present MetaUrban, a compositional simulation platform for the AI-driven urban micromobility research. MetaUrban can construct an infinite number of interactive urban scenes from compositional elements, covering a vast array of ground plans, object placements, pedestrians, vulnerable road users, and other mobile agents' appearances and dynamics. We design point navigation and social navigation tasks as the pilot study using MetaUrban for urban micromobility research and establish various baselines of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. We conduct extensive evaluation across mobile machines, demonstrating that heterogeneous mechanical structures significantly influence the learning and execution of AI policies. We perform a thorough ablation study, showing that the compositional nature of the simulated environments can substantially improve the generalizability and safety of the trained mobile agents. MetaUrban will be made publicly available to provide research opportunities and foster safe and trustworthy embodied AI and micromobility in cities.

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

Hand motion models with the sophistication to accurately recreate piano playing have a wide range of applications in character animation, embodied AI, biomechanics, and VR/AR. In this paper, we construct a first-of-its-kind large-scale dataset that contains approximately 10 hours of 3D hand motion and audio from 15 elite-level pianists playing 153 pieces of classical music. To capture natural performances, we designed a markerless setup in which motions are reconstructed from multi-view videos using state-of-the-art pose estimation models. The motion data is further refined via inverse kinematics using the high-resolution MIDI key-pressing data obtained from sensors in a specialized Yamaha Disklavier piano. Leveraging the collected dataset, we developed a pipeline that can synthesize physically-plausible hand motions for musical scores outside of the dataset. Our approach employs a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning to obtain policies for physics-based bimanual control involving the interaction between hands and piano keys. To solve the sampling efficiency problem with the large motion dataset, we use a diffusion model to generate natural reference motions, which provide high-level trajectory and fingering (finger order and placement) information. However, the generated reference motion alone does not provide sufficient accuracy for piano performance modeling. We then further augmented the data by using musical similarity to retrieve similar motions from the captured dataset to boost the precision of the RL policy. With the proposed method, our model generates natural, dexterous motions that generalize to music from outside the training dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2024.

| **[Learning the Generalizable Manipulation Skills on Soft-body Tasks via Guided Self-attention Behavior Cloning Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05756v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI represents a paradigm in AI research where artificial agents are situated within and interact with physical or virtual environments. Despite the recent progress in Embodied AI, it is still very challenging to learn the generalizable manipulation skills that can handle large deformation and topological changes on soft-body objects, such as clay, water, and soil. In this work, we proposed an effective policy, namely GP2E behavior cloning policy, which can guide the agent to learn the generalizable manipulation skills from soft-body tasks, including pouring, filling, hanging, excavating, pinching, and writing. Concretely, we build our policy from three insights:(1) Extracting intricate semantic features from point cloud data and seamlessly integrating them into the robot's end-effector frame; (2) Capturing long-distance interactions in long-horizon tasks through the incorporation of our guided self-attention module; (3) Mitigating overfitting concerns and facilitating model convergence to higher accuracy levels via the introduction of our two-stage fine-tuning strategy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving the 1st prize in the soft-body track of the ManiSkill2 Challenge at the CVPR 2023 4th Embodied AI workshop. Our findings highlight the potential of our method to improve the generalization abilities of Embodied AI models and pave the way for their practical applications in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-Aware Transformer Networks for Robotic Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02669v2)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research in Visual Navigation reveals opportunities for improvement. First, the direct adoption of RNNs and Transformers often overlooks the specific differences between Embodied AI and traditional sequential data modelling, potentially limiting its performance in Embodied AI tasks. Second, the reliance on task-specific configurations, such as pre-trained modules and dataset-specific logic, compromises the generalizability of these methods. We address these constraints by initially exploring the unique differences between Navigation tasks and other sequential data tasks through the lens of Causality, presenting a causal framework to elucidate the inadequacies of conventional sequential methods for Navigation. By leveraging this causal perspective, we propose Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) Networks for Navigation, featuring a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the models's Environmental Understanding capability. Meanwhile, our method is devoid of task-specific inductive biases and can be trained in an End-to-End manner, which enhances the method's generalizability across various contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology consistently surpasses benchmark performances across a spectrum of settings, tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablation studies reveal that the performance gains can be attributed to the Causal Understanding Module, which demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in both Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning settings.</p></details> |  |

Exploring Backdoor Attacks against Embodied LLM-based Decision-Making Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20774v2)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in real-world decision-making tasks for embodied artificial intelligence, especially when fine-tuned to leverage their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities while being tailored to specific applications. However, this fine-tuning process introduces considerable safety and security vulnerabilities, especially in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-based Decision-making systems (BALD) in embodied AI, systematically exploring the attack surfaces and trigger mechanisms. Specifically, we propose three distinct attack mechanisms: word injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection, targeting various components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline. We perform extensive experiments on representative LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2) in autonomous driving and home robot tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and stealthiness of our backdoor triggers across various attack channels, with cases like vehicles accelerating toward obstacles and robots placing knives on beds. Our word and knowledge injection attacks achieve nearly 100% success rate across multiple models and datasets while requiring only limited access to the system. Our scenario manipulation attack yields success rates exceeding 65%, reaching up to 90%, and does not require any runtime system intrusion. We also assess the robustness of these attacks against defenses, revealing their resilience. Our findings highlight critical security vulnerabilities in embodied LLM systems and emphasize the urgent need for safeguarding these systems to mitigate potential risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, including main paper, references, and appendix</p></details> |

However, there is still lack of study on how vision language models~(VLMs) behave when multi-modal task inputs are considered. Counterfactual planning that evaluates the model's reasoning ability over alternative task situations are also under exploited. In order to evaluate the planning ability of both multi-modal and counterfactual aspects, we propose ActPlan-1K. ActPlan-1K is a multi-modal planning benchmark constructed based on ChatGPT and household activity simulator iGibson2. The benchmark consists of 153 activities and 1,187 instances. Each instance describing one activity has a natural language task description and multiple environment images from the simulator. The gold plan of each instance is action sequences over the objects in provided scenes. Both the correctness and commonsense satisfaction are evaluated on typical VLMs. It turns out that current VLMs are still struggling at generating human-level procedural plans for both normal activities and counterfactual activities. We further provide automatic evaluation metrics by finetuning over BLEURT model to facilitate future research on our benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables, accepted to EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

With the advancement of embodied AI, robots are increasingly capable of satisfying human demands. Demand-driven navigation (DDN) is a task in which an agent must locate an object to satisfy a specified demand instruction, such as ``I am thirsty.'' The previous study typically assumes that each demand instruction requires only one object to be fulfilled and does not consider individual preferences. However, the realistic human demand may involve multiple objects. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-object Demand-driven Navigation (MO-DDN) benchmark, which addresses these nuanced aspects, including multi-object search and personal preferences, thus making the MO-DDN task more reflective of real-life scenarios compared to DDN. Building upon previous work, we employ the concept of ``attribute'' to tackle this new task. However, instead of solely relying on attribute features in an end-to-end manner like DDN, we propose a modular method that involves constructing a coarse-to-fine attribute-based exploration agent (C2FAgent). Our experimental results illustrate that this coarse-to-fine exploration strategy capitalizes on the advantages of attributes at various decision-making levels, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods.

For instance, a robot in an unfamiliar house initially wouldn't know the locations of objects needed for tasks and might perform inefficiently. However, as it gathers more experience, it should learn the layout of its environment and remember where objects are, allowing it to complete new tasks more efficiently. To enable such rapid adaptation to new tasks, we present ReLIC, a new approach for in-context reinforcement learning (RL) for embodied agents. With ReLIC, agents are capable of adapting to new environments using 64,000 steps of in-context experience with full attention while being trained through self-generated experience via RL. We achieve this by proposing a novel policy update scheme for on-policy RL called "partial updates'' as well as a Sink-KV mechanism that enables effective utilization of a long observation history for embodied agents. Our method outperforms a variety of meta-RL baselines in adapting to unseen houses in an embodied multi-object navigation task. In addition, we find that ReLIC is capable of few-shot imitation learning despite never being trained with expert demonstrations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of ReLIC, highlighting that the combination of large-scale RL training, the proposed partial updates scheme, and the Sink-KV are essential for effective in-context learning.

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.

However, real-world datasets often contain insufficient data to meet the training and evaluation requirements of models. Although synthetic datasets offer a larger volume of data, their acoustic simulations lack realism. Consequently, neither real-world nor synthetic datasets effectively fulfill practical needs. To address these issues, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit de-designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim is developed based on the embodied AI simulation platform, Habitat-sim, supporting multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level, thereby generating more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a moving sound source benchmark dataset, SonicSet, using the Librispeech, the Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K) and Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from the Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to validate the differences between synthetic data and real-world data, we randomly selected 5 hours of raw data without reverberation from the SonicSet validation set to record a real-world speech separation dataset, which was then compared with the corresponding synthetic datasets. Similarly, we utilized the real-world speech enhancement dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between other synthetic datasets and the SonicSet dataset for speech enhancement. The results indicate that the synthetic data generated by SonicSim can effectively generalize to real-world scenarios.

This evolution has led to the development of the Vehicular Embodied AI NETwork (VEANET), where advanced AI capabilities are integrated into vehicular systems to enhance autonomous operations and decision-making. Embodied agents, such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are autonomous entities that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals, actively interacting with the physical world. Embodied twins are digital models of these embodied agents, with various embodied AI twins for intelligent applications in cyberspace. In VEANET, embodied AI twins act as in-vehicle AI assistants to perform diverse tasks supporting autonomous driving using generative AI models. Due to limited computational resources of AVs, these AVs often offload computationally intensive tasks, such as constructing and updating embodied AI twins, to nearby RSUs. However, since the rapid mobility of AVs and the limited provision coverage of a single RSU, embodied AI twins require dynamic migrations from current RSU to other RSUs in real-time, resulting in the challenge of selecting suitable RSUs for efficient embodied AI twins migrations. Given information asymmetry, AVs cannot know the detailed information of RSUs. To this end, in this paper, we construct a multi-dimensional contract theoretical model between AVs and alternative RSUs. Considering that AVs may exhibit irrational behavior, we utilize prospect theory instead of expected utility theory to model the actual utilities of AVs. Finally, we employ a generative diffusion model-based algorithm to identify the optimal contract designs. Compared with traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p></details> |  |

We propose a direct yet effective method of monitoring the robot's current plan to detect changes in the environment that impact the intended trajectory of the robot significantly and then query a human for feedback. We also develop a means to parse human feedback expressed in natural language into local navigation waypoints and integrate it into a global planning system, by leveraging a map of semantic features and an aligned obstacle map. Extensive testing in simulation and physical hardware experiments with a resource-constrained wheeled robot tasked to navigate in a real-world environment validate the efficacy and robustness of our method. This work can support applications like precision agriculture and construction, where persistent monitoring of the environment provides a human with information about the environment state.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we aim to achieve both high model performance and practical deployability. Specifically, we focus on Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), a core task in Embodied AI. This paper introduces a two-stage knowledge distillation framework, producing a student model, MiniVLN, and showcasing the significant potential of distillation techniques in developing lightweight models. The proposed method aims to capture fine-grained knowledge during the pretraining phase and navigation-specific knowledge during the fine-tuning phase. Our findings indicate that the two-stage distillation approach is more effective in narrowing the performance gap between the teacher model and the student model compared to single-stage distillation. On the public R2R and REVERIE benchmarks, MiniVLN achieves performance on par with the teacher model while having only about 12% of the teacher model's parameter count.</p></details> |  |

On small form-factor devices, e.g., nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such challenges are exacerbated by stringent constraints on energy efficiency and weight. In this paper, we explore embodied multi-modal AI-based perception for Nano-UAVs with the Kraken shield, a 7g multi-sensor (frame-based and event-based imagers) board based on Kraken, a 22 nm SoC featuring multiple acceleration engines for multi-modal event and frame-based inference based on spiking (SNN) and ternary (TNN) neural networks, respectively. Kraken can execute SNN real-time inference for depth estimation at 1.02k inf/s, 18 {\mu}J/inf, TNN real-time inference for object classification at 10k inf/s, 6 {\mu}J/inf, and real-time inference for obstacle avoidance at 221 frame/s, 750 {\mu}J/inf.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

While Next Best View (NBV) planning and Learning-based approaches offer solutions, they are often limited by predefined criteria and fail to manage occlusions with human-like common sense. To address these problems, we present AIR-Embodied, a novel framework that integrates embodied AI agents with large-scale pretrained multi-modal language models to improve active 3DGS reconstruction. AIR-Embodied utilizes a three-stage process: understanding the current reconstruction state via multi-modal prompts, planning tasks with viewpoint selection and interactive actions, and employing closed-loop reasoning to ensure accurate execution. The agent dynamically refines its actions based on discrepancies between the planned and actual outcomes. Experimental evaluations across virtual and real-world environments demonstrate that AIR-Embodied significantly enhances reconstruction efficiency and quality, providing a robust solution to challenges in active 3D reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

To accomplish long-horizon tasks, agents need to decompose abstract instructions into detailed steps. Prior works mostly rely on GPT-4V for task decomposition into predefined actions, which limits task diversity due to GPT-4V's finite understanding of larger skillsets. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a groundbreaking framework for Real world Long-horizon Embodied Planning, which can accomplish a wide range of daily tasks. At its core lies a fine-tuned large vision language model that formulates plans as sequences of skill functions according to input instruction and scene image. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a semi-automatic data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. Real-world off-line experiments across eight daily embodied tasks demonstrate that ReLEP is able to accomplish long-horizon embodied tasks and outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[KARMA: Augmenting Embodied AI Agents with Long-and-short Term Memory Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14908v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI agents responsible for executing interconnected, long-sequence household tasks often face difficulties with in-context memory, leading to inefficiencies and errors in task execution. To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KARMA's plug-and-play capability allows for seamless deployment on real-world robotic systems, such as mobile manipulation platforms.Through this plug-and-play memory system, KARMA significantly enhances the ability of embodied agents to generate coherent and contextually appropriate plans, making the execution of complex household tasks more efficient.

This task introduces distinct challenges in multimodal comprehension, spatial reasoning, and decision-making. To address these challenges, we introduce Cog-GA, a generative agent founded on large language models (LLMs) tailored for VLN-CE tasks. Cog-GA employs a dual-pronged strategy to emulate human-like cognitive processes. Firstly, it constructs a cognitive map, integrating temporal, spatial, and semantic elements, thereby facilitating the development of spatial memory within LLMs. Secondly, Cog-GA employs a predictive mechanism for waypoints, strategically optimizing the exploration trajectory to maximize navigational efficiency. Each waypoint is accompanied by a dual-channel scene description, categorizing environmental cues into 'what' and 'where' streams as the brain. This segregation enhances the agent's attentional focus, enabling it to discern pertinent spatial information for navigation. A reflective mechanism complements these strategies by capturing feedback from prior navigation experiences, facilitating continual learning and adaptive replanning. Extensive evaluations conducted on VLN-CE benchmarks validate Cog-GA's state-of-the-art performance and ability to simulate human-like navigation behaviors. This research significantly contributes to the development of strategic and interpretable VLN-CE agents.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose SpatialBot for better spatial understanding by feeding both RGB and depth images. Additionally, we have constructed the SpatialQA dataset, which involves multi-level depth-related questions to train VLMs for depth understanding. Finally, we present SpatialBench to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' capabilities in spatial understanding at different levels. Extensive experiments on our spatial-understanding benchmark, general VLM benchmarks and Embodied AI tasks, demonstrate the remarkable improvements of SpatialBot trained on SpatialQA.

| **[P-RAG: Progressive Retrieval Augmented Generation For Planning on Embodied Everyday Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11279v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Everyday Task is a popular task in the embodied AI community, requiring agents to make a sequence of actions based on natural language instructions and visual observations. Traditional learning-based approaches face two challenges. Firstly, natural language instructions often lack explicit task planning. Secondly, extensive training is required to equip models with knowledge of the task environment. Previous works based on Large Language Model (LLM) either suffer from poor performance due to the lack of task-specific knowledge or rely on ground truth as few-shot samples. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel approach called Progressive Retrieval Augmented Generation (P-RAG), which not only effectively leverages the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs but also progressively accumulates task-specific knowledge without ground-truth. Compared to the conventional RAG methods, which retrieve relevant information from the database in a one-shot manner to assist generation, P-RAG introduces an iterative approach to progressively update the database. In each iteration, P-RAG retrieves the latest database and obtains historical information from the previous interaction as experiential references for the current interaction. Moreover, we also introduce a more granular retrieval scheme that not only retrieves similar tasks but also incorporates retrieval of similar situations to provide more valuable reference experiences. Extensive experiments reveal that P-RAG achieves competitive results without utilizing ground truth and can even further improve performance through self-iterations.</p></details> |  |

However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://tianzhechu.com/SFTvsRL</p></details> |

Constitutional AI (CAI) offers an explicit, rule-based framework for guiding model outputs. Building on this, we refine the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) algorithm, which extracts constitutions from preference datasets. By improving principle generation, clustering, and embedding processes, our approach enhances the accuracy and generalizability of extracted principles across synthetic and real-world datasets. While in-context alignment yields modest improvements, our results highlight the potential of these principles to foster more transparent and adaptable alignment methods, offering a promising direction for future advancements beyond traditional fine-tuning.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 3 Figures |

The method accomplishes this by combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), guided by a step-level value model that rewards moderate surprisal (curiosity) while penalizing incoherence, and Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to fine-tune the policy on high-value plot expansions. This iterative reinforcement learning loop systematically explores multiple candidate plot branches, backpropagates quality signals, and adapts the policy for faster convergence, notably shifting the policy from puzzle-based Chain-of-Thought to more character-driven storytelling. In small-scale tests with short-story prompts, 67%-77% of participants favored COS(M+O)S's highest-rated expansions over lower-rated ones, suggesting that our learned value function aligns. GPT-4o ratings further show that COS(M+O)S surpasses naive single-pass decoding from Llama 3.2 3B by 0.59 SD, coming within 0.06 SD of Llama 3.1 70B (no significant difference, p=0.93). Pairwise comparisons with o1 place COS(M+O)S 1.5 SD above the 3B baseline and find no statistically significant gap from 70B. Nevertheless, absolute story quality remains modest, constrained by the small model's capacity and limited training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Mean Field Control on Sparse Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17079v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large agent networks are abundant in applications and nature and pose difficult challenges in the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) due to their computational and theoretical complexity. While graphon mean field games and their extensions provide efficient learning algorithms for dense and moderately sparse agent networks, the case of realistic sparser graphs remains largely unsolved. Thus, we propose a novel mean field control model inspired by local weak convergence to include sparse graphs such as power law networks with coefficients above two. Besides a theoretical analysis, we design scalable learning algorithms which apply to the challenging class of graph sequences with finite first moment. We compare our model and algorithms for various examples on synthetic and real world networks with mean field algorithms based on Lp graphons and graphexes. As it turns out, our approach outperforms existing methods in many examples and on various networks due to the special design aiming at an important, but so far hard to solve class of MARL problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Induced Modularity and Community Detection for Functionally Interpretable Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17077v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretability in reinforcement learning is crucial for ensuring AI systems align with human values and fulfill the diverse related requirements including safety, robustness and fairness. Building on recent approaches to encouraging sparsity and locality in neural networks, we demonstrate how the penalisation of non-local weights leads to the emergence of functionally independent modules in the policy network of a reinforcement learning agent. To illustrate this, we demonstrate the emergence of two parallel modules for assessment of movement along the X and Y axes in a stochastic Minigrid environment. Through the novel application of community detection algorithms, we show how these modules can be automatically identified and their functional roles verified through direct intervention on the network weights prior to inference. This establishes a scalable framework for reinforcement learning interpretability through functional modularity, addressing challenges regarding the trade-off between completeness and cognitive tractability of reinforcement learning explanations.</p></details> |  |

However, ensuring harmlessness in these systems remains a critical challenge, particularly in advanced models like DeepSeek-R1. This paper examines the limitations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the primary approach for reducing harmful outputs in DeepSeek-R1 and compares it with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While RL improves reasoning capabilities, it faces challenges such as reward hacking, generalization failures, language mixing, and high computational costs. We propose hybrid training approaches combining RL and SFT to achieve robust harmlessness reduction. Usage recommendations and future directions for deploying DeepSeek-R1 responsibly are also presented.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 table |

In this space, electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) perform a variety of tasks to improve aviation safety and efficiency, such as collaborative computing and perception. However, eVTOLs face constraints such as compacted shape and restricted onboard computing resources. These limitations necessitate task offloading to nearby high-performance base stations (BSs) for timely processing. Unfortunately, the high mobility of eVTOLs, coupled with their restricted flight airlines and heterogeneous resource management creates significant challenges in dynamic task offloading. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel network slice-based Low-Altitude Intelligent Network (LAIN) framework for eVTOL tasks. By leveraging advanced network slicing technologies from 5G/6G, the proposed framework dynamically adjusts communication bandwidth, beam alignment, and computing resources to meet fluctuating task demands. Specifically, the framework includes an access pairing method to pre-schedule optimal eVTOL-BS-slice assignments, a pre-assessment algorithm to avoid resource waste, and a deep reinforcement learning-based slice orchestration mechanism to optimize resource allocation and lifecycle management. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of resource allocation efficiency and operational/violation costs across varying eVTOL velocities. This work provides valuable insights into intelligent network slicing for future AAM transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Control of Non-Markovian Cellular Population Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08439v3)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many organisms and cell types, from bacteria to cancer cells, exhibit a remarkable ability to adapt to fluctuating environments. Additionally, cells can leverage a memory of past environments to better survive previously-encountered stressors. From a control perspective, this adaptability poses significant challenges in driving cell populations toward extinction, and thus poses an open question with great clinical significance. In this work, we focus on drug dosing in cell populations exhibiting phenotypic plasticity. For specific dynamical models switching between resistant and susceptible states, exact solutions are known. However, when the underlying system parameters are unknown, and for complex memory-based systems, obtaining the optimal solution is currently intractable. To address this challenge, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to identify informed dosing strategies to control cell populations evolving under novel non-Markovian dynamics. We find that model-free deep RL is able to recover exact solutions and control cell populations even in the presence of long-range temporal dynamics. To further test our approach in more realistic settings, we demonstrate robust RL-based control strategies in environments with measurement noise and dynamic memory strength.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

We focus on agents that respond solely to odor stimuli, with no access to spatial perception nor prior information about the odor. We ask whether navigation to a target can be learned robustly within a sequential decision making framework. We develop a reinforcement learning algorithm using a small set of interpretable olfactory states and train it with realistic turbulent odor cues. By introducing a temporal memory, we demonstrate that two salient features of odor traces, discretized in few olfactory states, are sufficient to learn navigation in a realistic odor plume. Performance is dictated by the sparse nature of turbulent odors. An optimal memory exists which ignores blanks within the plume and activates a recovery strategy outside the plume. We obtain the best performance by letting agents learn their recovery strategy and show that it is mostly casting cross wind, similar to behavior observed in flying insects. The optimal strategy is robust to substantial changes in the odor plumes, suggesting minor parameter tuning may be sufficient to adapt to different environments.</p></details> | 26 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Heterogeneity-aware Personalized Federated Learning via Adaptive Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16966v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) empowers multiple clients to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing local data, making it highly applicable in heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, intrinsic heterogeneity in clients' model architectures and computing capabilities often results in model accuracy loss and the intractable straggler problem, which significantly impairs training effectiveness. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Heterogeneity-aware Personalized Federated Learning method, named HAPFL, via multi-level Reinforcement Learning (RL) mechanisms. HAPFL optimizes the training process by incorporating three strategic components: 1) An RL-based heterogeneous model allocation mechanism. The parameter server employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RL agent to adaptively allocate appropriately sized, differentiated models to clients based on their performance, effectively mitigating performance disparities. 2) An RL-based training intensity adjustment scheme. The parameter server leverages another PPO-based RL agent to dynamically fine-tune the training intensity for each client to further enhance training efficiency and reduce straggling latency. 3) A knowledge distillation-based mutual learning mechanism. Each client deploys both a heterogeneous local model and a homogeneous lightweight model named LiteModel, where these models undergo mutual learning through knowledge distillation. This uniform LiteModel plays a pivotal role in aggregating and sharing global knowledge, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of personalized local training. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAPFL not only achieves high accuracy but also substantially reduces the overall training time by 20.9%-40.4% and decreases straggling latency by 19.0%-48.0% compared to existing solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Upside Down Reinforcement Learning with Policy Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16288v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Upside Down Reinforcement Learning (UDRL) is a promising framework for solving reinforcement learning problems which focuses on learning command-conditioned policies. In this work, we extend UDRL to the task of learning a command-conditioned generator of deep neural network policies. We accomplish this using Hypernetworks - a variant of Fast Weight Programmers, which learn to decode input commands representing a desired expected return into command-specific weight matrices. Our method, dubbed Upside Down Reinforcement Learning with Policy Generators (UDRLPG), streamlines comparable techniques by removing the need for an evaluator or critic to update the weights of the generator. To counteract the increased variance in last returns caused by not having an evaluator, we decouple the sampling probability of the buffer from the absolute number of policies in it, which, together with a simple weighting strategy, improves the empirical convergence of the algorithm. Compared with existing algorithms, UDRLPG achieves competitive performance and high returns, sometimes outperforming more complex architectures. Our experiments show that a trained generator can generalize to create policies that achieve unseen returns zero-shot. The proposed method appears to be effective in mitigating some of the challenges associated with learning highly multimodal functions. Altogether, we believe that UDRLPG represents a promising step forward in achieving greater empirical sample efficiency in RL.

However, accumulated model errors during these rollouts can distort the data distribution, negatively impacting policy learning and hindering long-term planning. Thus, the accumulation of model errors is a key bottleneck in current MBRL methods. We propose Infoprop, a model-based rollout mechanism that separates aleatoric from epistemic model uncertainty and reduces the influence of the latter on the data distribution. Further, Infoprop keeps track of accumulated model errors along a model rollout and provides termination criteria to limit data corruption. We demonstrate the capabilities of Infoprop in the Infoprop-Dyna algorithm, reporting state-of-the-art performance in Dyna-style MBRL on common MuJoCo benchmark tasks while substantially increasing rollout length and data quality.</p></details> |  |

Despite growing interest, developing robust TTA models remains challenging due to the scarcity of well-labeled datasets and the prevalence of noisy or inaccurate captions in large-scale, weakly labeled corpora. To address these challenges, we propose CosyAudio, a novel framework that utilizes confidence scores and synthetic captions to enhance the quality of audio generation. CosyAudio consists of two core components: AudioCapTeller and an audio generator. AudioCapTeller generates synthetic captions for audio and provides confidence scores to evaluate their accuracy. The audio generator uses these synthetic captions and confidence scores to enable quality-aware audio generation. Additionally, we introduce a self-evolving training strategy that iteratively optimizes CosyAudio across both well-labeled and weakly-labeled datasets. Initially trained with well-labeled data, AudioCapTeller leverages its assessment capabilities on weakly-labeled datasets for high-quality filtering and reinforcement learning, which further improves its performance. The well-trained AudioCapTeller refines corpora by generating new captions and confidence scores, serving for the audio generator training. Extensive experiments on open-source datasets demonstrate that CosyAudio outperforms existing models in automated audio captioning, generates more faithful audio, and exhibits strong generalization across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Data-adaptive Safety Rules for Training Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15453v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is commonly employed to tailor models to human preferences, especially to improve the safety of outputs from large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, this method depends on selecting preferred responses from pairs. However, due to the variability in human opinions and the challenges in directly comparing two responses, there is an increasing trend towards fine-grained annotation approaches that evaluate responses using multiple targeted metrics or rules. The challenge lies in efficiently choosing and applying these rules to handle the diverse range of preference data. In this paper, we propose a dynamic method that adaptively selects the most important rules for each response pair. We introduce a mathematical framework that utilizes the maximum discrepancy across paired responses and demonstrate theoretically that this approach maximizes the mutual information between the rule-based annotations and the underlying true preferences. We then train an 8B reward model using this adaptively labeled preference dataset and assess its efficacy using RewardBench. As of January 25, 2025, our model achieved the highest safety performance on the leaderboard, surpassing various larger models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16025v7)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have seen remarkable progress, but key challenges remain. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) is known for ensuring monotonic policy improvement through conservative updates within a trust region, backed by strong theoretical guarantees. However, its reliance on complex second-order optimization limits its practical efficiency. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) addresses this by simplifying TRPO's approach using ratio clipping, improving efficiency but sacrificing some theoretical robustness. This raises a natural question: Can we combine the strengths of both methods? In this paper, we introduce Simple Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel unconstrained first-order algorithm. By slightly modifying the policy loss used in PPO, SPO can achieve the best of both worlds. Our new objective improves upon ratio clipping, offering stronger theoretical properties and better constraining the probability ratio within the trust region. Empirical results demonstrate that SPO outperforms PPO with a simple implementation, particularly for training large, complex network architectures end-to-end.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dream to Drive with Predictive Individual World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16733v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is still a challenging topic to make reactive driving behaviors in complex urban environments as road users' intentions are unknown. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers great potential to learn a reactive policy by constructing a world model that can provide informative states and imagination training. However, a critical limitation in relevant research lies in the scene-level reconstruction representation learning, which may overlook key interactive vehicles and hardly model the interactive features among vehicles and their long-term intentions. Therefore, this paper presents a novel MBRL method with a predictive individual world model (PIWM) for autonomous driving. PIWM describes the driving environment from an individual-level perspective and captures vehicles' interactive relations and their intentions via trajectory prediction task. Meanwhile, a behavior policy is learned jointly with PIWM. It is trained in PIWM's imagination and effectively navigates in the urban driving scenes leveraging intention-aware latent states. The proposed method is trained and evaluated on simulation environments built upon real-world challenging interactive scenarios. Compared with popular model-free and state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning methods, experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance in terms of safety and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes: https://github.com/gaoyinfeng/PIWM</p></details> |

However, cleverly crafted prompts can bypass these safety measures without accessing the model's internal parameters, a phenomenon known as black-box jailbreak. Existing heuristic black-box attack methods, such as genetic algorithms, suffer from limited effectiveness due to their inherent randomness, while recent reinforcement learning (RL) based methods often lack robust and informative reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose a novel black-box jailbreak method leveraging RL, which optimizes prompt generation by analyzing the embedding proximity between benign and malicious prompts. This approach ensures that the rewritten prompts closely align with the intent of the original prompts while enhancing the attack's effectiveness. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive jailbreak evaluation framework incorporating keywords, intent matching, and answer validation to provide a more rigorous and holistic assessment of jailbreak success. Experimental results show the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several prominent open and closed-source LLMs, including Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and GPT-4o-0806. Our method sets a new benchmark in jailbreak attack effectiveness, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in LLMs. The codebase for this work is available at https://github.com/Aegis1863/xJailbreak.</p></details> |  |

As supply chains become increasingly complex, traditional methods of root cause analysis struggle to capture the intricate interrelationships between various factors, often leading to spurious correlations and suboptimal decision-making. Our approach addresses these challenges by leveraging causal discovery to identify the true causal relationships between operational variables, and reinforcement learning to iteratively refine the causal graph. This method enables the accurate identification of key drivers of late deliveries, such as shipping mode and delivery status, and provides actionable insights for optimizing supply chain performance. We apply our approach to a real-world supply chain dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in uncovering the underlying causes of delivery delays and offering strategies for mitigating these risks. The findings have significant implications for improving operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall profitability within supply chains.</p></details> |  |

Traditional training-time methods finetune LLMs using human preference datasets but incur significant training costs and require repeated training to handle diverse user preferences. Test-time alignment methods address this by using reward models (RMs) to guide frozen LLMs without retraining. However, existing test-time approaches rely on trajectory-level RMs which are designed to evaluate complete responses, making them unsuitable for autoregressive text generation that requires computing next-token rewards from partial responses. To address this, we introduce GenARM, a test-time alignment approach that leverages the Autoregressive Reward Model--a novel reward parametrization designed to predict next-token rewards for efficient and effective autoregressive generation. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this parametrization can provably guide frozen LLMs toward any distribution achievable by traditional RMs within the KL-regularized reinforcement learning framework. Experimental results show that GenARM significantly outperforms prior test-time alignment baselines and matches the performance of training-time methods. Additionally, GenARM enables efficient weak-to-strong guidance, aligning larger LLMs with smaller RMs without the high costs of training larger models. Furthermore, GenARM supports multi-objective alignment, allowing real-time trade-offs between preference dimensions and catering to diverse user preferences without retraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Improving Vision-Language-Action Model with Online Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16664v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have successfully integrated large vision-language models (VLMs) into low-level robotic control by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with expert robotic datasets, resulting in what we term vision-language-action (VLA) models. Although the VLA models are powerful, how to improve these large models during interaction with environments remains an open question. In this paper, we explore how to further improve these VLA models via Reinforcement Learning (RL), a commonly used fine-tuning technique for large models. However, we find that directly applying online RL to large VLA models presents significant challenges, including training instability that severely impacts the performance of large models, and computing burdens that exceed the capabilities of most local machines. To address these challenges, we propose iRe-VLA framework, which iterates between Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning to effectively improve VLA models, leveraging the exploratory benefits of RL while maintaining the stability of supervised learning. Experiments in two simulated benchmarks and a real-world manipulation suite validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

We introduce and solve the Exploratory Mean Variance with Regime Switching (EMVRS) problem. We also present a Policy Improvement Theorem. Further, we recognize that the widely applied Temporal Difference (TD) learning is not adequate for the EMVRS context, hence we consider Orthogonality Condition (OC) learning, leveraging the martingale property of the induced optimal value function from the analytical solution to EMVRS. We design a RL algorithm that has more meaningful parameterization using the market parameters and propose an updating scheme for each parameter. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of OC learning over TD learning with a clear convergence of the market parameters towards their corresponding ``grounding true" values in a simulated market scenario. In a real market data study, EMVRS with OC learning outperforms its counterparts with the highest mean and reasonably low volatility of the annualized portfolio returns.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance on October 11th, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Safe Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Engine Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16613v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a toolchain for applying Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, in safety-critical real-world environments. As an exemplary application, transient load control is demonstrated on a single-cylinder internal combustion engine testbench in Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) mode, that offers high thermal efficiency and low emissions. However, HCCI poses challenges for traditional control methods due to its nonlinear, autoregressive, and stochastic nature. RL provides a viable solution, however, safety concerns, such as excessive pressure rise rates, must be addressed when applying to HCCI. A single unsuitable control input can severely damage the engine or cause misfiring and shut down. Additionally, operating limits are not known a priori and must be determined experimentally. To mitigate these risks, real-time safety monitoring based on the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is implemented, enabling safe interaction with the testbench. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated as the RL agent learns a control policy through interaction with the testbench. A root mean square error of 0.1374 bar is achieved for the indicated mean effective pressure, comparable to neural network-based controllers from the literature. The toolchain's flexibility is further demonstrated by adapting the agent's policy to increase ethanol energy shares, promoting renewable fuel use while maintaining safety. This RL approach addresses the longstanding challenge of applying RL to safety-critical real-world environments. The developed toolchain, with its adaptability and safety mechanisms, paves the way for future applicability of RL in engine testbenches and other safety-critical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Applying Ensemble Models based on Graph Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning for Wind Power Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16591v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting the wind power output of a wind farm across various time scales utilizing Wind Power Forecasting (WPF) is a critical issue in wind power trading and utilization. The WPF problem remains unresolved due to numerous influencing variables, such as wind speed, temperature, latitude, and longitude. Furthermore, achieving high prediction accuracy is crucial for maintaining electric grid stability and ensuring supply security. In this paper, we model all wind turbines within a wind farm as graph nodes in a graph built by their geographical locations. Accordingly, we propose an ensemble model based on graph neural networks and reinforcement learning (EMGRL) for WPF. Our approach includes: (1) applying graph neural networks to capture the time-series data from neighboring wind farms relevant to the target wind farm; (2) establishing a general state embedding that integrates the target wind farm's data with the historical performance of base models on the target wind farm; (3) ensembling and leveraging the advantages of all base models through an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework for WPF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning Based Control for Legged Robot Locomotion in MuJoCo Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16590v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two prominent strategies for controlling legged robots, each with unique strengths. RL learns control policies through system interaction, adapting to various scenarios, whereas MPC relies on a predefined mathematical model to solve optimization problems in real-time. Despite their widespread use, there is a lack of direct comparative analysis under standardized conditions. This work addresses this gap by benchmarking MPC and RL controllers on a Unitree Go1 quadruped robot within the MuJoCo simulation environment, focusing on a standardized task-straight walking at a constant velocity. Performance is evaluated based on disturbance rejection, energy efficiency, and terrain adaptability. The results show that RL excels in handling disturbances and maintaining energy efficiency but struggles with generalization to new terrains due to its dependence on learned policies tailored to specific environments. In contrast, MPC shows enhanced recovery capabilities from larger perturbations by leveraging its optimization-based approach, allowing for a balanced distribution of control efforts across the robot's joints. The results provide a clear understanding of the advantages and limitations of both RL and MPC, offering insights into selecting an appropriate control strategy for legged robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we design a distributed framework for safe multi-agent control in large-scale environments with obstacles, where a large number of agents are required to maintain safety using only local information and reach their goal locations. We introduce a new class of certificates, termed graph control barrier function (GCBF), which are based on the well-established control barrier function theory for safety guarantees and utilize a graph structure for scalable and generalizable distributed control of MAS. We develop a novel theoretical framework to prove the safety of an arbitrary-sized MAS with a single GCBF. We propose a new training framework GCBF+ that uses graph neural networks to parameterize a candidate GCBF and a distributed control policy. The proposed framework is distributed and is capable of taking point clouds from LiDAR, instead of actual state information, for real-world robotic applications. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method through various hardware experiments on a swarm of drones with objectives ranging from exchanging positions to docking on a moving target without collision. Additionally, we perform extensive numerical experiments, where the number and density of agents, as well as the number of obstacles, increase. Empirical results show that in complex environments with agents with nonlinear dynamics (e.g., Crazyflie drones), GCBF+ outperforms the hand-crafted CBF-based method with the best performance by up to 20% for relatively small-scale MAS with up to 256 agents, and leading reinforcement learning (RL) methods by up to 40% for MAS with 1024 agents. Furthermore, the proposed method does not compromise on the performance, in terms of goal reaching, for achieving high safety rates, which is a common trade-off in RL-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 15 figures; Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Federated RLHF with Aggregated Client Preference for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03038v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using user preference data, enabling it to generate content aligned with human preferences. However, due to privacy concerns, users may be reluctant to share sensitive preference data. To address this, we propose utilizing Federated Learning (FL) techniques, allowing large-scale preference collection from diverse real-world users without requiring them to transmit data to a central server. Our federated RLHF methods (i.e., FedBis and FedBiscuit) encode each client's preferences into binary selectors and aggregate them to capture common preferences. In particular, FedBiscuit overcomes key challenges, such as preference heterogeneity and reward hacking, through innovative solutions like grouping clients with similar preferences to reduce heterogeneity and using multiple binary selectors to enhance LLM output quality. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we establish the first federated RLHF benchmark with a heterogeneous human preference dataset. Experimental results show that by integrating the LLM with aggregated client preferences, FedBis and FedBiscuit significantly enhance the professionalism and readability of the generated content.</p></details> | ICLR'25 |

Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers a solution by leveraging learnt world models to generate simulated experience, thereby improving sample efficiency. However, in visually complex environments, small or dynamic elements can be critical for decision-making. Yet, traditional MBRL methods in pixel-based environments typically rely on auto-encoding with an $L_2$ loss, which is dominated by large areas and often fails to capture decision-relevant details. To address these limitations, we propose an object-centric MBRL pipeline, which integrates recent advances in computer vision to allow agents to focus on key decision-related elements. Our approach consists of four main steps: (1) annotating key objects related to rewards and goals with segmentation masks, (2) extracting object features using a pre-trained, frozen foundation vision model, (3) incorporating these object features with the raw observations to predict environmental dynamics, and (4) training the policy using imagined trajectories generated by this object-centric world model. Building on the efficient MBRL algorithm STORM, we call this pipeline OC-STORM. We demonstrate OC-STORM's practical value in overcoming the limitations of conventional MBRL approaches on both Atari games and the visually complex game Hollow Knight.</p></details> |  |

Most recent works of GUI action grounding leverage large GUI datasets to fine-tune MLLMs. However, the fine-tuning data always covers limited GUI environments, and we find the performance of the resulting model deteriorates in novel environments. We argue that the GUI grounding models should be further aligned to the novel environments to reveal their full potential, when the inference is known to involve novel environments, i.e., environments not used during the previous fine-tuning. To realize this, we first propose GUI-Bee, an MLLM-based autonomous agent, to collect high-quality, environment-specific data through exploration and then continuously fine-tune GUI grounding models with the collected data. Our agent leverages a novel Q-value-Incentive In-Context Reinforcement Learning (Q-ICRL) method to optimize exploration efficiency and data quality. Additionally, we introduce NovelScreenSpot, a benchmark for testing how well the data can help align GUI action grounding models to novel environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of data collected by GUI-Bee in the experiments. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to validate the Q-ICRL method in enhancing the efficiency of GUI-Bee. Project page: https://gui-bee.github.io</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a Quantum Natural Policy Gradient (QNPG) algorithm, which replaces the random sampling used in classical Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) estimators with a deterministic gradient estimation approach, enabling seamless integration into quantum systems. While this modification introduces a bounded bias in the estimator, the bias decays exponentially with increasing truncation levels. This paper demonstrates that the proposed QNPG algorithm achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ for queries to the quantum oracle, significantly improving the classical lower bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for queries to the MDP.</p></details> |  |

In practice however, RL algorithms are often tailored to specific benchmarks, relying on carefully tuned hyperparameters and algorithmic choices. Recently, powerful model-based RL methods have shown impressive general results across benchmarks but come at the cost of increased complexity and slow run times, limiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we attempt to find a unifying model-free deep RL algorithm that can address a diverse class of domains and problem settings. To achieve this, we leverage model-based representations that approximately linearize the value function, taking advantage of the denser task objectives used by model-based RL while avoiding the costs associated with planning or simulated trajectories. We evaluate our algorithm, MR.Q, on a variety of common RL benchmarks with a single set of hyperparameters and show a competitive performance against domain-specific and general baselines, providing a concrete step towards building general-purpose model-free deep RL algorithms.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

A major bottleneck in Gaussian elimination for these systems is fill-in, the creation of non-zero entries that increase memory and computational cost. Minimizing fill-in is NP-hard, and existing heuristics like Minimum Degree and Nested Dissection offer limited adaptability across diverse problem instances. We introduce \textit{ReFill}, a reinforcement learning framework enhanced by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn adaptive ordering strategies for fill-in minimization. ReFill trains a GNN-based heuristic to predict efficient elimination orders, outperforming traditional heuristics by dynamically adapting to the structure of input matrices. Experiments demonstrate that ReFill outperforms strong heuristics in reducing fill-in, highlighting the untapped potential of learning-based methods for this well-studied classical problem.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional MARL schemes face many obstacles in real-world scenarios. First, most MARL algorithms are online, which might be unsafe and impractical. Second, MARL algorithms are environment-specific, meaning network configuration changes require model retraining. This letter proposes a novel meta-offline MARL algorithm that combines conservative Q-learning (CQL) and model agnostic meta-learning (MAML). CQL enables offline training by leveraging pre-collected datasets, while MAML ensures scalability and adaptability to dynamic network configurations and objectives. We propose two algorithm variants: independent training (M-I-MARL) and centralized training decentralized execution (M-CTDE-MARL). Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional schemes, especially the CTDE approach that achieves 50 % faster convergence in dynamic scenarios than the benchmarks. The proposed framework enhances scalability, robustness, and adaptability in wireless communication systems by optimizing UAV trajectories and scheduling policies.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM web agents heavily rely on expensive proprietary LLM APIs, while open LLMs lack the necessary decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces WebRL, a self-evolving online curriculum reinforcement learning framework designed to train high-performance web agents using open LLMs. WebRL addresses three key challenges in building LLM web agents, including the scarcity of training tasks, sparse feedback signals, and policy distribution drift in online learning. Specifically, WebRL incorporates 1) a self-evolving curriculum that generates new tasks from unsuccessful attempts, 2) a robust outcome-supervised reward model (ORM), and 3) adaptive reinforcement learning strategies to ensure consistent improvements. We apply WebRL to transform open Llama-3.1 and GLM-4 models into proficient web agents. On WebArena-Lite, WebRL improves the success rate of Llama-3.1-8B from 4.8% to 42.4%, and from 6.1% to 43% for GLM-4-9B. These open models significantly surpass the performance of GPT-4-Turbo (17.6%) and GPT-4o (13.9%) and outperform previous state-of-the-art web agents trained on open LLMs (AutoWebGLM, 18.2%). Our findings demonstrate WebRL's effectiveness in bridging the gap between open and proprietary LLM-based web agents, paving the way for more accessible and powerful autonomous web interaction systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This work introduces PAINT (Preference Adaptation for INsulin control in T1D), an original RL framework for learning flexible insulin dosing policies from patient records. PAINT employs a sketch-based approach for reward learning, where past data is annotated with a continuous reward signal to reflect patient's desired outcomes. Labelled data trains a reward model, informing the actions of a novel safety-constrained offline RL algorithm, designed to restrict actions to a safe strategy and enable preference tuning via a sliding scale. In-silico evaluation shows PAINT achieves common glucose goals through simple labelling of desired states, reducing glycaemic risk by 15% over a commercial benchmark. Action labelling can also be used to incorporate patient expertise, demonstrating an ability to pre-empt meals (+10% time-in-range post-meal) and address certain device errors (-1.6% variance post-error) with patient guidance. These results hold under realistic conditions, including limited samples, labelling errors, and intra-patient variability. This work illustrates PAINT's potential in real-world T1D management and more broadly any tasks requiring rapid and precise preference learning under safety constraints.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

We discuss a convex formulation of the IRL problem (CIRL) initially proposed by Ng and Russel, and reformulate the problem such that the domain-specific language CVXPY can be applied directly to specify and solve the convex problem. We also extend the CIRL problem to scenarios where the expert policy is not given analytically but by trajectory as state-action pairs, which can be strongly inconsistent with optimality, by augmenting some of the constraints. Theoretical analysis and practical implementation for hyperparameter auto-selection are introduced. This note helps the users to easily apply CIRL for their problems, without background knowledge on convex optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Experience-replay Innovative Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12199v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite its groundbreaking success, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) still suffers from instability and nonstationarity. Replicator dynamics, the most well-known model from evolutionary game theory (EGT), provide a theoretical framework for the convergence of the trajectories to Nash equilibria and, as a result, have been used to ensure formal guarantees for MARL algorithms in stable game settings. However, they exhibit the opposite behavior in other settings, which poses the problem of finding alternatives to ensure convergence. In contrast, innovative dynamics, such as the Brown-von Neumann-Nash (BNN) or Smith, result in periodic trajectories with the potential to approximate Nash equilibria. Yet, no MARL algorithms based on these dynamics have been proposed. In response to this challenge, we develop a novel experience replay-based MARL algorithm that incorporates revision protocols as tunable hyperparameters. We demonstrate, by appropriately adjusting the revision protocols, that the behavior of our algorithm mirrors the trajectories resulting from these dynamics. Importantly, our contribution provides a framework capable of extending the theoretical guarantees of MARL algorithms beyond replicator dynamics. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with empirical results.</p></details> |  |

This theory is particularly valuable in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based low-altitude economy (LAE) networking scenarios, where it could effectively address inherent challenges of dynamic network conditions, multiple optimization objectives, and stability requirements. Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has garnered significant attention for its unprecedented capability to generate diverse digital content. Extending beyond content generation, in this paper, we propose a framework integrating generative diffusion models with reinforcement learning to address Lyapunov optimization problems in UAV-based LAE networking. We begin by introducing the fundamentals of Lyapunov optimization theory and analyzing the limitations of both conventional methods and traditional AI-enabled approaches. We then examine various GenAI models and comprehensively analyze their potential contributions to Lyapunov optimization. Subsequently, we develop a Lyapunov-guided generative diffusion model-based reinforcement learning framework and validate its effectiveness through a UAV-based LAE networking case study. Finally, we outline several directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, magazine paper</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Automatic Differentiation with Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05027v3)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing Jacobians with automatic differentiation is ubiquitous in many scientific domains such as machine learning, computational fluid dynamics, robotics and finance. Even small savings in the number of computations or memory usage in Jacobian computations can already incur massive savings in energy consumption and runtime. While there exist many methods that allow for such savings, they generally trade computational efficiency for approximations of the exact Jacobian. In this paper, we present a novel method to optimize the number of necessary multiplications for Jacobian computation by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (RL) and a concept called cross-country elimination while still computing the exact Jacobian. Cross-country elimination is a framework for automatic differentiation that phrases Jacobian accumulation as ordered elimination of all vertices on the computational graph where every elimination incurs a certain computational cost. We formulate the search for the optimal elimination order that minimizes the number of necessary multiplications as a single player game which is played by an RL agent. We demonstrate that this method achieves up to 33% improvements over state-of-the-art methods on several relevant tasks taken from diverse domains. Furthermore, we show that these theoretical gains translate into actual runtime improvements by providing a cross-country elimination interpreter in JAX that can efficiently execute the obtained elimination orders.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a spotlight paper at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Antifragile Perimeter Control: Anticipating and Gaining from Disruptions with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12665v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimal operation of transportation networks is often susceptible to unexpected disruptions, such as traffic incidents and social events. Many established control strategies rely on mathematical models that struggle to cope with real-world uncertainties, leading to a significant decline in effectiveness when faced with substantial disruptions. While previous research works have dedicated efforts to improving the robustness or resilience of transportation systems against disruptions, this paper applies the cutting-edge concept of antifragility to better design a traffic control strategy for urban road networks. Antifragility sets itself apart from robustness and resilience as it represents a system's ability to not only withstand stressors, shocks, and volatility but also thrive and enhance performance in the presence of such adversarial events. Hence, modern transportation systems call for solutions that are antifragile. In this work, we propose a model-free deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) scheme to control a two-region urban traffic perimeter network. The system exploits the learning capability of RL under disruptions to achieve antifragility. By monitoring the change rate and curvature of the traffic state with the RL framework, the proposed algorithm anticipates imminent disruptions. An additional term is also integrated into the RL algorithm as redundancy to improve the performance under disruption scenarios. When compared to a state-of-the-art model predictive control approach and a state-of-the-art RL algorithm, our proposed method demonstrates two antifragility-related properties: (a) gradual performance improvement under disruptions of constant magnitude; and (b) increasingly superior performance under growing disruptions.</p></details> | 34 pages, 13 figures |
| **[The Sample Complexity of Online Reinforcement Learning: A Multi-model Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15910v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the sample complexity of online reinforcement learning for nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous state and action spaces. Our analysis accommodates a large class of dynamical systems ranging from a finite set of nonlinear candidate models to models with bounded and Lipschitz continuous dynamics, to systems that are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters. In the most general setting, our algorithm achieves a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(N \epsilon^2 + \mathrm{ln}(m(\epsilon))/\epsilon^2)$, where $N$ is the time horizon, $\epsilon$ is a user-specified discretization width, and $m(\epsilon)$ measures the complexity of the function class under consideration via its packing number. In the special case where the dynamics are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters (such as neural networks, transformers, etc.), we prove a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N p})$, where $p$ denotes the number of parameters, recovering earlier sample-complexity results that were derived for linear time-invariant dynamical systems. While this article focuses on characterizing sample complexity, the proposed algorithms are likely to be useful in practice, due to their simplicity, the ability to incorporate prior knowledge, and their benign transient behavior.</p></details> | 18 pages, 1 figure |

The emergence of quantum computing and its potential applications in quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) further complicate benchmarking efforts. To enable valid performance comparisons and to streamline current research in this area, we propose a novel benchmarking methodology, which is based on a statistical estimator for sample complexity and a definition of statistical outperformance. Furthermore, considering QRL, our methodology casts doubt on some previous claims regarding its superiority. We conducted experiments on a novel benchmarking environment with flexible levels of complexity. While we still identify possible advantages, our findings are more nuanced overall. We discuss the potential limitations of these results and explore their implications for empirical research on quantum advantage in QRL.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 19 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[FuzzyLight: A Robust Two-Stage Fuzzy Approach for Traffic Signal Control Works in Real Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15820v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial in mitigating urban congestion and reducing emissions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise.

| **[When LLM Meets DRL: Advancing Jailbreaking Efficiency via DRL-guided Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08705v4)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies developed jailbreaking attacks, which construct jailbreaking prompts to fool LLMs into responding to harmful questions. Early-stage jailbreaking attacks require access to model internals or significant human efforts. More advanced attacks utilize genetic algorithms for automatic and black-box attacks. However, the random nature of genetic algorithms significantly limits the effectiveness of these attacks. In this paper, we propose RLbreaker, a black-box jailbreaking attack driven by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We model jailbreaking as a search problem and design an RL agent to guide the search, which is more effective and has less randomness than stochastic search, such as genetic algorithms. Specifically, we design a customized DRL system for the jailbreaking problem, including a novel reward function and a customized proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLbreaker is much more effective than existing jailbreaking attacks against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. We also show that RLbreaker is robust against three SOTA defenses and its trained agents can transfer across different LLMs. We further validate the key design choices of RLbreaker via a comprehensive ablation study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive AI-based Decentralized Resource Management in the Cloud-Edge Continuum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15802v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing complexity of application requirements and the dynamic nature of the Cloud-Edge Continuum present significant challenges for efficient resource management. These challenges stem from the ever-changing infrastructure, which is characterized by additions, removals, and reconfigurations of nodes and links, as well as the variability of application workloads. Traditional centralized approaches struggle to adapt to these changes due to their static nature, while decentralized solutions face challenges such as limited global visibility and coordination overhead. This paper proposes a hybrid decentralized framework for dynamic application placement and resource management. The framework utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to embed resource and application states, enabling comprehensive representation and efficient decision-making. It employs a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach, where local agents optimize resource management in their neighborhoods and a global orchestrator ensures system-wide coordination. By combining decentralized application placement with centralized oversight, our framework addresses the scalability, adaptability, and accuracy challenges inherent in the Cloud-Edge Continuum. This work contributes to the development of decentralized application placement strategies, the integration of GNN embeddings, and collaborative MARL systems, providing a foundation for efficient, adaptive and scalable resource management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selective Experience Sharing in Reinforcement Learning Enhances Interference Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15735v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) approach for inter-cell interference mitigation, in which agents selectively share their experiences with other agents. Each base station is equipped with an agent, which receives signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio from its own associated users. This information is used to evaluate and selectively share experiences with neighboring agents. The idea is that even a few pertinent experiences from other agents can lead to effective learning. This approach enables fully decentralized training and execution, minimizes information sharing between agents and significantly reduces communication overhead, which is typically the burden of interference management. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-agent RL techniques where training is done in a decentralized manner. Furthermore, with a 75% reduction in experience sharing, the proposed algorithm achieves 98% of the spectral efficiency obtained by algorithms sharing all experiences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the IEEE Communications Letters</p></details> |
| **[Contextual Knowledge Sharing in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Decentralized Communication and Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15695v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Dec-MARL) has emerged as a pivotal approach for addressing complex tasks in dynamic environments. Existing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methodologies typically assume a shared objective among agents and rely on centralized control. However, many real-world scenarios feature agents with individual goals and limited observability of other agents, complicating coordination and hindering adaptability. Existing Dec-MARL strategies prioritize either communication or coordination, lacking an integrated approach that leverages both. This paper presents a novel Dec-MARL framework that integrates peer-to-peer communication and coordination, incorporating goal-awareness and time-awareness into the agents' knowledge-sharing processes. Our framework equips agents with the ability to (i) share contextually relevant knowledge to assist other agents, and (ii) reason based on information acquired from multiple agents, while considering their own goals and the temporal context of prior knowledge. We evaluate our approach through several complex multi-agent tasks in environments with dynamically appearing obstacles. Our work demonstrates that incorporating goal-aware and time-aware knowledge sharing significantly enhances overall performance.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel approach, Trajectory Encoding Augmentation (TEA), which extends the state space by integrating latent representations of environmental dynamics obtained from sequence encoders, such as AutoEncoders. Our findings show that incorporating these encodings with TEA improves the transferability of a single policy to novel environments with new dynamics, surpassing methods that rely solely on unmodified states. These results indicate that TEA captures critical, environment-specific characteristics, enabling RL agents to generalize effectively across dynamic conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ESANN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multivariate Dynamic Mediation Analysis under a Reinforcement Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16203v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mediation analysis is an important analytic tool commonly used in a broad range of scientific applications. In this article, we study the problem of mediation analysis when there are multivariate and conditionally dependent mediators, and when the variables are observed over multiple time points. The problem is challenging, because the effect of a mediator involves not only the path from the treatment to this mediator itself at the current time point, but also all possible paths pointed to this mediator from its upstream mediators, as well as the carryover effects from all previous time points. We propose a novel multivariate dynamic mediation analysis approach. Drawing inspiration from the Markov decision process model that is frequently employed in reinforcement learning, we introduce a Markov mediation process paired with a system of time-varying linear structural equation models to formulate the problem. We then formally define the individual mediation effect, built upon the idea of simultaneous interventions and intervention calculus. We next derive the closed-form expression and propose an iterative estimation procedure under the Markov mediation process model. We study both the asymptotic property and the empirical performance of the proposed estimator, and further illustrate our method with a mobile health application.</p></details> |  |

However, employing LLMs with billions of parameters (e.g., GPT-4) may incur substantial costs on top of handcrafting extensive prompts. To address this, we introduce a Grounded Language Agent for Intelligent Web Interactions, named GLAINTEL. GLAINTEL employs Flan-T5 as its backbone and is flexible in training in various settings: unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised domain adaptation. Specifically, we tackle both the challenge of learning without human demonstrations and the opportunity to leverage human demonstrations effectively when those are available. Additionally, we explore unsupervised domain adaptation for cases where demonstrations are limited to a specific domain. Experimental evaluations across diverse setups demonstrate the effectiveness of GLAINTEL in unsupervised settings, outperforming in-context learning-based approaches that employ larger models with up to 540 billion parameters. Surprisingly, behavioral cloning-based methods that straightforwardly use human demonstrations do not outperform unsupervised variants of GLAINTEL. Additionally, we show that combining human demonstrations with reinforcement learning-based training yields results comparable to methods utilizing GPT-4.

However, the lack of interpretability limits their practical use, particularly in critical decision-making scenarios. Post-hoc interpretability, which provides explanations for pre-trained models, is often at risk of robustness and fidelity. This has inspired a rising interest in self-interpretable neural networks, which inherently reveal the prediction rationale through the model structures. Although there exist surveys on post-hoc interpretability, a comprehensive and systematic survey of self-interpretable neural networks is still missing. To address this gap, we first collect and review existing works on self-interpretable neural networks and provide a structured summary of their methodologies from five key perspectives: attribution-based, function-based, concept-based, prototype-based, and rule-based self-interpretation. We also present concrete, visualized examples of model explanations and discuss their applicability across diverse scenarios, including image, text, graph data, and deep reinforcement learning. Additionally, we summarize existing evaluation metrics for self-interpretability and identify open challenges in this field, offering insights for future research. To support ongoing developments, we present a publicly accessible resource to track advancements in this domain: https://github.com/yangji721/Awesome-Self-Interpretable-Neural-Network.</p></details> |  |

This approach directs fixation points to areas with significant differences between the reconstructed and input images. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves highly accurate fixation points, significantly enhances the network's classification accuracy, and reduces the average number of required fixations to achieve a predefined accuracy level.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Traditional RL methods often rely on real data for exploration, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce a distribution-aware flow matching approach designed to generate synthetic unstructured data, specifically tailored for the few-shot RL application of Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) on embedded processors. Our method leverages the flow matching algorithm as a sample-efficient generative model and incorporates bootstrapping techniques to enhance latent space diversity and generalization. Additionally, we apply feature weighting using Random Forests to prioritize critical features, improving the precision of the generated synthetic data. Our approach addresses key challenges in traditional model-based RL, such as overfitting and data correlation, while aligning with the principles of the Law of Large Numbers to support empirical consistency and policy improvement as the number of samples increases. We validate our approach through extensive experimentation on a DVFS application for low-energy processing. Results demonstrate that our method achieves stable convergence in terms of maximum Q-value while enhancing frame rates by 30\% in the initial timestamps. These improvements make the proposed RL model more efficient in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

In the ImageNet-1K benchmark test, our method reduces FLOPs by 42.7\% and peak memory usage by 34.1\% compared to the standard Transformer, while maintaining comparable accuracy ($\pm$0.3\%). Furthermore, we conducted practical deployment on the Jetson AGX Xavier platform, verifying the effectiveness and practical value of this method in resource-constrained environments. To further validate the generality of the method, we also conducted experiments on several natural language processing tasks and achieved significant improvements in resource efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, DRL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, especially action-level backdoors, which pose significant threats through precise manipulation and flexible activation, risking outcomes like vehicle collisions or drone crashes. The key distinction of action-level backdoors lies in the utilization of the backdoor reward function to associate triggers with target actions. Nevertheless, existing studies typically rely on backdoor reward functions with fixed values or conditional flipping, which lack universality across diverse DRL tasks and backdoor designs, resulting in fluctuations or even failure in practice. This paper proposes the first universal action-level backdoor attack framework, called UNIDOOR, which enables adaptive exploration of backdoor reward functions through performance monitoring, eliminating the reliance on expert knowledge and grid search. We highlight that action tampering serves as a crucial component of action-level backdoor attacks in continuous action scenarios, as it addresses attack failures caused by low-frequency target actions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UNIDOOR significantly enhances the attack performance of action-level backdoors, showcasing its universality across diverse attack scenarios, including single/multiple agents, single/multiple backdoors, discrete/continuous action spaces, and sparse/dense reward signals. Furthermore, visualization results encompassing state distribution, neuron activation, and animations demonstrate the stealthiness of UNIDOOR.

RL typically uses tables or linear approximators to map state-action tuples that maximises the reward. Combining RL with deep neural networks (DRL) significantly increases its scalability and enables it to address more complex problems than before. However, DRL also inherits downsides from both RL and deep learning. Despite DRL improves generalisation across similar state-action pairs when compared to simpler RL policy representations like tabular methods, it still requires the agent to adequately explore the state-action space. Additionally, deep methods require more training data, with the volume of data escalating with the complexity and size of the neural network. As a result, deep RL requires a long time to collect enough agent-environment samples and to successfully learn the underlying policy. Furthermore, often even a slight alteration to the task invalidates any previous acquired knowledge. To address these shortcomings, Transfer Learning (TL) has been introduced, which enables the use of external knowledge from other tasks or agents to enhance a learning process. The goal of TL is to reduce the learning complexity for an agent dealing with an unfamiliar task by simplifying the exploration process. This is achieved by lowering the amount of new information required by its learning model, resulting in a reduced overall convergence time...</p></details> | PhD Thesis |

However, existing methods ignore the complexity and dynamism of real-world traffic systems, resulting in significant gaps in efficiency and accuracy in real-time scenarios. Addressing this issue is a critical yet challenging task. This paper proposes a novel framework that redefines the implementation path of ER-TTE to achieve highly efficient and effective predictions. Firstly, we introduce a novel pipeline consisting of a Decision Maker and a Predictor to rectify the inefficient prediction strategies of current methods. The Decision Maker performs efficient real-time decisions to determine whether the high-complexity prediction model in the Predictor needs to be invoked, and the Predictor recalculates the travel time or infers from historical prediction results based on these decisions. Next, to tackle the dynamic and uncertain real-time scenarios, we model the online decision-making problem as a Markov decision process and design an intelligent agent based on reinforcement learning for autonomous decision-making. Moreover, to fully exploit the spatio-temporal correlation between online data and offline data, we meticulously design feature representation and encoding techniques based on the attention mechanism. Finally, to improve the flawed training and evaluation strategies of existing methods, we propose an end-to-end training and evaluation approach, incorporating curriculum learning strategies to manage spatio-temporal data for more advanced training algorithms. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets confirm that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGMOD 2025</p></details> |

However, extensive coverage of LEO satellites, combined with openness of channels, can cause the communication process to suffer from security risks. This paper presents a low-altitude friendly-jamming LEO satellite-maritime communication system enabled by a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to ensure data security at the physical layer. Since such a system requires trade-off policies that balance the secrecy rate and energy consumption of the UAV to meet evolving scenario demands, we formulate a secure satellite-maritime communication multi-objective optimization problem (SSMCMOP). In order to solve the dynamic and long-term optimization problem, we reformulate it into a Markov decision process. We then propose a transformer-enhanced soft actor critic (TransSAC) algorithm, which is a generative artificial intelligence-enable deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the reformulated problem, so that capturing global dependencies and diversely exploring weights. Simulation results demonstrate that the TransSAC outperforms various baselines, and achieves an optimal secrecy rate while effectively minimizing the energy consumption of the UAV. Moreover, the results find more suitable constraint values for the system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative Cruising: Reinforcement Learning-Based Time-Headway Control for Increased Traffic Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02520v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of connected automated vehicles represents an unprecedented opportunity for improving driving efficiency and alleviating traffic congestion. However, existing research fails to address realistic multi-lane highway scenarios without assuming connectivity, perception, and control capabilities that are typically unavailable in current vehicles. This paper proposes a novel AI system that is the first to improve highway traffic efficiency compared with human-like traffic in realistic, simulated multi-lane scenarios, while relying on existing connectivity, perception, and control capabilities. At the core of our approach is a reinforcement learning based controller that dynamically communicates time-headways to automated vehicles near bottlenecks based on real-time traffic conditions. These desired time-headways are then used by adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems to adjust their following distance. By (i) integrating existing traffic estimation technology and low-bandwidth vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, (ii) leveraging safety-certified ACC systems, and (iii) targeting localized bottleneck challenges that can be addressed independently in different locations, we propose a potentially practical, safe, and scalable system that can positively impact numerous road users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Episodic Novelty Through Temporal Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15418v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration in sparse reward environments remains a significant challenge in reinforcement learning, particularly in Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs), where environments differ across episodes. Existing episodic intrinsic motivation methods for CMDPs primarily rely on count-based approaches, which are ineffective in large state spaces, or on similarity-based methods that lack appropriate metrics for state comparison. To address these shortcomings, we propose Episodic Novelty Through Temporal Distance (ETD), a novel approach that introduces temporal distance as a robust metric for state similarity and intrinsic reward computation. By employing contrastive learning, ETD accurately estimates temporal distances and derives intrinsic rewards based on the novelty of states within the current episode. Extensive experiments on various benchmark tasks demonstrate that ETD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing exploration in sparse reward CMDPs.</p></details> | ICLR2025 |

How to balance the safety and performance in learning-based control problems is an interesting yet challenging issue. This paper aims to enhance system performance with safety guarantee in solving the reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimal control problems of nonlinear systems subject to high-relative-degree state constraints and unknown time-varying disturbance/actuator faults. First, to combine control barrier functions (CBFs) with RL, a new type of CBFs, termed high-order reciprocal control barrier function (HO-RCBF) is proposed to deal with high-relative-degree constraints during the learning process. Then, the concept of gradient similarity is proposed to quantify the relationship between the gradient of safety and the gradient of performance. Finally, gradient manipulation and adaptive mechanisms are introduced in the safe RL framework to enhance the performance with a safety guarantee. Two simulation examples illustrate that the proposed safe RL framework can address high-relative-degree constraint, enhance safety robustness and improve system performance.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Enhancing Disaster Resilience with UAV-Assisted Edge Computing: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Managing Heterogeneous Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15305v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge sensing and computing is rapidly becoming part of intelligent infrastructure architecture leading to operational reliance on such systems in disaster or emergency situations. In such scenarios there is a high chance of power supply failure due to power grid issues, and communication system issues due to base stations losing power or being damaged by the elements, e.g., flooding, wildfires etc. Mobile edge computing in the form of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been proposed to provide computation offloading from these devices to conserve their battery, while the use of UAVs as relay network nodes has also been investigated previously. This paper considers the use of UAVs with further constraints on power and connectivity to prolong the life of the network while also ensuring that the data is received from the edge nodes in a timely manner. Reinforcement learning is used to investigate numerous scenarios of various levels of power and communication failure. This approach is able to identify the device most likely to fail in a given scenario, thus providing priority guidance for maintenance personnel. The evacuations of a rural town and urban downtown area are also simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach at extending the life of the most critical edge devices.</p></details> |  |

HITL RL, previously employed in diverse applications such as modelling humanoid robot mechanics and enhancing language models, harnesses human feedback to refine the training process. In this study, we develop a HILT RL framework that can leverage the constraints and principles in music theory. In particular, we propose an episodic tabular Q-learning algorithm with an epsilon-greedy exploration policy. The system generates musical tracks (compositions), continuously enhancing its quality through iterative human-in-the-loop feedback. The reward function for this process is the subjective musical taste of the user.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint of a paper presented at the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData).

While such dialogue systems have been developing rapidly with the help of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) has attracted attention to align LLM-based dialogue models for such dialogue impressions. In RLAIF, a reward model based on another LLM is used to create a training signal for an LLM-based dialogue model using zero-shot/few-shot prompting techniques. However, evaluating an entire dialogue only by prompting LLMs is challenging. In this study, the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs prepared reward models corresponding to 12 metrics related to the impression of the entire dialogue for evaluating dialogue responses. We tuned our dialogue models using the reward model signals as feedback to improve the impression of the system. The results of automatic and human evaluations showed that tuning the dialogue model using our reward model corresponding to dialogue impression improved the evaluation of individual metrics and the naturalness of the dialogue response.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Into the Void: Mapping the Unseen Gaps in High Dimensional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15273v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive pipeline, augmented by a visual analytics system named ``GapMiner'', that is aimed at exploring and exploiting untapped opportunities within the empty areas of high-dimensional datasets. Our approach begins with an initial dataset and then uses a novel Empty Space Search Algorithm (ESA) to identify the center points of these uncharted voids, which are regarded as reservoirs containing potentially valuable novel configurations. Initially, this process is guided by user interactions facilitated by GapMiner. GapMiner visualizes the Empty Space Configurations (ESC) identified by the search within the context of the data, enabling domain experts to explore and adjust ESCs using a linked parallel-coordinate display. These interactions enhance the dataset and contribute to the iterative training of a connected deep neural network (DNN). As the DNN trains, it gradually assumes the task of identifying high-potential ESCs, diminishing the need for direct user involvement. Ultimately, once the DNN achieves adequate accuracy, it autonomously guides the exploration of optimal configurations by predicting performance and refining configurations, using a combination of gradient ascent and improved empty-space searches. Domain users were actively engaged throughout the development of our system. Our findings demonstrate that our methodology consistently produces substantially superior novel configurations compared to conventional randomization-based methods. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method through several case studies addressing various objectives, including parameter optimization, adversarial learning, and reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inductive Biases for Zero-shot Systematic Generalization in Language-informed Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15270v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency and systematic generalization are two long-standing challenges in reinforcement learning. Previous studies have shown that involving natural language along with other observation modalities can improve generalization and sample efficiency due to its compositional and open-ended nature. However, to transfer these properties of language to the decision-making process, it is necessary to establish a proper language grounding mechanism. One approach to this problem is applying inductive biases to extract fine-grained and informative representations from the observations, which makes them more connectable to the language units. We provide architecture-level inductive biases for modularity and sparsity mainly based on Neural Production Systems (NPS). Alongside NPS, we assign a central role to memory in our architecture. It can be seen as a high-level information aggregator which feeds policy/value heads with comprehensive information and simultaneously guides selective attention in NPS through attentional feedback. Our results in the BabyAI environment suggest that the proposed model's systematic generalization and sample efficiency are improved significantly compared to previous models. An extensive ablation study on variants of the proposed method is conducted, and the effectiveness of each employed technique on generalization, sample efficiency, and training stability is specified.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at Machine Learning (Springer Nature)</p></details> |
| **[Improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15228v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is extensively utilized to incorporate external, current knowledge into large language models, thereby minimizing hallucinations. A standard RAG pipeline may comprise several components, such as query rewriting, document retrieval, document filtering, and answer generation. However, these components are typically optimized separately through supervised fine-tuning, which can lead to misalignments between the objectives of individual modules and the overarching aim of generating accurate answers in question-answering (QA) tasks. Although recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize specific RAG components, these approaches often focus on overly simplistic pipelines with only two components or do not adequately address the complex interdependencies and collaborative interactions among the modules. To overcome these challenges, we propose treating the RAG pipeline as a multi-agent cooperative task, with each component regarded as an RL agent. Specifically, we present MMOA-RAG, a Multi-Module joint Optimization Algorithm for RAG, which employs multi-agent reinforcement learning to harmonize all agents' goals towards a unified reward, such as the F1 score of the final answer. Experiments conducted on various QA datasets demonstrate that MMOA-RAG improves the overall pipeline performance and outperforms existing baselines. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of individual components and the adaptability of MMOA-RAG across different RAG components and datasets. The code of MMOA-RAG is on https://github.com/chenyiqun/MMOA-RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Faster Machine Translation Ensembling with Reinforcement Learning and Competitive Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15219v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensembling neural machine translation (NMT) models to produce higher-quality translations than the $L$ individual models has been extensively studied. Recent methods typically employ a candidate selection block (CSB) and an encoder-decoder fusion block (FB), requiring inference across \textit{all} candidate models, leading to significant computational overhead, generally $\Omega(L)$. This paper introduces \textbf{SmartGen}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategy that improves the CSB by selecting a small, fixed number of candidates and identifying optimal groups to pass to the fusion block for each input sentence. Furthermore, previously, the CSB and FB were trained independently, leading to suboptimal NMT performance. Our DQN-based \textbf{SmartGen} addresses this by using feedback from the FB block as a reward during training. We also resolve a key issue in earlier methods, where candidates were passed to the FB without modification, by introducing a Competitive Correction Block (CCB). Finally, we validate our approach with extensive experiments on English-Hindi translation tasks in both directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive Lagrangian Optimization for Constrained Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15217v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained optimization is popularly seen in reinforcement learning for addressing complex control tasks. From the perspective of dynamic system, iteratively solving a constrained optimization problem can be framed as the temporal evolution of a feedback control system. Classical constrained optimization methods, such as penalty and Lagrangian approaches, inherently use proportional and integral feedback controllers. In this paper, we propose a more generic equivalence framework to build the connection between constrained optimization and feedback control system, for the purpose of developing more effective constrained RL algorithms. Firstly, we define that each step of the system evolution determines the Lagrange multiplier by solving a multiplier feedback optimal control problem (MFOCP). In this problem, the control input is multiplier, the state is policy parameters, the dynamics is described by policy gradient descent, and the objective is to minimize constraint violations. Then, we introduce a multiplier guided policy learning (MGPL) module to perform policy parameters updating. And we prove that the resulting optimal policy, achieved through alternating MFOCP and MGPL, aligns with the solution of the primal constrained RL problem, thereby establishing our equivalence framework. Furthermore, we point out that the existing PID Lagrangian is merely one special case within our framework that utilizes a PID controller. We also accommodate the integration of other various feedback controllers, thereby facilitating the development of new algorithms. As a representative, we employ model predictive control (MPC) as the feedback controller and consequently propose a new algorithm called predictive Lagrangian optimization (PLO). Numerical experiments demonstrate its superiority over the PID Lagrangian method, achieving a larger feasible region up to 7.2% and a comparable average reward.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods, primarily based on preference datasets, face challenges such as noisy labels, high annotation costs, and privacy concerns. In this work, we introduce Alignment from Demonstrations (AfD), a novel approach leveraging high-quality demonstration data to overcome these challenges. We formalize AfD within a sequential decision-making framework, highlighting its unique challenge of missing reward signals. Drawing insights from forward and inverse reinforcement learning, we introduce divergence minimization objectives for AfD. Analytically, we elucidate the mass-covering and mode-seeking behaviors of various approaches, explaining when and why certain methods are superior. Practically, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm that extrapolates over a tailored reward model for AfD. We validate our key insights through experiments on the Harmless and Helpful tasks, demonstrating their strong empirical performance while maintaining simplicity.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLIM: Sim-to-Real Legged Instructive Manipulation via Long-Horizon Visuomotor Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09905v3)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a low-cost legged mobile manipulation system that solves long-horizon real-world tasks, trained by reinforcement learning purely in simulation. This system is made possible by 1) a hierarchical design of a high-level policy for visual-mobile manipulation following instructions and a low-level policy for quadruped movement and limb control, 2) a progressive exploration and learning approach that leverages privileged task decomposition information to train the teacher policy for long-horizon tasks, which will guide an imitation-based student policy for efficient training of the high-level visuomotor policy, and 3) a suite of techniques for minimizing sim-to-real gaps. In contrast to previous approaches that use high-end equipment, our system demonstrates effective performance with more accessible hardware - specifically, a Unitree Go1 quadruped, a WidowX250S arm, and a single wrist-mounted RGB camera - despite the increased challenges of sim-to-real transfer. When fully trained in simulation, a single policy autonomously solves long-horizon tasks such as search, move, grasp, and drop-into, achieving nearly 80% success. This performance is comparable to that of expert human teleoperation on the same tasks but significantly more efficient, operating at about 1.5x the speed. The sim-to-real transfer is fluid across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes under varying lighting conditions. Finally, we discuss the key techniques that enable the entire pipeline, including efficient RL training and sim-to-real, to work effectively for legged mobile manipulation, and present their ablation results.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods struggle to address the nuanced needs of non-expert users. We propose Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA), a novel framework that iteratively refines prompts and aligns generated images with user preferences. VCA employs a fine-tuned language model with reinforcement learning and multi-turn dialogues for prompt disambiguation. Key components include the Incremental Context-Enhanced Dialogue Block for interactive clarification, the Semantic Exploration and Disambiguation Module (SESD) leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and CLIP scoring, and the Pixel Precision and Consistency Optimization Module (PPCO) for refining image details using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). A human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism further improves performance. Experiments show that VCA surpasses models like DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion, reducing dialogue rounds to 4.3, achieving a CLIP score of 0.92, and enhancing user satisfaction to 4.73/5. Additionally, we introduce a novel multi-round dialogue dataset with prompt-image pairs and user intent annotations.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoRL: A GPU-accelerated Framework for Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15129v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (EvoRL) has emerged as a promising approach to overcoming the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning (RL) by integrating the Evolutionary Computation (EC) paradigm with RL. However, the population-based nature of EC significantly increases computational costs, thereby restricting the exploration of algorithmic design choices and scalability in large-scale settings. To address this challenge, we introduce $\texttt{$\textbf{EvoRL}$}$, the first end-to-end EvoRL framework optimized for GPU acceleration. The framework executes the entire training pipeline on accelerators, including environment simulations and EC processes, leveraging hierarchical parallelism through vectorization and compilation techniques to achieve superior speed and scalability. This design enables the efficient training of large populations on a single machine. In addition to its performance-oriented design, $\texttt{$\textbf{EvoRL}$}$ offers a comprehensive platform for EvoRL research, encompassing implementations of traditional RL algorithms (e.g., A2C, PPO, DDPG, TD3, SAC), Evolutionary Algorithms (e.g., CMA-ES, OpenES, ARS), and hybrid EvoRL paradigms such as Evolutionary-guided RL (e.g., ERL, CEM-RL) and Population-Based AutoRL (e.g., PBT). The framework's modular architecture and user-friendly interface allow researchers to seamlessly integrate new components, customize algorithms, and conduct fair benchmarking and ablation studies.

| **[Online Preference Alignment for Language Models via Count-based Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12735v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown great potential in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to align with human preferences. Existing methods perform preference alignment from a fixed dataset, which can be limited in data coverage, and the resulting reward model is hard to generalize in out-of-distribution responses. Thus, online RLHF is more desirable to empower the LLM to explore outside the support of the initial dataset by iteratively collecting the prompt-response pairs. In this paper, we study the fundamental problem in online RLHF, i.e. \emph{how to explore} for LLM. We give a theoretical motivation in linear reward assumption to show that an optimistic reward with an upper confidence bound (UCB) term leads to a provably efficient RLHF policy. Then, we reformulate our objective to direct preference optimization with an exploration term, where the UCB-term can be converted to a count-based exploration bonus. We further propose a practical algorithm, named \emph{Count-based Online Preference Optimization (COPO)}, which leverages a simple coin-flip counting module to estimate the pseudo-count of a prompt-response pair in previously collected data. COPO encourages LLMs to balance exploration and preference optimization in an iterative manner, which enlarges the exploration space and the entire data coverage of iterative LLM policies. We conduct online RLHF experiments on Zephyr and Llama-3 models. The results on instruction-following and standard academic benchmarks show that COPO significantly increases performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

To solve this problem, we use the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm within a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. Our numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving EE and satisfying QoS requirements. Additionally, we observe that system EE drops at higher frequencies, especially under double-Rayleigh fading.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Data Center Cooling System Optimization Using Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15085v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence have fueled a rapid expansion of the data center (DC) industry worldwide, accompanied by an immense appetite for electricity to power the DCs. In a typical DC, around 30~40% of the energy is spent on the cooling system rather than on computer servers, posing a pressing need for developing new energy-saving optimization technologies for DC cooling systems. However, optimizing such real-world industrial systems faces numerous challenges, including but not limited to a lack of reliable simulation environments, limited historical data, and stringent safety and control robustness requirements. In this work, we present a novel physics-informed offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework for energy efficiency optimization of DC cooling systems. The proposed framework models the complex dynamical patterns and physical dependencies inside a server room using a purposely designed graph neural network architecture that is compliant with the fundamental time-reversal symmetry. Because of its well-behaved and generalizable state-action representations, the model enables sample-efficient and robust latent space offline policy learning using limited real-world operational data. Our framework has been successfully deployed and verified in a large-scale production DC for closed-loop control of its air-cooling units (ACUs). We conducted a total of 2000 hours of short and long-term experiments in the production DC environment. The results show that our method achieves 14~21% energy savings in the DC cooling system, without any violation of the safety or operational constraints. Our results have demonstrated the significant potential of offline RL in solving a broad range of data-limited, safety-critical real-world industrial control problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Divergence-Augmented Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15034v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In deep reinforcement learning, policy optimization methods need to deal with issues such as function approximation and the reuse of off-policy data. Standard policy gradient methods do not handle off-policy data well, leading to premature convergence and instability. This paper introduces a method to stabilize policy optimization when off-policy data are reused. The idea is to include a Bregman divergence between the behavior policy that generates the data and the current policy to ensure small and safe policy updates with off-policy data. The Bregman divergence is calculated between the state distributions of two policies, instead of only on the action probabilities, leading to a divergence augmentation formulation. Empirical experiments on Atari games show that in the data-scarce scenario where the reuse of off-policy data becomes necessary, our method can achieve better performance than other state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>33rd ...</summary><p>33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada</p></details> |

Unlike rule-based or supervised learning-based methods, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based controllers eliminate the need for domain-specific knowledge and datasets, thus providing adaptability to various scenarios. Nonetheless, a common limitation of existing studies on DRL-based controllers is their focus on driving scenarios with simple traffic patterns, which hinders their capability to effectively handle complex driving environments with delayed, long-term rewards, thus compromising the generalizability of their findings. In response to these limitations, our research introduces a pioneering hierarchical framework that efficiently decomposes intricate decision-making problems into manageable and interpretable subtasks. We adopt a two step training process that trains the high-level controller and low-level controller separately. The high-level controller exhibits an enhanced exploration potential with long-term delayed rewards, and the low-level controller provides longitudinal and lateral control ability using short-term instantaneous rewards. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of our hierarchical controller in managing complex highway driving situations.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose temporal logic Specification-conditioned Decision Transformer (SDT), a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of signal temporal logic (STL) to specify complex temporal rules that an agent should follow and the sequential modeling capability of Decision Transformer (DT). Empirical evaluations on the DSRL benchmarks demonstrate the better capacity of SDT in learning safe and high-reward policies compared with existing approaches. In addition, SDT shows good alignment with respect to different desired degrees of satisfaction of the STL specification that it is conditioned on.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICML 2024</p></details> |

| **[LiPO: Listwise Preference Optimization through Learning-to-Rank](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01878v3)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning language models (LMs) with curated human feedback is critical to control their behaviors in real-world applications. Several recent policy optimization methods, such as DPO and SLiC, serve as promising alternatives to the traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) approach. In practice, human feedback often comes in a format of a ranked list over multiple responses to amortize the cost of reading prompt. Multiple responses can also be ranked by reward models or AI feedback. There lacks such a thorough study on directly fitting upon a list of responses. In this work, we formulate the LM alignment as a \textit{listwise} ranking problem and describe the LiPO framework, where the policy can potentially learn more effectively from a ranked list of plausible responses given the prompt. This view draws an explicit connection to Learning-to-Rank (LTR), where most existing preference optimization work can be mapped to existing ranking objectives. Following this connection, we provide an examination of ranking objectives that are not well studied for LM alignment with DPO and SLiC as special cases when list size is two. In particular, we highlight a specific method, LiPO-$\lambda$, which leverages a state-of-the-art \textit{listwise} ranking objective and weights each preference pair in a more advanced manner. We show that LiPO-$\lambda$ can outperform DPO variants and SLiC by a clear margin on several preference alignment tasks with both curated and real rankwise preference data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[An Attentive Graph Agent for Topology-Adaptive Cyber Defence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14700v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, reinforcement learning is emerging as a promising technique to create intelligent, self-improving defensive systems. However, most existing autonomous defensive agents have overlooked the inherent graph structure of computer networks subject to cyber attacks, potentially missing critical information. To address this gap, we developed a custom version of the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment that encodes the observable network state as a directed graph, utilizing realistic and interpretable low-level features. %, like number of open ports and unexpected detected connections. We leverage a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture to process node, edge, and global features, and modify its output to be compatible with policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning. GAT policies offer several advantages over standard approaches based on simplistic flattened state observations. They can handle the changes in network topology that occur at runtime when dynamic connections between hosts appear. Policies can be deployed to networks that differ in size to the ones seen during training, enabling a degree of generalisation inaccessible with alternative approaches. Furthermore, the graph neural network policies outputs are explainable in terms of tangible network properties, providing enhanced interpretability of defensive actions. We verify that our low-level graph observations are meaningful enough to train GAT defensive policies that are able to adapt to changing topologies. We evaluate how our trained policies perform when deployed on networks of varying sizes with the same subnetwork structure, comparing them against policies specifically trained for each network configuration. Our study contributes to the development of robust cyber defence systems that can better adapt to real-world network security challenges.</p></details> |  |

To address this lack, we propose PokeFlex, a dataset featuring real-world multimodal data that is paired and annotated. The modalities include 3D textured meshes, point clouds, RGB images, and depth maps. Such data can be leveraged for several downstream tasks, such as online 3D mesh reconstruction, and it can potentially enable underexplored applications such as the real-world deployment of traditional control methods based on mesh simulations. To deal with the challenges posed by real-world 3D mesh reconstruction, we leverage a professional volumetric capture system that allows complete 360{\deg} reconstruction. PokeFlex consists of 18 deformable objects with varying stiffness and shapes. Deformations are generated by dropping objects onto a flat surface or by poking the objects with a robot arm. Interaction wrenches and contact locations are also reported for the latter case. Using different data modalities, we demonstrated a use case for our dataset training models that, given the novelty of the multimodal nature of Pokeflex, constitute the state-of-the-art in multi-object online template-based mesh reconstruction from multimodal data, to the best of our knowledge. We refer the reader to our website ( https://pokeflex-dataset.github.io/ ) for further demos and examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Robust Policy Search for Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01000v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex robot navigation and control problems can be framed as policy search problems. However, interactive learning in uncertain environments can be expensive, requiring the use of data-efficient methods. Bayesian optimization is an efficient nonlinear optimization method where queries are carefully selected to gather information about the optimum location. This is achieved by a surrogate model, which encodes past information, and the acquisition function for query selection. Bayesian optimization can be very sensitive to uncertainty in the input data or prior assumptions. In this work, we incorporate both robust optimization and statistical robustness, showing that both types of robustness are synergistic. For robust optimization we use an improved version of unscented Bayesian optimization which provides safe and repeatable policies in the presence of policy uncertainty. We also provide new theoretical insights. For statistical robustness, we use an adaptive surrogate model and we introduce the Boltzmann selection as a stochastic acquisition method to have convergence guarantees and improved performance even with surrogate modeling errors. We present results in several optimization benchmarks and robot tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image-based Geo-localization for Robotics: Are Black-box Vision-Language Models there yet?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16947v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advances in Vision-Language models (VLMs) offer exciting opportunities for robotic applications involving image geo-localization, the problem of identifying the geo-coordinates of a place based on visual data only. Recent research works have focused on using a VLM as embeddings extractor for geo-localization, however, the most sophisticated VLMs may only be available as black boxes that are accessible through an API, and come with a number of limitations: there is no access to training data, model features and gradients; retraining is not possible; the number of predictions may be limited by the API; training on model outputs is often prohibited; and queries are open-ended. The utilization of a VLM as a stand-alone, zero-shot geo-localization system using a single text-based prompt is largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this paper undertakes the first systematic study, to the best of our knowledge, to investigate the potential of some of the state-of-the-art VLMs as stand-alone, zero-shot geo-localization systems in a black-box setting with realistic constraints. We consider three main scenarios for this thorough investigation: a) fixed text-based prompt; b) semantically-equivalent text-based prompts; and c) semantically-equivalent query images. We also take into account the auto-regressive and probabilistic generation process of the VLMs when investigating their utility for geo-localization task by using model consistency as a metric in addition to traditional accuracy. Our work provides new insights in the capabilities of different VLMs for the above-mentioned scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

We showcase the capabilities of our framework within the context of the real-world household competition. This research introduces a framework that utilizes RDMM (Robotics Decision-Making Models), which possess the capacity for decision-making within domain-specific contexts, as well as an awareness of their personal knowledge and capabilities. The framework leverages information to enhance the autonomous decision-making of the system. In contrast to other approaches, our focus is on real-time, on-device solutions, successfully operating on hardware with as little as 8GB of memory. Our framework incorporates visual perception models equipping robots with understanding of their environment. Additionally, the framework has integrated real-time speech recognition capabilities, thus enhancing the human-robot interaction experience. Experimental results demonstrate that the RDMM framework can plan with an 93\% accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset consisting of 27k planning instances, as well as 1.3k text-image annotated samples derived from the competition. The framework, benchmarks, datasets, and models developed in this work are publicly available on our GitHub repository at https://github.com/shadynasrat/RDMM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly-Supervised Learning via Multi-Lateral Decoder Branching for Tool Segmentation in Robot-Assisted Cardiovascular Catheterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07594v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot-assisted catheterization has garnered a good attention for its potentials in treating cardiovascular diseases. However, advancing surgeon-robot collaboration still requires further research, particularly on task-specific automation. For instance, automated tool segmentation can assist surgeons in visualizing and tracking of endovascular tools during cardiac procedures. While learning-based models have demonstrated state-of-the-art segmentation performances, generating ground-truth labels for fully-supervised methods is both labor-intensive time consuming, and costly. In this study, we propose a weakly-supervised learning method with multi-lateral pseudo labeling for tool segmentation in cardiovascular angiogram datasets. The method utilizes a modified U-Net architecture featuring one encoder and multiple laterally branched decoders. The decoders generate diverse pseudo labels under different perturbations, augmenting available partial labels. The pseudo labels are self-generated using a mixed loss function with shared consistency across the decoders. The weakly-supervised model was trained end-to-end and validated using partially annotated angiogram data from three cardiovascular catheterization procedures. Validation results show that the model could perform closer to fully-supervised models. Also, the proposed weakly-supervised multi-lateral method outperforms three well known methods used for weakly-supervised learning, offering the highest segmentation performance across the three angiogram datasets. Furthermore, numerous ablation studies confirmed the model's consistent performance under different parameters. Finally, the model was applied for tool segmentation in a robot-assisted catheterization experiments. The model enhanced visualization with high connectivity indices for guidewire and catheter, and a mean processing time of 35 ms per frame.</p></details> |  |

While brushing is commonly used both to detangle hair and for styling purposes, existing research primarily focuses on robotic systems for detangling hair, with limited exploration into robotic hair styling. This research presents a novel robotic system designed to automatically adjust front hairstyles, with an emphasis on path planning for root-centric strand adjustment. The system utilizes images to compare the current hair state with the desired target state through an orientation map of hair strands. By concentrating on the differences in hair orientation and specifically targeting adjustments at the root of each strand, the system performs detailed styling tasks. The path planning approach ensures effective alignment of the hairstyle with the target, and a closed-loop mechanism refines these adjustments to accurately evolve the hairstyle towards the desired outcome. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a high degree of similarity and consistency in front hair styling, showing promising results for automated, precise hairstyle adjustments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/SICE SII2025</p></details> |

While these abilities may seem impressive, the teaching methods often remain inefficient. To enhance the process of teaching robots, we propose leveraging a mechanism effectively used by humans: teaching by demonstrating. In this paper, we introduce DIRIGENt (DIrect Robotic Imitation GENeration model), a novel end-to-end diffusion approach that directly generates joint values from observing human demonstrations, enabling a robot to imitate these actions without any existing mapping between it and humans. We create a dataset in which humans imitate a robot and then use this collected data to train a diffusion model that enables a robot to imitate humans. The following three aspects are the core of our contribution. First is our novel dataset with natural pairs between human and robot poses, allowing our approach to imitate humans accurately despite the gap between their anatomies. Second, the diffusion input to our model alleviates the challenge of redundant joint configurations, limiting the search space. And finally, our end-to-end architecture from perception to action leads to an improved learning capability. Through our experimental analysis, we show that combining these three aspects allows DIRIGENt to outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches in the field of generating joint values from RGB images.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we present the Strawberry Robotic Operation Interface (SROI), an open-source device designed for collecting dexterous manipulation data in robotic strawberry farming. The SROI features a handheld unit with a modular end effector, a stereo robotic camera, enabling the easy collection of demonstration data in field environments. A data post-processing pipeline is introduced to extract spatial trajectories and gripper states from the collected data.

| **[Benchmarking Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning Based Control for Legged Robot Locomotion in MuJoCo Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16590v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two prominent strategies for controlling legged robots, each with unique strengths. RL learns control policies through system interaction, adapting to various scenarios, whereas MPC relies on a predefined mathematical model to solve optimization problems in real-time. Despite their widespread use, there is a lack of direct comparative analysis under standardized conditions. This work addresses this gap by benchmarking MPC and RL controllers on a Unitree Go1 quadruped robot within the MuJoCo simulation environment, focusing on a standardized task-straight walking at a constant velocity. Performance is evaluated based on disturbance rejection, energy efficiency, and terrain adaptability. The results show that RL excels in handling disturbances and maintaining energy efficiency but struggles with generalization to new terrains due to its dependence on learned policies tailored to specific environments. In contrast, MPC shows enhanced recovery capabilities from larger perturbations by leveraging its optimization-based approach, allowing for a balanced distribution of control efforts across the robot's joints. The results provide a clear understanding of the advantages and limitations of both RL and MPC, offering insights into selecting an appropriate control strategy for legged robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

Our approach employs hierarchical trees to systematically break down complex missions into manageable sub-tasks. We develop specialized APIs and tools, which are utilized by Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently construct these hierarchical trees. Once the hierarchical tree is generated, it is further decomposed to create optimized schedules for each robot, ensuring adherence to their individual constraints and capabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through detailed examples covering a wide range of missions, showcasing its flexibility and scalability.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional robots in manufacturing or logistics, these robots must navigate complex human environments where maintaining appropriate physical and psychological distances is crucial for seamless interaction. This study explores the application of proxemics in human-robot interactions, focusing specifically on quadruped robots, which present unique challenges and opportunities due to their lifelike movement and form. Utilizing a motion capture system, we examine how different interaction postures of a canine robot influence human participants' proxemic behavior in dynamic scenarios. By capturing and analyzing position and orientation data, this research aims to identify key factors that affect proxemic distances and inform the design of socially acceptable robots. The findings underscore the importance of adhering to human psychological and physical distancing norms in robot design, ensuring that autonomous systems can coexist harmoniously with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

This paper presents a new and efficient method for position estimation using a Kalman Filter (KF) combined with the Multivariable Output-Error State Space (MOESP) method for system identification. Unlike traditional approaches that require prior knowledge of the system's dynamics, this study uses the JIGSAW dataset, a comprehensive collection of robotic surgical data, along with input from the Master Tool Manipulator (MTM) to derive the state-space model directly. The MOESP method allows accurate modeling of the Patient Side Manipulator (PSM) dynamics without prior system models, improving the KF's performance under simulated network conditions, including delays, jitter, and packet loss. These conditions mimic real-world challenges in Tactile Internet applications. The findings demonstrate the KF's improved resilience and accuracy in state estimation, achieving over 95 percent accuracy despite network-induced uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.04503</p></details> |

Previous work on robot crowd navigation assumes that the dynamics of all agents are known and well-defined. In addition, the performance of previous methods deteriorates in partially observable environments and environments with dense crowds. To tackle these problems, we propose decentralized structural-Recurrent Neural Network (DS-RNN), a novel network that reasons about spatial and temporal relationships for robot decision making in crowd navigation. We train our network with model-free deep reinforcement learning without any expert supervision. We demonstrate that our model outperforms previous methods in challenging crowd navigation scenarios.

However, current MoMa models are data-inefficient, underscoring the need for improved models that require realistic-sized benchmarks to evaluate their efficiency, which do not exist. To address this, we introduce the LAMBDA ({\lambda}) benchmark (Long-horizon Actions for Mobile-manipulation Benchmarking of Directed Activities), which evaluates the data efficiency of models on language-conditioned, long-horizon, multi-room, multi-floor, pick-and-place tasks using a dataset of manageable size, more feasible for collection. The benchmark includes 571 human-collected demonstrations that provide realism and diversity in simulated and real-world settings. Unlike planner-generated data, these trajectories offer natural variability and replay-verifiability, ensuring robust learning and evaluation. We benchmark several models, including learning-based models and a neuro-symbolic modular approach combining foundation models with task and motion planning. Learning-based models show suboptimal success rates, even when leveraging pretrained weights, underscoring significant data inefficiencies. However, the neuro-symbolic approach performs significantly better while being more data efficient. Findings highlight the need for more data-efficient learning-based MoMa approaches. {\lambda} addresses this gap by serving as a key benchmark for evaluating the data efficiency of those future models in handling household robotics tasks.</p></details> |  |

RP-joint has no actuation, but instead it is lightweight and compact. It can be easily reconfigured by applying external forces and locked to perform complex dexterous manipulation tasks, but only after tension is applied to the connected tendon. Additionally, we present an approach that allows learning dexterous grasps from single examples with underactuated grippers and automatically configures the RP-joints for dexterous manipulation. This is enhanced by integrating kinaesthetic contact optimization, which improves grasp performance even further. The proposed RP-joint gripper and grasp planner have been tested on over 370 grasps executed on 42 IKEA objects and on the YCB object dataset, achieving grasping success rates of 80% and 87%, on IKEA and YCB, respectively.</p></details> |  |

The traditional path planning techniques like DRL models typically trained for a given configuration of the starting point and target positions, these models only perform well when these conditions are satisfied. In this paper, we proposed a novel path planning framework that embeds Large Language Models to empower mobile robots with the capability of dynamically interpreting natural language commands and autonomously generating efficient, collision-free navigation paths. The proposed framework uses LLMs to translate high-level user inputs into actionable waypoints while dynamically adjusting paths in response to obstacles. We experimentally evaluated our proposed LLM-based approach across three different environments of progressive complexity, showing the robustness of our approach with llama3.1 model that outperformed other LLM models in path planning time, waypoint generation success rate, and collision avoidance. This underlines the promising contribution of LLMs for enhancing the capability of mobile robots, especially when their operation involves complex decisions in large and complex environments. Our framework has provided safer, more reliable navigation systems and opened a new direction for the future research.

We explore the possibility of such a system in the context of cooperative 2D push manipulations using mobile robots. Although conventional works demonstrate potential solutions for the problem in restricted settings, they have computational and learning difficulties. More importantly, these systems do not possess the ability to adapt when facing environmental changes. In this work, we show that by distilling a planner derived from a differentiable soft-body physics simulator into an attention-based neural network, our multi-robot push manipulation system achieves better performance than baselines. In addition, our system also generalizes to configurations not seen during training and is able to adapt toward task completions when external turbulence and environmental changes are applied.

This paper aims to enable multi-agent systems to effectively utilize past memories to adapt to novel collaborative tasks in a data-efficient fashion.

Our Transformer-based skill encoder effectively captures spatio-temporal interactions that contribute to coordination and provides a unique skill representation for each coordinated behavior. By leveraging only a small number of demonstrations of the target task, the database enables us to train the policy using a dataset augmented with the retrieved demonstrations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves a significantly higher success rate in push manipulation tasks compared with baseline methods like few-shot imitation learning.

Applications of such systems have witnessed significant advancements in recent years in fields such as healthcare, manufacturing, and post-disaster rescue. The system design at this scale puts stringent constraints on power consumption for both the sensory front-end and actuation back-end and the weight of the electronic assembly for robust operation. In this paper, we introduce FAVbot, the first autonomous mobile micro-robotic system integrated with a novel actuation mechanism and convolutional neural network (CNN) based computer vision - all integrated within a compact 3-cm form factor. The novel actuation mechanism utilizes mechanical resonance phenomenon to achieve frequency-controlled steering with a single piezoelectric actuator. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FAVbot's frequency-controlled actuation, which offers a diverse selection of resonance modes with different motion characteristics. The actuation system is complemented with the vision front-end where a camera along with a microcontroller supports object detection for closed-loop control and autonomous target tracking. This enables adaptive navigation in dynamic environments.

However, existing schemes for the multiple aerial robots transportation system (MARTS) still lack the capability to generate a collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectory in real-time and further track an agile trajectory especially when there are no sensors available to measure the states of payload and cable. Therefore, they are limited to low-agility transportation in simple environments. To bridge the gap, we propose complete planning and control schemes for the MARTS, achieving safe and agile aerial transportation (SAAT) of a cable-suspended payload in complex environments. Flatness maps for the aerial robot considering the complete kinematical constraint and the dynamical coupling between each aerial robot and payload are derived. To improve the responsiveness for the generation of the safe, dynamically feasible, and agile trajectory in complex environments, a real-time spatio-temporal trajectory planning scheme is proposed for the MARTS. Besides, we break away from the reliance on the state measurement for both the payload and cable, as well as the closed-loop control for the payload, and propose a fully distributed control scheme to track the agile trajectory that is robust against imprecise payload mass and non-point mass payload. The proposed schemes are extensively validated through benchmark comparisons, ablation studies, and simulations. Finally, extensive real-world experiments are conducted on a MARTS integrated by three aerial robots with onboard computers and sensors. The result validates the efficiency and robustness of our proposed schemes for SAAT in complex environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 14 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Zero-shot Robotic Manipulation with Language-guided Instruction and Formal Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15214v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation is often challenging due to the long-horizon tasks and the complex object relationships. A common solution is to develop a task and motion planning framework that integrates planning for high-level task and low-level motion. Recently, inspired by the powerful reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based planning approaches have achieved remarkable progress. However, these methods still heavily rely on expert-specific knowledge, often generating invalid plans for unseen and unfamiliar tasks. To address this issue, we propose an innovative language-guided symbolic task planning (LM-SymOpt) framework with optimization. It is the first expert-free planning framework since we combine the world knowledge from LLMs with formal reasoning, resulting in improved generalization capability to new tasks. Specifically, differ to most existing work, our LM-SymOpt employs LLMs to translate natural language instructions into symbolic representations, thereby representing actions as high-level symbols and reducing the search space for planning. Next, after evaluating the action probability of completing the task using LLMs, a weighted random sampling method is introduced to generate candidate plans. Their feasibility is assessed through symbolic reasoning and their cost efficiency is then evaluated using trajectory optimization for selecting the optimal planning. Our experimental results show that LM-SymOpt outperforms existing LLM-based planning approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world robotics face challenges like variability, high-dimensional state spaces, non-linear dependencies, and partial observability. A key issue is non-stationarity of robots, environments, and tasks, leading to performance drops with out-of-distribution data. Unlike current machine learning models, humans adapt quickly to changes and new tasks due to a cognitive architecture that enables systematic generalization and meta-cognition. Human brain's System 1 handles routine tasks unconsciously, while System 2 manages complex tasks consciously, facilitating flexible problem-solving and self-monitoring. For robots to achieve human-like learning and reasoning, they need to integrate causal models, working memory, planning, and metacognitive processing. By incorporating human cognition insights, the next generation of service robots will handle novel situations and monitor themselves to avoid risks and mitigate errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>In: S...</summary><p>In: Science for a Better Tomorrow: Curious 2024 Insights Actions, Springer 2025</p></details> |

Researchers have proposed building robots with compliant bodies to enhance robustness, but this approach often sacrifices the autonomous capabilities expected of rigid robots. Inspired by tensegrity architecture, we introduce a tensegrity robot -- a hybrid robot made from rigid struts and elastic tendons -- that demonstrates the advantages of compliance and the autonomy necessary for task performance. This robot boasts impact resistance and autonomy in a field environment and additional advances in the state of the art, including surviving harsh impacts from drops (at least 5.7 m), accurately reconstructing its shape and orientation using on-board sensors, achieving high locomotion speeds (18 bar lengths per minute), and climbing the steepest incline of any tensegrity robot (28 degrees). We characterize the robot's locomotion on unstructured terrain, showcase its autonomous capabilities in navigation tasks, and demonstrate its robustness by rolling it off a cliff.</p></details> |  |

This decomposition enables the reuse of learned skills in varying contexts and the combination of acquired skills to perform novel tasks, rather than merely replicating demonstrated motions. Gaze, an evolutionary tool for understanding ongoing events, plays a critical role in human object manipulation, where it strongly correlates with motion planning. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust task decomposition method based on gaze transitions. We hypothesize that an imitation agent's gaze control, fixating on specific landmarks and transitioning between them, naturally segments demonstrated manipulations into sub-tasks. Notably, our method achieves consistent task decomposition across all demonstrations, which is desirable in contexts such as machine learning. Using teleoperation, a common modality in imitation learning for robotic manipulation, we collected demonstration data for various tasks, applied our segmentation method, and evaluated the characteristics and consistency of the resulting sub-tasks. Furthermore, through extensive testing across a wide range of hyperparameter variations, we demonstrated that the proposed method possesses the robustness necessary for application to different robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, collecting large datasets for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neuro-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Scaling Laws in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14005v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural scaling laws have driven significant advancements in machine learning, particularly in domains like language modeling and computer vision. However, the exploration of neural scaling laws within robotics has remained relatively underexplored, despite the growing adoption of foundation models in this field. This paper represents the first comprehensive study to quantify neural scaling laws for Robot Foundation Models (RFMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in robotics tasks. Through a meta-analysis of 327 research papers, we investigate how data size, model size, and compute resources influence downstream performance across a diverse set of robotic tasks. Consistent with previous scaling law research, our results reveal that the performance of robotic models improves with increased resources, following a power-law relationship. Promisingly, the improvement in robotic task performance scales notably faster than language tasks. This suggests that, while performance on downstream robotic tasks today is often moderate-to-poor, increased data and compute are likely to signficantly improve performance in the future. Also consistent with previous scaling law research, we also observe the emergence of new robot capabilities as models scale.</p></details> |  |

However, complex tasks like welding and pipe insertion pose challenges due to their need for precise adaptive force control, which complicates robotic training. This paper proposes a two-phase system to improve robot learning, integrating human-derived force feedback. The first phase captures real-time data from operators using a robot arm linked with a virtual simulator via ROS-Sharp. In the second phase, this feedback is converted into robotic motion instructions, using a generative approach to incorporate force feedback into the learning process. This method's effectiveness is demonstrated through improved task completion times and success rates. The framework simulates realistic force-based interactions, enhancing the training data's quality for precise robotic manipulation in construction tasks.</p></details> | 36 pages |

Although many solutions have been proposed that ensure safety and resolve deadlocks, optimally preventing deadlocks in a minimally invasive and decentralized fashion remains an open problem. We first formalize the objective as a non-cooperative, non-communicative, partially observable multi-robot navigation problem in constrained spaces with multiple conflicting agents, which we term as social mini-games. Formally, we solve a discrete-time optimal receding horizon control problem leveraging control barrier functions for safe long-horizon planning. Our approach to ensuring liveness rests on the insight that \textit{there exists barrier certificates that allow each robot to preemptively perturb their state in a minimally-invasive fashion onto liveness sets i.e. states where robots are deadlock-free}. We evaluate our approach in simulation as well on physical robots using F$1/10$ robots, a Clearpath Jackal, as well as a Boston Dynamics Spot in a doorway, hallway, and corridor intersection scenario. Compared to both fully decentralized and centralized approaches with and without deadlock resolution capabilities, we demonstrate that our approach results in safer, more efficient, and smoother navigation, based on a comprehensive set of metrics including success rate, collision rate, stop time, change in velocity, path deviation, time-to-goal, and flow rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>major...</summary><p>major update since last revision</p></details> |
| **[A Predictive Approach for Enhancing Accuracy in Remote Robotic Surgery Using Informer Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14678v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise and real-time estimation of the robotic arm's position on the patient's side is essential for the success of remote robotic surgery in Tactile Internet (TI) environments. This paper presents a prediction model based on the Transformer-based Informer framework for accurate and efficient position estimation. Additionally, it combines a Four-State Hidden Markov Model (4-State HMM) to simulate realistic packet loss scenarios. The proposed approach addresses challenges such as network delays, jitter, and packet loss to ensure reliable and precise operation in remote surgical applications. The method integrates the optimization problem into the Informer model by embedding constraints such as energy efficiency, smoothness, and robustness into its training process using a differentiable optimization layer. The Informer framework uses features such as ProbSparse attention, attention distilling, and a generative-style decoder to focus on position-critical features while maintaining a low computational complexity of O(L log L). The method is evaluated using the JIGSAWS dataset, achieving a prediction accuracy of over 90 percent under various network scenarios. A comparison with models such as TCN, RNN, and LSTM demonstrates the Informer framework's superior performance in handling position prediction and meeting real-time requirements, making it suitable for Tactile Internet-enabled robotic surgery.</p></details> |  |

Model-based visual reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in addressing these challenges but still faces notable limitations, particularly in handling sparse rewards and complex visual features in long-horizon environments. To address these limitations, we propose the Recognize-Sense-Plan-Act (RSPA) pipeline for long-horizon tasks and further introduce RoboHorizon, an LLM-assisted multi-view world model tailored for long-horizon robotic manipulation. In RoboHorizon, pre-trained LLMs generate dense reward structures for multi-stage sub-tasks based on task language instructions, enabling robots to better recognize long-horizon tasks. Keyframe discovery is then integrated into the multi-view masked autoencoder (MAE) architecture to enhance the robot's ability to sense critical task sequences, strengthening its multi-stage perception of long-horizon processes. Leveraging these dense rewards and multi-view representations, a robotic world model is constructed to efficiently plan long-horizon tasks, enabling the robot to reliably act through RL algorithms. Experiments on two representative benchmarks, RLBench and FurnitureBench, show that RoboHorizon outperforms state-of-the-art visual model-based RL methods, achieving a 23.35% improvement in task success rates on RLBench's 4 short-horizon tasks and a 29.23% improvement on 6 long-horizon tasks from RLBench and 3 furniture assembly tasks from FurnitureBench.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Learning more with the same effort: how randomization improves the robustness of a robotic deep reinforcement learning agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14443v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The industrial application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is frequently slowed down because of the inability to generate the experience required to train the models. Collecting data often involves considerable time and economic effort that is unaffordable in most cases. Fortunately, devices like robots can be trained with synthetic experience thanks to virtual environments. With this approach, the sample efficiency problems of artificial agents are mitigated, but another issue arises: the need for efficiently transferring the synthetic experience into the real world (sim-to-real). This paper analyzes the robustness of a state-of-the-art sim-to-real technique known as progressive neural networks (PNNs) and studies how adding diversity to the synthetic experience can complement it. To better understand the drivers that lead to a lack of robustness, the robotic agent is still tested in a virtual environment to ensure total control on the divergence between the simulated and real models. The results show that a PNN-like agent exhibits a substantial decrease in its robustness at the beginning of the real training phase. Randomizing certain variables during simulation-based training significantly mitigates this issue. On average, the increase in the model's accuracy is around 25% when diversity is introduced in the training process. This improvement can be translated into a decrease in the required real experience for the same final robustness performance. Notwithstanding, adding real experience to agents should still be beneficial regardless of the quality of the virtual experience fed into the agent.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article was accepted and published in Applied Intelligence (10.1007/s10489-022-04227-3)</p></details> |

Robotic systems with long kinematic chains are required to reach complex workspaces, including floors, walls, and ceilings. These requirements significantly impact positioning accuracy due to effects such as deflection and backlash in various parts along the kinematic chain. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates deflection and backlash compensation models with high-accuracy accelerometers, significantly enhancing position accuracy. Our method employs a modular framework based on a factor graph formulation to estimate the state of the kinematic chain, leveraging acceleration measurements to inform the model. Extensive testing on publicly released datasets, reflecting real-world construction disturbances, demonstrates the advantages of our approach. The proposed method reduces the $95\%$ error threshold in the xy-plane by $50\%$ compared to the state-of-the-art Virtual Joint Method, and by $31\%$ when incorporating base tilt compensation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, Accepted on November 2024 at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |
| **[You Only Teach Once: Learn One-Shot Bimanual Robotic Manipulation from Video Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14208v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bimanual robotic manipulation is a long-standing challenge of embodied intelligence due to its characteristics of dual-arm spatial-temporal coordination and high-dimensional action spaces. Previous studies rely on pre-defined action taxonomies or direct teleoperation to alleviate or circumvent these issues, often making them lack simplicity, versatility and scalability. Differently, we believe that the most effective and efficient way for teaching bimanual manipulation is learning from human demonstrated videos, where rich features such as spatial-temporal positions, dynamic postures, interaction states and dexterous transitions are available almost for free. In this work, we propose the YOTO (You Only Teach Once), which can extract and then inject patterns of bimanual actions from as few as a single binocular observation of hand movements, and teach dual robot arms various complex tasks. Furthermore, based on keyframes-based motion trajectories, we devise a subtle solution for rapidly generating training demonstrations with diverse variations of manipulated objects and their locations. These data can then be used to learn a customized bimanual diffusion policy (BiDP) across diverse scenes. In experiments, YOTO achieves impressive performance in mimicking 5 intricate long-horizon bimanual tasks, possesses strong generalization under different visual and spatial conditions, and outperforms existing visuomotor imitation learning methods in accuracy and efficiency.

However, efficient real-time map reconstruction with data streamed from multiple robots and devices remains a challenge. To that end, we propose HAMMER, a server-based collaborative Gaussian Splatting method that leverages widely available ROS communication infrastructure to generate 3D, metric-semantic maps from asynchronous robot data-streams with no prior knowledge of initial robot positions and varying on-device pose estimators. HAMMER consists of (i) a frame alignment module that transforms local SLAM poses and image data into a global frame and requires no prior relative pose knowledge, and (ii) an online module for training semantic 3DGS maps from streaming data. HAMMER handles mixed perception modes, adjusts automatically for variations in image pre-processing among different devices, and distills CLIP semantic codes into the 3D scene for open-vocabulary language queries. In our real-world experiments, HAMMER creates higher-fidelity maps (2x) compared to competing baselines and is useful for downstream tasks, such as semantic goal-conditioned navigation (e.g., ``go to the couch").

| **[Entanglement Definitions for Tethered Robots: Exploration and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04909v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article we consider the problem of tether entanglement for tethered mobile robots. One of the main risks of using a tethered connection between a mobile robot and an anchor point is that the tether may get entangled with the obstacles present in the environment or with itself. To avoid these situations, a non-entanglement constraint can be considered in the motion planning problem for tethered robots. This constraint is typically expressed as a set of specific tether configurations that must be avoided. However, the literature lacks a generally accepted definition of entanglement, with existing definitions being limited and partial in the sense that they only focus on specific instances of entanglement. In practice, this means that the existing definitions do not effectively cover all instances of tether entanglement. Our goal in this article is to bridge this gap and to provide new definitions of entanglement, which, together with the existing ones, can be effectively used to qualify the entanglement state of a tethered robot in diverse situations. The new definitions find application in motion planning for tethered robots, where they can be used to obtain more safe and robust entanglement-free trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures.

Recently, various attacks against such robotic policies have been proposed, with backdoor attacks drawing considerable attention for their high stealth and strong persistence capabilities. However, existing backdoor efforts are limited to simulators and suffer from physical-world realization. To address this, we propose \textit{TrojanRobot}, a highly stealthy and broadly effective robotic backdoor attack in the physical world. Specifically, we introduce a module-poisoning approach by embedding a backdoor module into the modular robotic policy, enabling backdoor control over the policy's visual perception module thereby backdooring the entire robotic policy. Our vanilla implementation leverages a backdoor-finetuned VLM to serve as the backdoor module. To enhance its generalization in physical environments, we propose a prime implementation, leveraging the LVLM-as-a-backdoor paradigm and developing three types of prime attacks, \ie, \textit{permutation}, \textit{stagnation}, and \textit{intentional} attacks, thus achieving finer-grained backdoors. Extensive experiments on the UR3e manipulator with 18 task instructions using robotic policies based on four VLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness and physical-world stealth of TrojanRobot. Our attack's video demonstrations are available via a github link \url{https://trojanrobot.github.io}.</p></details> |  |

This skill allows them to communicate more easily in crowded environments, especially in caregiving and customer service roles. Generating a Persian Lip-reading dataset, this study integrates Persian lip-reading technology into the Surena-V humanoid robot to improve its speech recognition capabilities. Two complementary methods are explored, an indirect method using facial landmark tracking and a direct method leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The indirect method focuses on tracking key facial landmarks, especially around the lips, to infer movements, while the direct method processes raw video data for action and speech recognition. The best-performing model, LSTM, achieved 89\% accuracy and has been successfully implemented into the Surena-V robot for real-time human-robot interaction. The study highlights the effectiveness of these methods, particularly in environments where verbal communication is limited.</p></details> |  |

Their ability to adapt to surroundings, combined with advancements in actuation and manufacturing technologies, allows them to perform specialized manipulation tasks. This work presents an approach for design optimization of soft growing robots; specifically, the three-dimensional extension of the optimizer designed for planar manipulators. This tool is intended to be used by engineers and robot enthusiasts before manufacturing their robot: it suggests the optimal size of the robot for solving a specific task. The design process models a multi-objective optimization problem to refine a soft manipulator's kinematic chain. Thanks to the novel Rank Partitioning algorithm integrated into Evolutionary Computation (EC) algorithms, this method achieves high precision in reaching targets and is efficient in resource usage. Results show significantly high performance in solving three-dimensional tasks, whereas comparative experiments indicate that the optimizer features robust output when tested with different EC algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled precise 3D mapping and scene understanding by rendering photo-realistic images. However, existing 3DGS methods often struggle to accurately reconstruct a 3D map that reflects the actual scale and geometry of the real world, which degrades localization performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS method called Geometry-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GeomGS). This method fully integrates LiDAR data into 3D Gaussian primitives via a probabilistic approach, as opposed to approaches that only use LiDAR as initial points or introduce simple constraints for Gaussian points. To this end, we introduce a Geometric Confidence Score (GCS), which identifies the structural reliability of each Gaussian point. The GCS is optimized simultaneously with Gaussians under probabilistic distance constraints to construct a precise structure. Furthermore, we propose a novel localization method that fully utilizes both the geometric and photometric properties of GeomGS. Our GeomGS demonstrates state-of-the-art geometric and localization performance across several benchmarks, while also improving photometric performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

This work investigates how robot-initiated small talk influences task performance, rapport, and interaction dynamics in human-robot collaboration. We developed an autonomous robot system that assists a human in an assembly task while initiating and engaging in small talk. A user study ($N = 58$) was conducted in which participants worked with either a functional robot, which engaged in only task-oriented speech, or a social robot, which also initiated small talk. Our study found that participants in the social condition reported significantly higher levels of rapport with the robot. Moreover, all participants in the social condition responded to the robot's small talk attempts; 59% initiated questions to the robot, and 73% engaged in lingering conversations after requesting the final task item. Although active working times were similar across conditions, participants in the social condition recorded longer task durations than those in the functional condition. We discuss the design and implications of robot small talk in shaping human-robot collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, preprint for HRI25, the 20th edition of the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction</p></details> |
| **[Safe and Efficient Robot Action Planning in the Presence of Unconcerned Humans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13203v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a robot action planning scheme that provides an efficient and probabilistically safe plan for a robot interacting with an unconcerned human -- someone who is either unaware of the robot's presence or unwilling to engage in ensuring safety. The proposed scheme is predictive, meaning that the robot is required to predict human actions over a finite future horizon; such predictions are often inaccurate in real-world scenarios. One possible approach to reduce the uncertainties is to provide the robot with the capability of reasoning about the human's awareness of potential dangers. This paper discusses that by using a binary variable, so-called danger awareness coefficient, it is possible to differentiate between concerned and unconcerned humans, and provides a learning algorithm to determine this coefficient by observing human actions. Moreover, this paper argues how humans rely on predictions of other agents' future actions (including those of robots in human-robot interaction) in their decision-making. It also shows that ignoring this aspect in predicting human's future actions can significantly degrade the efficiency of the interaction, causing agents to deviate from their optimal paths. The proposed robot action planning scheme is verified and validated via extensive simulation and experimental studies on a LoCoBot WidowX-250.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically rely on gate-cycle priors or designated contact sensors. We design a contact estimator that is suitable for the emerging wheeled-biped robot types that do not have these features. To this end, we propose a Bayes filter in which update steps are learned from real-robot torque measurements while prediction steps rely on inertial measurements. We evaluate this approach in extensive real-robot and simulation experiments. Our method achieves better performance while being considerably more sample efficient than a comparable deep-learning baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[A 3-Step Optimization Framework with Hybrid Models for a Humanoid Robot's Jump Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12594v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High dynamic jump motions are challenging tasks for humanoid robots to achieve environment adaptation and obstacle crossing. The trajectory optimization is a practical method to achieve high-dynamic and explosive jumping. This paper proposes a 3-step trajectory optimization framework for generating a jump motion for a humanoid robot. To improve iteration speed and achieve ideal performance, the framework comprises three sub-optimizations. The first optimization incorporates momentum, inertia, and center of pressure (CoP), treating the robot as a static reaction momentum pendulum (SRMP) model to generate corresponding trajectories. The second optimization maps these trajectories to joint space using effective Quadratic Programming (QP) solvers. Finally, the third optimization generates whole-body joint trajectories utilizing trajectories generated by previous parts. With the combined consideration of momentum and inertia, the robot achieves agile forward jump motions. A simulation and experiments (Fig. \ref{Fig First page fig}) of forward jump with a distance of 1.0 m and 0.5 m height are presented in this paper, validating the applicability of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

For robots to interact more naturally with humans, robot movement design should likewise integrate expressive qualities, such as intention, attention, and emotions, alongside traditional functional considerations like task fulfillment and time efficiency. In this paper, we present the design and prototyping of a lamp-like robot that explores the interplay between functional and expressive objectives in movement design. Using a research-through-design methodology, we document the hardware design process, define expressive movement primitives, and outline a set of interaction scenario storyboards. We propose a framework that incorporates both functional and expressive utilities during movement generation, and implement the robot behavior sequences in different function- and social- oriented tasks. Through a user study comparing expression-driven versus function-driven movements across six task scenarios, our findings indicate that expression-driven movements significantly enhance user engagement and perceived robot qualities. This effect is especially pronounced in social-oriented tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, manuscript under review</p></details> |

To improve the understanding of the robot, we have developed four levels of explanation (LOE) based on two questions: what needs to be explained, and why the robot has made a particular decision. The understandable robot requires a communicative action when there is disparity between the human s mental model of the robot and the robots state of mind.

| **[Evaluating Efficiency and Engagement in Scripted and LLM-Enhanced Human-Robot Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12128v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To achieve natural and intuitive interaction with people, HRI frameworks combine a wide array of methods for human perception, intention communication, human-aware navigation and collaborative action. In practice, when encountering unpredictable behavior of people or unexpected states of the environment, these frameworks may lack the ability to dynamically recognize such states, adapt and recover to resume the interaction. Large Language Models (LLMs), owing to their advanced reasoning capabilities and context retention, present a promising solution for enhancing robot adaptability. This potential, however, may not directly translate to improved interaction metrics. This paper considers a representative interaction with an industrial robot involving approach, instruction, and object manipulation, implemented in two conditions: (1) fully scripted and (2) including LLM-enhanced responses. We use gaze tracking and questionnaires to measure the participants' task efficiency, engagement, and robot perception. The results indicate higher subjective ratings for the LLM condition, but objective metrics show that the scripted condition performs comparably, particularly in efficiency and focus during simple tasks. We also note that the scripted condition may have an edge over LLM-enhanced responses in terms of response latency and energy consumption, especially for trivial and repetitive interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Late-Breaking Report to the 2025, 20th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)</p></details> |
| **[Towards autonomous photogrammetric forest inventory using a lightweight under-canopy robotic drone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12073v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drones are increasingly used in forestry to capture high-resolution remote sensing data. While operations above the forest canopy are already highly automated, flying inside forests remains challenging, primarily relying on manual piloting. Inside dense forests, reliance on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for localization is not feasible. Additionally, the drone must autonomously adjust its flight path to avoid collisions. Recently, advancements in robotics have enabled autonomous drone flights in GNSS-denied obstacle-rich areas. In this article, a step towards autonomous forest data collection is taken by building a prototype of a robotic under-canopy drone utilizing state-of-the-art open-source methods and validating its performance for data collection inside forests. The autonomous flight capability was evaluated through multiple test flights in two boreal forest test sites. The tree parameter estimation capability was studied by conducting diameter at breast height (DBH) estimation using onboard stereo camera data and photogrammetric methods. The prototype conducted flights in selected challenging forest environments, and the experiments showed excellent performance in forest reconstruction with a miniaturized stereoscopic photogrammetric system. The stem detection algorithm managed to identify 79.31 % of the stems. The DBH estimation had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.33 cm (12.79 %) and a bias of 1.01 cm (3.87 %) across all trees. For trees with a DBH less than 30 cm, the RMSE was 1.16 cm (5.74 %), and the bias was 0.13 cm (0.64 %). When considering the overall performance in terms of DBH accuracy, autonomy, and forest complexity, the proposed approach was superior compared to methods proposed in the scientific literature. Results provided valuable insights into autonomous forest reconstruction using drones, and several further development topics were proposed.</p></details> | 35 pages, 13 Figures |

Our software is able to handle large numbers of objects and materials in real-time, making it suitable for use in a variety of mobile robotics applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RadaRays through a series of experiments and show that it can more accurately reproduce the behavior of FMCW radar sensors in a variety of environments, compared to the ray casting-based lidar-like simulations that are commonly used in simulators for autonomous driving such as CARLA. Our experiments additionally serve as a valuable reference point for researchers to evaluate their own radar simulations. By using RadaRays, developers can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with prototyping and testing FMCW radar-based algorithms. We also provide a Gazebo plugin that makes our work accessible to the mobile robotics community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concurrent-Learning Based Relative Localization in Shape Formation of Robot Swarms (Extended version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06052v4)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the shape formation problem for massive robot swarms in environments where external localization systems are unavailable. Achieving this task effectively with solely onboard measurements is still scarcely explored and faces some practical challenges. To solve this challenging problem, we propose the following novel results. Firstly, to estimate the relative positions among neighboring robots, a concurrent-learning based estimator is proposed. It relaxes the persistent excitation condition required in the classical ones such as least-square estimator. Secondly, we introduce a finite-time agreement protocol to determine the shape location. This is achieved by estimating the relative position between each robot and a randomly assigned seed robot. The initial position of the seed one marks the shape location. Thirdly, based on the theoretical results of the relative localization, a novel behavior-based control strategy is devised. This strategy not only enables adaptive shape formation of large group of robots but also enhances the observability of inter-robot relative localization. Numerical simulation results are provided to verify the performance of our proposed strategy compared to the state-of-the-art ones. Additionally, outdoor experiments on real robots further demonstrate the practical effectiveness and robustness of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating Robot Swarm Through a Virtual Tube with Flow-Adaptive Distribution Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11938v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of robot swarm technology and its diverse applications, navigating robot swarms through complex environments has emerged as a critical research direction. To ensure safe navigation and avoid potential collisions with obstacles, the concept of virtual tubes has been introduced to define safe and navigable regions. However, current control methods in virtual tubes face the congestion issues, particularly in narrow virtual tubes with low throughput. To address these challenges, we first originally introduce the concepts of virtual tube area and flow capacity, and develop an new evolution model for the spatial density function. Next, we propose a novel control method that combines a modified artificial potential field (APF) for swarm navigation and density feedback control for distribution regulation, under which a saturated velocity command is designed. Then, we generate a global velocity field that not only ensures collision-free navigation through the virtual tube, but also achieves locally input-to-state stability (LISS) for density tracking errors, both of which are rigorously proven. Finally, numerical simulations and realistic applications validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method in managing robot swarms within narrow virtual tubes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Connection-Coordination Rapport (CCR) Scale: A Dual-Factor Scale to Measure Human-Robot Rapport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11887v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots, particularly in service and companionship roles, must develop positive relationships with people they interact with regularly to be successful. These positive human-robot relationships can be characterized as establishing "rapport," which indicates mutual understanding and interpersonal connection that form the groundwork for successful long-term human-robot interaction. However, the human-robot interaction research literature lacks scale instruments to assess human-robot rapport in a variety of situations. In this work, we developed the 18-item Connection-Coordination Rapport (CCR) Scale to measure human-robot rapport. We first ran Study 1 (N = 288) where online participants rated videos of human-robot interactions using a set of candidate items. Our Study 1 results showed the discovery of two factors in our scale, which we named "Connection" and "Coordination." We then evaluated this scale by running Study 2 (N = 201) where online participants rated a new set of human-robot interaction videos with our scale and an existing rapport scale from virtual agents research for comparison. We also validated our scale by replicating a prior in-person human-robot interaction study, Study 3 (N = 44), and found that rapport is rated significantly greater when participants interacted with a responsive robot (responsive condition) as opposed to an unresponsive robot (unresponsive condition). Results from these studies demonstrate high reliability and validity for the CCR scale, which can be used to measure rapport in both first-person and third-person perspectives. We encourage the adoption of this scale in future studies to measure rapport in a variety of human-robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Force-Aware Autonomous Robotic Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11742v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work demonstrates the benefits of using tool-tissue interaction forces in the design of autonomous systems in robot-assisted surgery (RAS). Autonomous systems in surgery must manipulate tissues of different stiffness levels and hence should apply different levels of forces accordingly. We hypothesize that this ability is enabled by using force measurements as input to policies learned from human demonstrations. To test this hypothesis, we use Action-Chunking Transformers (ACT) to train two policies through imitation learning for automated tissue retraction with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). To quantify the effects of using tool-tissue interaction force data, we trained a "no force policy" that uses the vision and robot kinematic data, and compared it to a "force policy" that uses force, vision and robot kinematic data. When tested on a previously seen tissue sample, the force policy is 3 times more successful in autonomously performing the task compared with the no force policy. In addition, the force policy is more gentle with the tissue compared with the no force policy, exerting on average 62% less force on the tissue. When tested on a previously unseen tissue sample, the force policy is 3.5 times more successful in autonomously performing the task, exerting an order of magnitude less forces on the tissue, compared with the no force policy. These results open the door to design force-aware autonomous systems that can meet the surgical guidelines for tissue handling, especially using the newly released RAS systems with force feedback capabilities such as the da Vinci 5.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Semidefinite Relaxations for Matrix-Weighted State-Estimation Problems in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07275v4)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in the development of so-called certifiable perception methods, which leverage semidefinite, convex relaxations to find global optima of perception problems in robotics. However, many of these relaxations rely on simplifying assumptions that facilitate the problem formulation, such as an isotropic measurement noise distribution. In this paper, we explore the tightness of the semidefinite relaxations of matrix-weighted (anisotropic) state-estimation problems and reveal the limitations lurking therein: matrix-weighted factors can cause convex relaxations to lose tightness. In particular, we show that the semidefinite relaxations of localization problems with matrix weights may be tight only for low noise levels. To better understand this issue, we introduce a theoretical connection between the posterior uncertainty of the state estimate and the certificate matrix obtained via convex relaxation. With this connection in mind, we empirically explore the factors that contribute to this loss of tightness and demonstrate that redundant constraints can be used to regain it. As a second technical contribution of this paper, we show that the state-of-the-art relaxation of scalar-weighted SLAM cannot be used when matrix weights are considered. We provide an alternate formulation and show that its SDP relaxation is not tight (even for very low noise levels) unless specific redundant constraints are used. We demonstrate the tightness of our formulations on both simulated and real-world data.</p></details> |  |

The scenarios highlight how personalization can be achieved through more human-robot collaboration, particularly in relation to individuals with visual, physical, cognitive, auditory impairments, clinical needs, environmental factors (noise, light levels, clutter), and daily living activities. Our goal is for this contribution to prompt reflection and aid in the design of improved robots (embodiment, sensors, actuation, cognition) and their behavior, and we aim to introduces a groundbreaking strategy to enhance human-robot collaboration, addressing the complexities of decision-making under uncertainty through a Scenario analysis approach. By emphasizing user-centered design principles and offering actionable solutions to real-world challenges, this work aims to identify key decision-making challenges and propose potential solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TAROS 2024</p></details> |

We develop a novel algorithm that leverages the presence of other assistive devices: a Hoyer sling and a wheelchair for coarse manipulation of heavy loads, alongside a robot arm for fine-grained manipulation of deformable objects (Hoyer sling straps). We instrument the Hoyer sling and wheelchair with actuators and sensors so that they can become intelligent agents in the algorithm. We then focus on one subtask of the transferring ADL -- tying Hoyer sling straps to the sling bar -- that exemplifies the challenges of transfer: multi-agent planning, deformable object manipulation, and generalization to varying hook shapes, sling materials, and care recipient bodies. To address these challenges, we propose CART-MPC, a novel algorithm based on turn-taking multi-agent model predictive control that uses a learned neural dynamics model for a keypoint-based representation of the deformable Hoyer sling strap, and a novel cost function that leverages linking numbers from knot theory and neural amortization to accelerate inference. We validate it in both RCareWorld simulation and real-world environments. In simulation, CART-MPC successfully generalizes across diverse hook designs, sling materials, and care recipient body shapes. In the real world, we show zero-shot sim-to-real generalization capabilities to tie deformable Hoyer sling straps on a sling bar towards transferring a manikin from a hospital bed to a wheelchair.

| **[REBEL: Reward Regularization-Based Approach for Robotic Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14436v3)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in continuous control robotics tasks is mainly dependent on the design of the underlying reward function, which is highly prone to reward hacking. A misalignment between the reward function and underlying human preferences (values, social norms) can lead to catastrophic outcomes in the real world especially in the context of robotics for critical decision making. Recent methods aim to mitigate misalignment by learning reward functions from human preferences and subsequently performing policy optimization. However, these methods inadvertently introduce a distribution shift during reward learning due to ignoring the dependence of agent-generated trajectories on the reward learning objective, ultimately resulting in sub-optimal alignment. Hence, in this work, we address this challenge by advocating for the adoption of regularized reward functions that more accurately mirror the intended behaviors of the agent. We propose a novel concept of reward regularization within the robotic RLHF (RL from Human Feedback) framework, which we refer to as \emph{agent preferences}. Our approach uniquely incorporates not just human feedback in the form of preferences but also considers the preferences of the RL agent itself during the reward function learning process. This dual consideration significantly mitigates the issue of distribution shift in RLHF with a computationally tractable algorithm. We provide a theoretical justification for the proposed algorithm by formulating the robotic RLHF problem as a bilevel optimization problem and developing a computationally tractable version of the same. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm {\ours} in several continuous control benchmarks in DeepMind Control Suite \cite{tassa2018deepmind}.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies have attempted to address this issue through the development of a new BC technique: Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC). This new technique consistently outperformed the conventional Mean Squared Error (MSE) BC models in a variety of tasks. Our goal is to replicate the performance of the IBC model by Florence [in Proceedings of the 5th Conference on Robot Learning, 164:158-168, 2022], for social interaction tasks using our custom dataset. While previous studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for enhancing group conversations, they often overlook the significance of non-verbal cues, which constitute a substantial part of human communication. We propose using IBC to replicate nonverbal cues like gaze behaviors. The model is evaluated against various types of facilitator data and compared to an explicit, MSE BC model. Results show that the IBC model outperforms the MSE BC model across session types using the same metrics used in the previous IBC paper. Despite some metrics showing mixed results which are explainable for the custom dataset for social interaction, we successfully replicated the IBC model to generate nonverbal cues. Our contributions are (1) the replication and extension of the IBC model, and (2) a nonverbal cues generation model for social interaction. These advancements facilitate the integration of robots into the complex interactions between robots and humans, e.g., in the absence of a human facilitator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to as a short contribution to HRI2025</p></details> |

A good replacement for human intervention can be offered by climbing robots. The different solutions existing in the literature are not up to the task for the difficulty of the requirements (navigation, heavy payloads, flexibility in the execution of the tasks). In this paper, we propose a robotic platform that can fill this gap. Our solution is based on a robot that hangs on ropes, and uses a retractable leg to jump away from the mountain walls. Our package of mechanical solutions, along with the algorithms developed for motion planning and control, delivers swift navigation on irregular and steep slopes, the possibility to overcome or travel around significant natural barriers, and the ability to carry heavy payloads and execute complex tasks. In the paper, we give a full account of our main design and algorithmic choices and show the feasibility of the solution through a large number of physically simulated scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Thus, this work presents a novel SME-AGOL to address such problems. Firstly, Sequential Motion Executor (SME) is a three-layer interpretable neural network, where the first produces the sequentially propagating hidden states, the second constructs the corresponding triangular bases with minor non-neighbor interference, and the third maps the bases to the motor commands. Secondly, the Adaptable Gradient-weighting Online Learning (AGOL) algorithm prioritizes the update of the parameters with high relevance score, allowing the learning to focus more on the highly relevant ones. Thus, these two components lead to an analyzable framework, where each sequential hidden state/basis represents the learned key poses/robot configuration. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the SME-AGOL requires 40% fewer samples and receives 150% higher final reward/locomotion performance on a simulated hexapod robot, while taking merely 10 minutes of learning time from scratch on a physical hexapod robot. Taken together, this work not only proposes the SME-AGOL for sample efficient and understandable locomotion learning but also emphasizes the potential exploitation of interpretability for improving sample efficiency and learning performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 Figures + 6 Figures in supplementary material section, 2 Tables, submitted to TNNLS (minor revision; revision submitted 5 October 2024)</p></details> |

Leaf-level hyperspectral spectroscopy is shown to be a powerful tool for phenotyping, monitoring crop health, identifying essential nutrients within plants as well as detecting diseases and water stress. This work introduces RoMu4o, a robotic manipulation unit for orchard operations offering an automated solution for proximal hyperspectral leaf sensing. This ground robot is equipped with a 6DOF robotic arm and vision system for real-time deep learning-based image processing and motion planning. We developed robust perception and manipulation pipelines that enable the robot to successfully grasp target leaves and perform spectroscopy. These frameworks operate synergistically to identify and extract the 3D structure of leaves from an observed batch of foliage, propose 6D poses, and generate collision-free constraint-aware paths for precise leaf manipulation. The end-effector of the arm features a compact design that integrates an independent lighting source with a hyperspectral sensor, enabling high-fidelity data acquisition while streamlining the calibration process for accurate measurements. Our ground robot is engineered to operate in unstructured orchard environments. However, the performance of the system is evaluated in both indoor and outdoor plant models. The system demonstrated reliable performance for 1-LPB hyperspectral sampling, achieving 95% success rate in lab trials and 79% in field trials. Field experiments revealed an overall success rate of 70% for autonomous leaf grasping and hyperspectral measurement in a pistachio orchard.

Current robot deployments, which oftentimes rely on static configurations (of the OS, applications, etc.) and system over-provisioning, fall short since they do not account for the tasks' performance variations resulting in poor system-wide behavior such as robot instability and/or inefficient resource use. This paper presents ConfigBot, a system designed to adaptively reconfigure AMSR applications to meet a predefined performance specification by leveraging runtime profiling and automated configuration tuning. Through experiments on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot equipped with NVIDIA AGX Orin, we demonstrate ConfigBot's efficacy in maintaining system stability and optimizing resource allocation across diverse scenarios.

Its strength is based on the passivity theorem, which provides a powerful interconnection framework for robotics. However, the design of passivity-based controllers and their optimal tuning remain challenging. We propose here an intuitive design approach for fully actuated robots, where the control action is determined by a `virtual-mechanism' as in classical virtual model control. The result is a robot whose controlled behavior can be understood in terms of physics. We achieve optimal tuning by applying algorithmic differentiation to ODE simulations of the rigid body dynamics. Overall, this leads to a flexible design and optimization approach: stability is proven by passivity of the virtual mechanism, while performance is obtained by optimization using algorithmic differentiation.</p></details> | 14 pages, 17 figures |

We propose a non-autoregressive transformer architecture to leverage its parallel nature for easier training and fast, accurate predictions at test time. The proposed architecture divides human motion prediction into two parts: 1) the human trajectory, which is the hip joint 3D position over time and 2) the human pose which is the all other joints 3D positions over time with respect to a fixed hip joint. We propose to make the two predictions simultaneously, as the shared representation can improve the model performance. Therefore, the model consists of two sets of encoders and decoders. First, a multi-head attention module applied to encoder outputs improves human trajectory. Second, another multi-head self-attention module applied to encoder outputs concatenated with decoder outputs facilitates learning of temporal dependencies. Our model is well-suited for robotic applications in terms of test accuracy and speed, and compares favorably with respect to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our work via the Robot Follow-Ahead task, a challenging yet practical case study for our proposed model.</p></details> |  |

The system, named SPLITTER, comprises two sub-10 kg quadrupedal robots connected by a tether, capable of executing successive jumping gaits and stabilizing in-flight using inertial morphing technology. Through model predictive control (MPC), attitude control was demonstrated by adjusting the limbs and tether length to modulate the system's principal moments of inertia. Our results indicate that this control strategy allows the robot to stabilize during flight phases without needing traditional flywheel-based systems or relying on aerodynamics, making the approach mass-efficient and ideal for small-scale planetary robots' successive jumps. The paper outlines the dynamics, MPC formulation for inertial morphing, actuator requirements, and simulation results, illustrating the potential of agile exploration for small-scale rovers in low-gravity environments like the Moon or asteroids.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceeding to IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce a novel framework for learning world models that accurately capture complex, partially observable, and stochastic dynamics. The proposed method employs a dual-autoregressive mechanism and self-supervised training to achieve reliable long-horizon predictions without relying on domain-specific inductive biases, ensuring adaptability across diverse robotic tasks. We further propose a policy optimization framework that leverages world models for efficient training in imagined environments and seamless deployment in real-world systems. Through extensive experiments, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior autoregressive prediction accuracy, robustness to noise, and generalization across manipulation and locomotion tasks. Notably, policies trained with our method are successfully deployed on ANYmal D hardware in a zero-shot transfer, achieving robust performance with minimal sim-to-real performance loss. This work advances model-based reinforcement learning by addressing the challenges of long-horizon prediction, error accumulation, and sim-to-real transfer. By providing a scalable and robust framework, the introduced methods pave the way for adaptive and efficient robotic systems in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address the problem of planning in uncertain environments with a heterogeneous robot team of fast scout vehicles for information gathering and more risk-averse carrier robots from which the scouts vehicles are deployed. To overcome the computational challenges, we represent the environment and operational scenario using a topological graph, where the parameters of the edge weight distributions vary with the state of the robot team on the graph, and we formulate a computationally efficient mixed-integer program which removes the dependence on the number of robots from its decision space. Our formulation results in the capability to generate optimal multi-robot, long-horizon plans in seconds that could otherwise be computationally intractable. Ultimately our approach enables real-time re-planning, since the computation time is significantly faster than the time to execute one step. We evaluate our approach in a scenario where the robot team must traverse an environment while minimizing detection by observers in positions that are uncertain to the robot team. We demonstrate that our approach is computationally tractable, can improve performance in the presence of imperfect information, and can be adjusted for different risk profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

To enhance scene reconstruction efficiency and ensure robot safety, we propose the Risk-aware Environment Masking (RaEM) framework. RaEM leverages coherent risk measures to dynamically prioritize safety-critical regions of the unknown environment, guiding active view acquisition algorithms toward identifying the next-best-view (NBV). Integrated with FisherRF, which selects the NBV by maximizing expected information gain, our framework achieves a dual objective: improving robot safety and increasing efficiency in risk-aware 3D scene reconstruction and understanding. Extensive high-fidelity experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to establish a robust and safety-focused framework for active robot exploration and 3D scene understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual collective behaviors on spherical robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20539v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The implementation of collective motion, traditionally, disregard the limited sensing capabilities of an individual, to instead assuming an omniscient perception of the environment. This study implements a visual flocking model in a ``robot-in-the-loop'' approach to reproduce these behaviors with a flock composed of 10 independent spherical robots. The model achieves robotic collective motion by only using panoramic visual information of each robot, such as retinal position, optical size and optic flow of the neighboring robots. We introduce a virtual anchor to confine the collective robotic movements so to avoid wall interactions. For the first time, a simple visual robot-in-the-loop approach succeed in reproducing several collective motion phases, in particular, swarming, and milling. Another milestone achieved with by this model is bridging the gap between simulation and physical experiments by demonstrating nearly identical behaviors in both environments with the same visual model. To conclude, we show that our minimal visual collective motion model is sufficient to recreate most collective behaviors on a robot-in-the-loop system that is scalable, behaves as numerical simulations predict and is easily comparable to traditional models.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 16 figures, journal bioinspired and biomimetics</p></details> |
| **[Torque Responsive Metamaterials Enable High Payload Soft Robot Arms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09819v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots have struggled to support large forces and moments while also supporting their own weight against gravity. This limits their ability to reach certain configurations necessary for tasks such as inspection and pushing objects up. We have overcome this limitation by creating an electrically driven metamaterial soft arm using handed shearing auxetics (HSA) and bendable extendable torque resistant (BETR) shafts. These use the large force and torque capacity of HSAs and the nestable torque transmission of BETRs to create a strong soft arm. We found that the HSA arm was able to push 2.3 kg vertically and lift more than 600 g when positioned horizontally, supporting 0.33 Nm of torque at the base. The arm is able to move between waypoints while carrying the large payload and demonstrates consistent movement with path variance below 5 mm. The HSA arm's ability to perform active grasping with HSA grippers was also demonstrated, requiring 20 N of pull force to dislodge the object. Finally, we test the arm in a pipe inspection task. The arm is able to locate all the defects while sliding against the inner surface of the pipe, demonstrating its compliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, currently under review</p></details> |

For example, cutting the carrot requires adhering to a geometric constraint: the blade of the knife should be perpendicular to the carrot's direction. By interpreting these constraints through symbolic language representations and translating them into low-level actions, GeoManip bridges the gap between natural language and robotic execution, enabling greater generalizability across diverse even unseen tasks, objects, and scenarios. Unlike vision-language-action models that require extensive training, operates training-free by utilizing large foundational models: a constraint generation module that predicts stage-specific geometric constraints and a geometry parser that identifies object parts involved in these constraints. A solver then optimizes trajectories to satisfy inferred constraints from task descriptions and the scene. Furthermore, GeoManip learns in-context and provides five appealing human-robot interaction features: on-the-fly policy adaptation, learning from human demonstrations, learning from failure cases, long-horizon action planning, and efficient data collection for imitation learning. Extensive evaluations on both simulations and real-world scenarios demonstrate GeoManip's state-of-the-art performance, with superior out-of-distribution generalization while avoiding costly model training.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |

However, due to the complexity of deployment environments or the prevalence of ambiguous-condition objects, the practical application of robotics still faces many challenges, leading to frequent errors. Traditional methods and some LLM-based approaches, although improved, still require substantial human intervention and struggle with autonomous error correction in complex scenarios.In this work, we propose RoboReflect, a novel framework leveraging large vision-language models (LVLMs) to enable self-reflection and autonomous error correction in robotic grasping tasks. RoboReflect allows robots to automatically adjust their strategies based on unsuccessful attempts until successful execution is achieved.The corrected strategies are saved in a memory for future task reference.We evaluate RoboReflect through extensive testing on eight common objects prone to ambiguous conditions of three categories.Our results demonstrate that RoboReflect not only outperforms existing grasp pose estimation methods like AnyGrasp and high-level action planning techniques using GPT-4V but also significantly enhances the robot's ability to adapt and correct errors independently. These findings underscore the critical importance of autonomous selfreflection in robotic systems while effectively addressing the challenges posed by ambiguous environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interoceptive Robots for Convergent Shared Control in Collaborative Construction Work](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09290v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) with optimized efficiency and adaptive capabilities-able to respond to changing task demands and dynamic environments-is a strongly desired goal for advancing construction robotics. Such robots can play a critical role in enabling automation, reducing operational carbon footprints, and supporting modular construction processes. Inspired by the adaptive autonomy of living organisms, we introduce interoception, which centers on the robot's internal state representation, as a foundation for developing self-reflection and conscious learning to enable continual learning and adaptability in robotic agents. In this paper, we factorize internal state variables and mathematical properties as "cognitive dissonance" in shared control paradigms, where human interventions occasionally occur. We offer a new perspective on how interoception can help build adaptive motion planning in AMRs by integrating the legacy of heuristic costs from grid/graph-based algorithms with recent advances in neuroscience and reinforcement learning. Declarative and procedural knowledge extracted from human semantic inputs is encoded into a hypergraph model that overlaps with the spatial configuration of onsite layout for path planning. In addition, we design a velocity-replay module using an encoder-decoder architecture with few-shot learning to enable robots to replicate velocity profiles in contextualized scenarios for multi-robot synchronization and handover collaboration. These "cached" knowledge representations are demonstrated in simulated environments for multi-robot motion planning and stacking tasks. The insights from this study pave the way toward artificial general intelligence in AMRs, fostering their progression from complexity to competence in construction automation.</p></details> |  |

Both avenues have, however, shown their limitations; the former lacks structure and performs poorly outside training data, while the latter requires significant simplifications and extensive expert knowledge to be used in practice. This paper introduces a streamlined method for learning low-dimensional, physics-based models that are both accurate and easy to interpret. We start with an algorithm that uses image data (i.e., shape evolutions) to determine the minimal necessary segments for describing a soft robot's movement. Following this, we apply a dynamic regression and strain sparsification algorithm to identify relevant strains and define the model's dynamics. We validate our approach through simulations with various planar soft manipulators, comparing its performance against other learning strategies, showing that our models are both computationally efficient and 25x more accurate on out-of-training distribution inputs. Finally, we demonstrate that thanks to the capability of the method of generating physically compatible models, the learned models can be straightforwardly combined with model-based control policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, appearing in Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE 8th International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)</p></details> |

This paper investigates, for the first time, the application of general turn-taking models, specifically TurnGPT and Voice Activity Projection (VAP), to improve conversational dynamics in HRI. These models are trained on human-human dialogue data using self-supervised learning objectives, without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose methods for using these models in tandem to predict when a robot should begin preparing responses, take turns, and handle potential interruptions. We evaluated the proposed system in a within-subject study against a traditional baseline system, using the Furhat robot with 39 adults in a conversational setting, in combination with a large language model for autonomous response generation. The results show that participants significantly prefer the proposed system, and it significantly reduces response delays and interruptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at HRI 2025 (the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction)</p></details> |

However, most existing MIS robotic systems cannot facilitate direct measurement of the interaction force with hardware sensors due to space limitations. This letter introduces an effective vision-based scheme that utilizes a One-Shot structured light projection with a designed pattern on soft tissue coupled with haptic information processing through a trained image-to-force neural network. The images captured from the endoscopic stereo camera are analyzed to reconstruct high-resolution 3D point clouds for soft tissue deformation. Based on this, a modified PointNet-based force estimation method is proposed, which excels in representing the complex mechanical properties of soft tissue. Numerical force interaction experiments are conducted on three silicon materials with different stiffness. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Dynamic Situational Awareness in Human Robot Teams: An Interview Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08507v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In human-robot teams, human situational awareness is the operator's conscious knowledge of the team's states, actions, plans and their environment. Appropriate human situational awareness is critical to successful human-robot collaboration. In human-robot teaming, it is often assumed that the best and required level of situational awareness is knowing everything at all times. This view is problematic, because what a human needs to know for optimal team performance varies given the dynamic environmental conditions, task context and roles and capabilities of team members. We explore this topic by interviewing 16 participants with active and repeated experience in diverse human-robot teaming applications. Based on analysis of these interviews, we derive a framework explaining the dynamic nature of required situational awareness in human-robot teaming. In addition, we identify a range of factors affecting the dynamic nature of required and actual levels of situational awareness (i.e., dynamic situational awareness), types of situational awareness inefficiencies resulting from gaps between actual and required situational awareness, and their main consequences. We also reveal various strategies, initiated by humans and robots, that assist in maintaining the required situational awareness. Our findings inform the implementation of accurate estimates of dynamic situational awareness and the design of user-adaptive human-robot interfaces. Therefore, this work contributes to the future design of more collaborative and effective human-robot teams.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative and Asynchronous Transformer-based Mission Planning for Heterogeneous Teams of Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06372v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative mission planning for heterogeneous teams of mobile robots presents a unique set of challenges, particularly when operating under communication constraints and limited computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose the Cooperative and Asynchronous Transformer-based Mission Planning (CATMiP) framework, which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to coordinate distributed decision making among agents with diverse sensing, motion, and actuation capabilities, operating under sporadic ad hoc communication. A Class-based Macro-Action Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (CMacDec-POMDP) is also formulated to effectively model asynchronous decision-making for heterogeneous teams of agents. The framework utilizes an asynchronous centralized training and distributed execution scheme that is developed based on the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) architecture. This design allows a single trained model to generalize to larger environments and accommodate varying team sizes and compositions. We evaluate CATMiP in a 2D grid-world simulation environment and compare its performance against planning-based exploration methods. Results demonstrate CATMiP's superior efficiency, scalability, and robustness to communication dropouts, highlighting its potential for real-world heterogeneous mobile robot systems. The code is available at https://github.com/mylad13/CATMiP.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, this work has been submitted to Elsevier for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Sight: Finetuning Generalist Robot Policies with Heterogeneous Sensors via Language Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04693v3)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interacting with the world is a multi-sensory experience: achieving effective general-purpose interaction requires making use of all available modalities -- including vision, touch, and audio -- to fill in gaps from partial observation. For example, when vision is occluded reaching into a bag, a robot should rely on its senses of touch and sound. However, state-of-the-art generalist robot policies are typically trained on large datasets to predict robot actions solely from visual and proprioceptive observations. In this work, we propose FuSe, a novel approach that enables finetuning visuomotor generalist policies on heterogeneous sensor modalities for which large datasets are not readily available by leveraging natural language as a common cross-modal grounding. We combine a multimodal contrastive loss with a sensory-grounded language generation loss to encode high-level semantics. In the context of robot manipulation, we show that FuSe enables performing challenging tasks that require reasoning jointly over modalities such as vision, touch, and sound in a zero-shot setting, such as multimodal prompting, compositional cross-modal prompting, and descriptions of objects it interacts with. We show that the same recipe is applicable to widely different generalist policies, including both diffusion-based generalist policies and large vision-language-action (VLA) models. Extensive experiments in the real world show that FuSeis able to increase success rates by over 20% compared to all considered baselines.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional systems, which rely on a limited set of predefined gestures, GestLLM leverages large language models and feature extraction via MediaPipe to interpret a diverse range of gestures. This integration addresses key limitations in existing systems, such as restricted gesture flexibility and the inability to recognize complex or unconventional gestures commonly used in human communication. By combining state-of-the-art feature extraction and language model capabilities, GestLLM achieves performance comparable to leading vision-language models while supporting gestures underrepresented in traditional datasets. For example, this includes gestures from popular culture, such as the ``Vulcan salute" from Star Trek, without any additional pretraining, prompt engineering, etc. This flexibility enhances the naturalness and inclusivity of robot control, making interactions more intuitive and user-friendly. GestLLM provides a significant step forward in gesture-based interaction, enabling robots to understand and respond to a wide variety of hand gestures effectively. This paper outlines its design, implementation, and evaluation, demonstrating its potential applications in advanced human-robot collaboration, assistive robotics, and interactive entertainment.</p></details> |  |

We develop a data-driven strategy that accommodates the noise in sensed data and the limited energy capacity of the sensors, and generates collision-free motion plans for the team. We propose a bi-level approach, where a high-level planner leverages a multi-armed bandit framework to determine the potential regions of interest for the drones to visit next based on the data collected online. Then, a low-level path planner based on integer programming coordinates the paths for the team to visit the target regions subject to the physical constraints.

These tasks are difficult to model, making classical control challenging. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution by enabling the learning of models and control policies directly from data. However, its application to real-world problems is limited by data inefficiency and unsafe exploration. Adaptive hybrid RL methods blend classical control and RL adaptively, combining the strengths of both: structure from control and learning from RL. This has led to improvements in data efficiency and exploration safety. However, their potential for hardware applications remains underexplored, with no evaluations on physical systems to date. Such evaluations are critical to fully assess the practicality and effectiveness of these methods in real-world settings. This work presents an experimental demonstration of the hybrid RL algorithm CHEQ for robotic polishing with variable impedance, a task requiring precise force and velocity tracking. In simulation, we show that variable impedance enhances polishing performance. We compare standalone RL with adaptive hybrid RL, demonstrating that CHEQ achieves effective learning while adhering to safety constraints. On hardware, CHEQ achieves effective polishing behaviour, requiring only eight hours of training and incurring just five failures. These results highlight the potential of adaptive hybrid RL for real-world, contact-rich tasks trained directly on hardware.</p></details> |  |

Its successor, Industry 5.0, envisions humans as collaborators and experts guiding these AI-driven manufacturing solutions. Developing these techniques necessitates algorithms capable of safe, real-time identification of human positions in a scene, particularly their hands, during collaborative assembly.

Current research predominantly evaluates hand segmentation under in-distribution (ID) data, which reflects the training data of deep learning (DL) models. However, this approach fails to address out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios that often arise in real-world human-robot interactions. In this study, we present a novel approach by evaluating the performance of pre-trained DL models under both ID data and more challenging OOD scenarios. To mimic realistic industrial scenarios, we designed a diverse dataset featuring simple and cluttered backgrounds with industrial tools, varying numbers of hands (0 to 4), and hands with and without gloves. For OOD scenarios, we incorporated unique and rare conditions such as finger-crossing gestures and motion blur from fast-moving hands, addressing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. To ensure multiple point of views (PoVs), we utilized both egocentric cameras, mounted on the operator's head, and static cameras to capture RGB images of human-robot interactions. This approach allowed us to account for multiple camera perspectives while also evaluating the performance of models trained on existing egocentric datasets as well as static-camera datasets. For segmentation, we used a deep ensemble model composed of UNet and RefineNet as base learners. Performance evaluation was conducted using segmentation metrics and uncertainty quantification via predictive entropy. Results revealed that models trained on industrial datasets outperformed those trained on non-industrial datasets, highlighting the importance of context-specific training. Although all models struggled with OOD scenarios, those trained on industrial datasets demonstrated significantly better generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Synesthesia: A Sound and Emotion Guided AI Painter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04850v3)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>If a picture paints a thousand words, sound may voice a million. While recent robotic painting and image synthesis methods have achieved progress in generating visuals from text inputs, the translation of sound into images is vastly unexplored. Generally, sound-based interfaces and sonic interactions have the potential to expand accessibility and control for the user and provide a means to convey complex emotions and the dynamic aspects of the real world. In this paper, we propose an approach for using sound and speech to guide a robotic painting process, known here as robot synesthesia. For general sound, we encode the simulated paintings and input sounds into the same latent space. For speech, we decouple speech into its transcribed text and the tone of the speech. Whereas we use the text to control the content, we estimate the emotions from the tone to guide the mood of the painting. Our approach has been fully integrated with FRIDA, a robotic painting framework, adding sound and speech to FRIDA's existing input modalities, such as text and style. In two surveys, participants were able to correctly guess the emotion or natural sound used to generate a given painting more than twice as likely as random chance. On our sound-guided image manipulation and music-guided paintings, we discuss the results qualitatively.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Inductive Learning of Robot Task Knowledge from Raw Data and Online Expert Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07507v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing level of autonomy of robots poses challenges of trust and social acceptance, especially in human-robot interaction scenarios. This requires an interpretable implementation of robotic cognitive capabilities, possibly based on formal methods as logics for the definition of task specifications. However, prior knowledge is often unavailable in complex realistic scenarios. In this paper, we propose an offline algorithm based on inductive logic programming from noisy examples to extract task specifications (i.e., action preconditions, constraints and effects) directly from raw data of few heterogeneous (i.e., not repetitive) robotic executions. Our algorithm leverages on the output of any unsupervised action identification algorithm from video-kinematic recordings. Combining it with the definition of very basic, almost task-agnostic, commonsense concepts about the environment, which contribute to the interpretability of our methodology, we are able to learn logical axioms encoding preconditions of actions, as well as their effects in the event calculus paradigm. Since the quality of learned specifications depends mainly on the accuracy of the action identification algorithm, we also propose an online framework for incremental refinement of task knowledge from user feedback, guaranteeing safe execution. Results in a standard manipulation task and benchmark for user training in the safety-critical surgical robotic scenario, show the robustness, data- and time-efficiency of our methodology, with promising results towards the scalability in more complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Sense of Agency in Assistive Robotics Using Shared Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07462v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sense of agency is one factor that influences people's preferences for robot assistance and a phenomenon from cognitive science that represents the experience of control over one's environment. However, in assistive robotics literature, we often see paradigms that optimize measures like task success and cognitive load, rather than sense of agency. In fact, prior work has found that participants sometimes express a preference for paradigms, such as direct teleoperation, which do not perform well with those other metrics but give more control to the user. In this work, we focus on a subset of assistance paradigms for manipulation called shared autonomy in which the system combines control signals from the user and the automated control. We run a study to evaluate sense of agency and show that higher robot autonomy during assistance leads to improved task performance but a decreased sense of agency, indicating a potential trade-off between task performance and sense of agency. From our findings, we discuss the relation between sense of agency and optimality, and we consider a proxy metric for a component of sense of agency which might enable us to build systems that monitor and maintain sense of agency in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figure, HRI conference</p></details> |
