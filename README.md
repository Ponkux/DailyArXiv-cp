| **[MoMa-Kitchen: A 100K+ Benchmark for Affordance-Grounded Last-Mile Navigation in Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11081v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mobile manipulation, navigation and manipulation are often treated as separate problems, resulting in a significant gap between merely approaching an object and engaging with it effectively. Many navigation approaches primarily define success by proximity to the target, often overlooking the necessity for optimal positioning that facilitates subsequent manipulation. To address this, we introduce MoMa-Kitchen, a benchmark dataset comprising over 100k samples that provide training data for models to learn optimal final navigation positions for seamless transition to manipulation. Our dataset includes affordance-grounded floor labels collected from diverse kitchen environments, in which robotic mobile manipulators of different models attempt to grasp target objects amidst clutter. Using a fully automated pipeline, we simulate diverse real-world scenarios and generate affordance labels for optimal manipulation positions. Visual data are collected from RGB-D inputs captured by a first-person view camera mounted on the robotic arm, ensuring consistency in viewpoint during data collection. We also develop a lightweight baseline model, NavAff, for navigation affordance grounding that demonstrates promising performance on the MoMa-Kitchen benchmark. Our approach enables models to learn affordance-based final positioning that accommodates different arm types and platform heights, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable integration of navigation and manipulation in embodied AI.

| **[Making Every Frame Matter: Continuous Activity Recognition in Streaming Video via Adaptive Video Context Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14993v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video activity recognition has become increasingly important in robots and embodied AI. Recognizing continuous video activities poses considerable challenges due to the fast expansion of streaming video, which contains multi-scale and untrimmed activities. We introduce a novel system, CARS, to overcome these issues through adaptive video context modeling. Adaptive video context modeling refers to selectively maintaining activity-related features in temporal and spatial dimensions. CARS has two key designs. The first is an activity spatial feature extraction by eliminating irrelevant visual features while maintaining recognition accuracy. The second is an activity-aware state update introducing dynamic adaptability to better preserve the video context for multi-scale activity recognition. Our CARS runs at speeds $>$30 FPS on typical edge devices and outperforms all baselines by 1.2\% to 79.7\% in accuracy. Moreover, we explore applying CARS to a large video model as a video encoder. Experimental results show that our CARS can result in a 0.46-point enhancement (on a 5-point scale) on the in-distribution video activity dataset, and an improvement ranging from 1.19\% to 4\% on zero-shot video activity datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Long-horizon Embodied Planning with Implicit Logical Inference and Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15658v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon embodied planning underpins embodied AI. To accomplish long-horizon tasks, one of the most feasible ways is to decompose abstract instructions into a sequence of actionable steps. Foundation models still face logical errors and hallucinations in long-horizon planning, unless provided with highly relevant examples to the tasks. However, providing highly relevant examples for any random task is unpractical. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a novel framework for Real-time Long-horizon Embodied Planning. ReLEP can complete a wide range of long-horizon tasks without in-context examples by learning implicit logical inference through fine-tuning. The fine-tuned large vision-language model formulates plans as sequences of skill functions. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. When constructing the dataset, we considered the implicit logical relationships, enabling the model to learn implicit logical relationships and dispel hallucinations. Through comprehensive evaluations across various long-horizon tasks, ReLEP demonstrates high success rates and compliance to execution even on unseen tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[AhaRobot: A Low-Cost Open-Source Bimanual Mobile Manipulator for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10070v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation and manipulation in open-world environments remain unsolved challenges in the Embodied AI. The high cost of commercial mobile manipulation robots significantly limits research in real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose AhaRobot, a low-cost and fully open-source dual-arm mobile manipulation robot system with a hardware cost of only $1,000 (excluding optional computational resources), which is less than 1/15 of the cost of popular mobile robots. The AhaRobot system consists of three components: (1) a novel low-cost hardware architecture primarily composed of off-the-shelf components, (2) an optimized control solution to enhance operational precision integrating dual-motor backlash control and static friction compensation, and (3) a simple remote teleoperation method RoboPilot. We use handles to control the dual arms and pedals for whole-body movement. The teleoperation process is low-burden and easy to operate, much like piloting. RoboPilot is designed for remote data collection in embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboPilot significantly enhances data collection efficiency in complex manipulation tasks, achieving a 30% increase compared to methods using 3D mouse and leader-follower systems. It also excels at completing extremely long-horizon tasks in one go. Furthermore, AhaRobot can be used to learn end-to-end policies and autonomously perform complex manipulation tasks, such as pen insertion and cleaning up the floor. We aim to build an affordable yet powerful platform to promote the development of embodied tasks on real devices, advancing more robust and reliable embodied AI.

| **[Reasoning in visual navigation of end-to-end trained agents: a dynamical systems approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08306v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Progress in Embodied AI has made it possible for end-to-end-trained agents to navigate in photo-realistic environments with high-level reasoning and zero-shot or language-conditioned behavior, but benchmarks are still dominated by simulation. In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control. An interactive tool is available at europe.naverlabs.com/research/publications/reasoning-in-visual-navigation-of-end-to-end-trained-agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmBARDiment: an Embodied AI Agent for Productivity in XR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08158v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>XR devices running chat-bots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have the to become always-on agents that enable much better productivity scenarios. Current screen based chat-bots do not take advantage of the the full-suite of natural inputs available in XR, including inward facing sensor data, instead they over-rely on explicit voice or text prompts, sometimes paired with multi-modal data dropped as part of the query. We propose a solution that leverages an attention framework that derives context implicitly from user actions, eye-gaze, and contextual memory within the XR environment. Our work minimizes the need for engineered explicit prompts, fostering grounded and intuitive interactions that glean user insights for the chat-bot.</p></details> |  |
| **[HO-Cap: A Capture System and Dataset for 3D Reconstruction and Pose Tracking of Hand-Object Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06843v4)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a data capture system and a new dataset, HO-Cap, for 3D reconstruction and pose tracking of hands and objects in videos. The system leverages multiple RGBD cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Effectiveness of a Socratic Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning Method for Task Planning in Robotics, A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08174v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in reasoning with natural language. Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks. To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenFly: A Versatile Toolchain and Large-scale Benchmark for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents through an environment by leveraging both language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Dynamic Hand-Object Interactions with Applications to Human-Robot Handovers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04879v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans frequently grasp, manipulate, and move objects. Interactive systems assist humans in these tasks, enabling applications in Embodied AI, human-robot interaction, and virtual reality. However, current methods in hand-object synthesis often neglect dynamics and focus on generating static grasps. The first part of this dissertation introduces dynamic grasp synthesis, where a hand grasps and moves an object to a target pose. We approach this task using physical simulation and reinforcement learning. We then extend this to bimanual manipulation and articulated objects, requiring fine-grained coordination between hands. In the second part of this dissertation, we study human-to-robot handovers. We integrate captured human motion into simulation and introduce a student-teacher framework that adapts to human behavior and transfers from sim to real. To overcome data scarcity, we generate synthetic interactions, increasing training diversity by 100x. Our user study finds no difference between policies trained on synthetic vs. real motions.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |
| **[SonicSim: A customizable simulation platform for speech processing in moving sound source scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01481v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systematic evaluation of speech separation and enhancement models under moving sound source conditions requires extensive and diverse data. However, real-world datasets often lack sufficient data for training and evaluation, and synthetic datasets, while larger, lack acoustic realism. Consequently, neither effectively meets practical needs. To address this issue, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit based on the embodied AI simulation platform Habitat-sim, designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim supports multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level adjustments, enabling the creation of more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a benchmark dataset called SonicSet, utilizing LibriSpeech, Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K), Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to investigate the differences between synthetic and real-world data, we selected 5 hours of raw, non-reverberant data from the SonicSet validation set and recorded a real-world speech separation dataset, providing a reference for comparing SonicSet with other synthetic datasets. For speech enhancement, we utilized the real-world dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between SonicSet and existing synthetic datasets. The results indicate that models trained on SonicSet generalize better to real-world scenarios compared to other synthetic datasets. The code is publicly available at https://cslikai.cn/SonicSim/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14093v4)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI is widely recognized as a key element of artificial general intelligence because it involves controlling embodied agents to perform tasks in the physical world. Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |
| **[WMNav: Integrating Vision-Language Models into World Models for Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02247v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Goal Navigation-requiring an agent to locate a specific object in an unseen environment-remains a core challenge in embodied AI. Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

| **[From Screens to Scenes: A Survey of Embodied AI in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07468v3)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare systems worldwide face persistent challenges in efficiency, accessibility, and personalization. Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 11 figures, manuscript accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |
| **[AffordGrasp: In-Context Affordance Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary Task-Oriented Grasping in Clutter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00778v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring the affordance of an object and grasping it in a task-oriented manner is crucial for robots to successfully complete manipulation tasks. Affordance indicates where and how to grasp an object by taking its functionality into account, serving as the foundation for effective task-oriented grasping. However, current task-oriented methods often depend on extensive training data that is confined to specific tasks and objects, making it difficult to generalize to novel objects and complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce AffordGrasp, a novel open-vocabulary grasping framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) for in-context affordance reasoning. Unlike existing methods that rely on explicit task and object specifications, our approach infers tasks directly from implicit user instructions, enabling more intuitive and seamless human-robot interaction in everyday scenarios. Building on the reasoning outcomes, our framework identifies task-relevant objects and grounds their part-level affordances using a visual grounding module. This allows us to generate task-oriented grasp poses precisely within the affordance regions of the object, ensuring both functional and context-aware robotic manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. We believe our approach advances robotic manipulation techniques and contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://eqcy.github.io/affordgrasp/.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

| **[3D-Mem: 3D Scene Memory for Embodied Exploration and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17735v4)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing compact and informative 3D scene representations is essential for effective embodied exploration and reasoning, especially in complex environments over extended periods. Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[ManiSkill-HAB: A Benchmark for Low-Level Manipulation in Home Rearrangement Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13211v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality benchmarks are the foundation for embodied AI research, enabling significant advancements in long-horizon navigation, manipulation and rearrangement tasks. However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of prior magical grasp implementations at a fraction of the GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping Language-Guided Navigation Learning with Self-Refining Data Flywheel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08467v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating high-quality data for training robust language-instructed agents is a long-lasting challenge in embodied AI. In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |
| **[Towards Robust and Secure Embodied AI: A Survey on Vulnerabilities and Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13175v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, including robots and autonomous vehicles, are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, where they encounter a range of vulnerabilities stemming from both environmental and system-level factors. These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Pattern Recognition Letters.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, when powered by open LLMs, they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a multicomponent memory system. In Minecraft experiments, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks where traditional Voyager fails without GPT-4, collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items and achieving $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones, advancing from basic wood tools to advanced iron equipment. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated collaborative experiences. MindForge advances the democratization of embodied AI development through open-ended social learning, enabling peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.</p></details> |  |

Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |

Recent advances in foundation models pave the way for generative agents capable of richer communication and adaptive problem-solving. This survey provides a systematic examination of how EMAS can benefit from these generative capabilities. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes EMAS by system architectures and embodiment modalities, emphasizing how collaboration spans both physical and virtual contexts. Central building blocks, perception, planning, communication, and feedback, are then analyzed to illustrate how generative techniques bolster system robustness and flexibility. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the transformative effects of integrating foundation models into embodied, multi-agent frameworks. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions, underlining the significant promise of EMAS to reshape the landscape of AI-driven collaboration.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We propose a novel object-centric latent action learning approach, based on VideoSaur and LAPO, that employs self-supervised decomposition of scenes into object representations and annotates video data with proxy-action labels. This method effectively disentangles causal agent-object interactions from irrelevant background noise and reduces the performance degradation of latent action learning approaches caused by distractors. Our preliminary experiments with the Distracting Control Suite show that latent action pretraining based on object decompositions improve the quality of inferred latent actions by x2.7 and efficiency of downstream fine-tuning with a small set of labeled actions, increasing return by x2.6 on average.</p></details> | Preprint.

| **[POEX: Understanding and Mitigating Policy Executable Jailbreak Attacks against Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16633v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems are rapidly evolving due to the integration of LLMs as planning modules, which transform complex instructions into executable policies. However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

These advancements have led to an explosive increase in the demand for computational power, challenging the limits of Moore's Law. Optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing, faces significant challenges due to its high costs. To address this, various lithography simulators have been developed. However, many of these simulators are limited by their inadequate photoresist modeling capabilities. This paper presents TorchResist, an open-source, differentiable photoresist simulator.TorchResist employs an analytical approach to model the photoresist process, functioning as a white-box system with at most twenty interpretable parameters. Leveraging modern differentiable programming techniques and parallel computing on GPUs, TorchResist enables seamless co-optimization with other tools across multiple related tasks.

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |

Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code will be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</p></details> |  |

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | Preprint.

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |

This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA.

Nevertheless, the rapid development of MEANETs is accompanied by challenges in trustworthiness and operational efficiency. Fortunately, blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable characteristics, offers promising solutions for MEANETs. However, existing block propagation mechanisms suffer from challenges such as low propagation efficiency and weak security for block propagation, which results in delayed transmission of vehicular messages or vulnerability to malicious tampering, potentially causing severe traffic accidents in blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Moreover, current block propagation strategies cannot effectively adapt to real-time changes of dynamic topology in MEANETs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph Resfusion model-based trustworthy block propagation optimization framework for consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Specifically, we propose an innovative trust calculation mechanism based on the trust cloud model, which comprehensively accounts for randomness and fuzziness in the miner trust evaluation. Furthermore, by leveraging the strengths of graph neural networks and diffusion models, we develop a graph Resfusion model to effectively and adaptively generate the optimal block propagation trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other routing mechanisms in terms of block propagation efficiency and trustworthiness. Additionally, the results highlight its strong adaptability to dynamic environments, making it particularly suitable for rapidly changing MEANETs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development.

In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices.

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

MetaVQA leverages Set-of-Mark prompting and top-down view ground-truth annotations from nuScenes and Waymo datasets to automatically generate extensive question-answer pairs based on diverse real-world traffic scenarios, ensuring object-centric and context-rich instructions. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with the MetaVQA dataset significantly improves their spatial reasoning and embodied scene comprehension in safety-critical simulations, evident not only in improved VQA accuracies but also in emerging safety-aware driving maneuvers. In addition, the learning demonstrates strong transferability from simulation to real-world observation.

However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks. This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context. Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior studies that explored this as long-form video understanding and utilized egocentric video only, we instead propose an LLM-based agent, Embodied VideoAgent, which constructs scene memory from both egocentric video and embodied sensory inputs (e.g. depth and pose sensing). We further introduce a VLM-based approach to automatically update the memory when actions or activities over objects are perceived. Embodied VideoAgent attains significant advantages over counterparts in challenging reasoning and planning tasks in 3D scenes, achieving gains of 4.9% on Ego4D-VQ3D, 5.8% on OpenEQA, and 11.7% on EnvQA. We have also demonstrated its potential in various embodied AI tasks including generating embodied interactions and perception for robot manipulation.

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |

The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment.

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV. Finally, we discuss several future research directions for advancing EAI-enabled LAE.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</p></details> |  |

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/</p></details> |

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |

However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This study finds that state-of-the-art embodied AI agents compete for higher navigation quality, but often compromise the computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce "Skip-SCAR," an optimization framework that builds computationally and memory-efficient embodied AI agents to accomplish high-quality visual navigation tasks. Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint. Tested on the HM3D ObjectNav datasets and real-world physical hardware systems, Skip-SCAR not only minimizes hardware resources but also sets new performance benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of optimizing both navigation quality and computational efficiency for robotics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Privacy Risks in Reinforcement Learning for Household Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09273v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prominence of embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI), which empowers robots to navigate, perceive, and engage within virtual environments, has attracted significant attention, owing to the remarkable advances in computer vision and large language models. Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functionality understanding and segmentation in 3D scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16310v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

Despite recent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods often lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in scenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this paper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and scalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors and multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion (OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved surfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric fidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital twins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM-based planners are inefficient due to their large number of parameters and prone to inaccuracies because they operate in open-loop systems. We think the reason is that only applying LLMs as planners is insufficient. In this work, we propose DaDu-E, a robust closed-loop planning framework for embodied AI robots. Specifically, DaDu-E is equipped with a relatively lightweight LLM, a set of encapsulated robot skill instructions, a robust feedback system, and memory augmentation. Together, these components enable DaDu-E to (i) actively perceive and adapt to dynamic environments, (ii) optimize computational costs while maintaining high performance, and (iii) recover from execution failures using its memory and feedback mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world and simulated tasks show that DaDu-E achieves task success rates comparable to embodied AI robots with larger models as planners like COME-Robot, while reducing computational requirements by $6.6 \times$.

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters, connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and easy integration with downstream tasks. We provide open access to our dataset, benchmark, and method's source code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Reward and Policy Jointly from Demonstration and Preference Improves Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06874v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for building contemporary foundation models and embodied AI. However, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning task. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant under-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward model and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment performance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated Human Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and demonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach admits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and leverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy Optimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment pipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with extensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially when the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[EARBench: Towards Evaluating Physical Risk Awareness for Task Planning of Foundation Model-based Embodied AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04449v5)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) integrates advanced AI models into physical entities for real-world interaction. The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EARBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EARDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downstream tasks. Image-to-video diffusion models are already capable of generating highly realistic synthetic videos. However, these models are not action-conditioned, and the most powerful models are closed-source which means they cannot be finetuned. In this work, we propose to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to action-conditioned world models, without access to the parameters of the pretrained model. Our approach, AVID, trains an adapter on a small domain-specific dataset of action-labelled videos. AVID uses a learned mask to modify the intermediate outputs of the pretrained model and generate accurate action-conditioned videos. We evaluate AVID on video game and real-world robotics data, and show that it outperforms existing baselines for diffusion model adaptation.1 Our results demonstrate that if utilized correctly, pretrained video models have the potential to be powerful tools for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/avid-world-model-adapters/home</p></details> |

In this study, we introduce ROOT, a VLM-based system designed to enhance the analysis of indoor scenes. Specifically, we first develop an iterative object perception algorithm using GPT-4V to detect object entities within indoor scenes. This is followed by employing vision foundation models to acquire additional meta-information about the scene, such as bounding boxes. Building on this foundational data, we propose a specialized VLM, SceneVLM, which is capable of generating spatial hierarchical scene graphs and providing distance information for objects within indoor environments. This information enhances our understanding of the spatial arrangement of indoor scenes. To train our SceneVLM, we collect over 610,000 images from various public indoor datasets and implement a scene data generation pipeline with a semi-automated technique to establish relationships and estimate distances among indoor objects. By utilizing this enriched data, we conduct various training recipes and finish SceneVLM. Our experiments demonstrate that \rootname facilitates indoor scene understanding and proves effective in diverse downstream applications, such as 3D scene generation and embodied AI. The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/harrytea/ROOT}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs and 3D segmentation masks. In addition, we design MORE3D, a simple yet effective method that enables multi-object 3D reasoning segmentation with user questions and textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative World Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

| **[Software-Hardware Co-Design For Embodied AI Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04292v4)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI robots have the potential to fundamentally improve the way human beings live and manufacture. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame-basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes Corki, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI robot control. Our idea is to decouple LLM inference, robotic control and data communication in the embodied AI robots compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, Corki predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. Corki largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to 8.0x, resulting in up to 3.6x speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 17.3%. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/hyy0613/Corki</p></details> |  |

Generated models frequently fail to maintain balance when placed in physics-based simulations or 3D printed. This balance is crucial for satisfying user design intentions in interactive gaming, embodied AI, and robotics, where stable models are needed for reliable interaction. Additionally, stable models ensure that 3D-printed objects, such as figurines for home decoration, can stand on their own without requiring additional supports. To fill this gap, we introduce Atlas3D, an automatic and easy-to-implement method that enhances existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D tools. Atlas3D ensures the generation of self-supporting 3D models that adhere to physical laws of stability under gravity, contact, and friction. Our approach combines a novel differentiable simulation-based loss function with physically inspired regularization, serving as either a refinement or a post-processing module for existing frameworks. We verify Atlas3D's efficacy through extensive generation tasks and validate the resulting 3D models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunuoch.github.io/Atlas3D/</p></details> |

Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing Architect, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene. This iterative structure brings the flexibility for our method to generate or refine scenes from various starting points, such as text, floor plans, or pre-arranged environments.</p></details> |  |

Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, \textit{i.e.}, pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the strategy of representation. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multi-faceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multi-modal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: \url{https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey}.</p></details> |  |

Scene Retrieval with Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14565v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interfaces to embodied AI are becoming more ubiquitous in our daily lives. This opens up further opportunities for language-based interaction with embodied agents, such as a user verbally instructing an agent to execute some task in a specific location. For example, "put the bowls back in the cupboard next to the fridge" or "meet me at the intersection under the red sign." As such, we need methods that interface between natural language and map representations of the environment. To this end, we explore the question of whether we can use an open-set natural language query to identify a scene represented by a 3D scene graph. We define this task as "language-based scene-retrieval" and it is closely related to "coarse-localization," but we are instead searching for a match from a collection of disjoint scenes and not necessarily a large-scale continuous map. We present Text2SceneGraphMatcher, a "scene-retrieval" pipeline that learns joint embeddings between text descriptions and scene graphs to determine if they are a match. The code, trained models, and datasets will be made public.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios.

To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities. One may also in-place swap modules to improve the robustness of the overall platform, for instance with imitation-learned policies.

At present, many evaluation platforms with rich scenes, high visual fidelity and various application scenarios have been developed. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework named NeuronsGym that can be used for policy learning of robot tasks, covering a simulation platform for training policy, and a physical system for studying sim2real problems. Unlike most current single-task, slow-moving robotic platforms, our framework provides agile physical robots with a wider range of speeds, and can be employed to train robotic navigation and confrontation policies. At the same time, in order to evaluate the safety of robot navigation, we propose a safety-weighted path length (SFPL) to improve the safety evaluation in the current mobile robot navigation. Based on this platform, we build a new benchmark for navigation and confrontation tasks under this platform by comparing the current mainstream sim2real methods, and hold the 2022 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) RoboMaster sim2real challenge. We release the codes of this framework\footnote{\url{https://github.com/DRL-CASIA/NeuronsGym}} and hope that this platform can promote the development of more flexible and agile general mobile agent algorithms.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[EnvBridge: Bridging Diverse Environments with Cross-Environment Knowledge Transfer for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16919v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated high reasoning capabilities, drawing attention for their applications as agents in various decision-making processes. One notably promising application of LLM agents is robotic manipulation. Recent research has shown that LLMs can generate text planning or control code for robots, providing substantial flexibility and interaction capabilities. However, these methods still face challenges in terms of flexibility and applicability across different environments, limiting their ability to adapt autonomously. Current approaches typically fall into two categories: those relying on environment-specific policy training, which restricts their transferability, and those generating code actions based on fixed prompts, which leads to diminished performance when confronted with new environments. These limitations significantly constrain the generalizability of agents in robotic manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called EnvBridge. This approach involves the retention and transfer of successful robot control codes from source environments to target environments. EnvBridge enhances the agent's adaptability and performance across diverse settings by leveraging insights from multiple environments. Notably, our approach alleviates environmental constraints, offering a more flexible and generalizable solution for robotic manipulation tasks. We validated the effectiveness of our method using robotic manipulation benchmarks: RLBench, MetaWorld, and CALVIN. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully leverage diverse knowledge sources to solve complex tasks. Consequently, our approach significantly enhances the adaptability and robustness of robotic manipulation agents in planning across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

When integrated into an embodied agent, existing embodied VLM works either output detailed action sequences at the manipulation level or only provide plans at an abstract level, leaving a gap between high-level planning and real-world manipulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octopus, an embodied vision-language programmer that uses executable code generation as a medium to connect planning and manipulation. Octopus is designed to 1) proficiently comprehend an agent's visual and textual task objectives, 2) formulate intricate action sequences, and 3) generate executable code. To facilitate Octopus model development, we introduce OctoVerse: a suite of environments tailored for benchmarking vision-based code generators on a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games such as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Minecraft. To train Octopus, we leverage GPT-4 to control an explorative agent that generates training data, i.e., action blueprints and corresponding executable code. We also collect feedback that enables an enhanced training scheme called Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate Octopus's functionality and present compelling results, showing that the proposed RLEF refines the agent's decision-making. By open-sourcing our simulation environments, dataset, and model architecture, we aspire to ignite further innovation and foster collaborative applications within the broader embodied AI community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://choiszt.github.io/Octopus/, Codebase: https://github.com/dongyh20/Octopus</p></details> |

More recently, multi-agent systems with LLM-based agents (Multi-LLM) have been utilized increasingly more for QA. In these scenarios, the models may each answer the question and reach a consensus or each model is specialized to answer different domain questions. However, most prior work dealing with Multi-LLM QA has focused on scenarios where the models are asked in a zero-shot manner or are given information sources to extract the answer. For question answering of an unknown environment, embodied exploration of the environment is first needed to answer the question. This skill is necessary for personalizing embodied AI to environments such as households. There is a lack of insight into whether a Multi-LLM system can handle question-answering based on observations from embodied exploration. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the use of Multi-Embodied LLM Explorers (MELE) for QA in an unknown environment. Multiple LLM-based agents independently explore and then answer queries about a household environment. We analyze different aggregation methods to generate a single, final answer for each query: debating, majority voting, and training a central answer module (CAM). Using CAM, we observe a $46\%$ higher accuracy compared against the other non-learning-based aggregation methods. We provide code and the query dataset for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Through this unified latent action space, IGOR enables knowledge transfer among large-scale robot and human activity data. We achieve this by compressing visual changes between an initial image and its goal state into latent actions. IGOR allows us to generate latent action labels for internet-scale video data. This unified latent action space enables the training of foundation policy and world models across a wide variety of tasks performed by both robots and humans. We demonstrate that: (1) IGOR learns a semantically consistent action space for both human and robots, characterizing various possible motions of objects representing the physical interaction knowledge; (2) IGOR can "migrate" the movements of the object in the one video to other videos, even across human and robots, by jointly using the latent action model and world model; (3) IGOR can learn to align latent actions with natural language through the foundation policy model, and integrate latent actions with a low-level policy model to achieve effective robot control. We believe IGOR opens new possibilities for human-to-robot knowledge transfer and control.</p></details> |  |

Majority of prior arts adhere to an open-loop philosophy and lack real-time feedback, leading to error accumulation and undesirable robustness. A handful of approaches have endeavored to establish feedback mechanisms leveraging pixel-level differences or pre-trained visual representations, yet their efficacy and adaptability have been found to be constrained. Inspired by classic closed-loop control systems, we propose CLOVER, a closed-loop visuomotor control framework that incorporates feedback mechanisms to improve adaptive robotic control. CLOVER consists of a text-conditioned video diffusion model for generating visual plans as reference inputs, a measurable embedding space for accurate error quantification, and a feedback-driven controller that refines actions from feedback and initiates replans as needed. Our framework exhibits notable advancement in real-world robotic tasks and achieves state-of-the-art on CALVIN benchmark, improving by 8% over previous open-loop counterparts.

| **[Model-Agnostic Knowledge Guided Correction for Improved Neural Surrogate Rollout](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10048v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the evolution of physical systems is critical to many applications in science and engineering. As the evolution of these systems is governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), there are a number of computational simulations which resolve these systems with high accuracy. However, as these simulations incur high computational costs, they are infeasible to be employed for large-scale analysis. A popular alternative to simulators are neural network surrogates which are trained in a data-driven manner and are much more computationally efficient. However, these surrogate models suffer from high rollout error when used autoregressively, especially when confronted with training data paucity. Existing work proposes to improve surrogate rollout error by either including physical loss terms directly in the optimization of the model or incorporating computational simulators as `differentiable layers' in the neural network. Both of these approaches have their challenges, with physical loss functions suffering from slow convergence for stiff PDEs and simulator layers requiring gradients which are not always available, especially in legacy simulators. We propose the Hybrid PDE Predictor with Reinforcement Learning (HyPER) model: a model-agnostic, RL based, cost-aware model which combines a neural surrogate, RL decision model, and a physics simulator (with or without gradients) to reduce surrogate rollout error significantly. In addition to reducing in-distribution rollout error by 47%-78%, HyPER learns an intelligent policy that is adaptable to changing physical conditions and resistant to noise corruption.

Most theoretical results assume that it is possible to obtain unbiased gradient estimators, which is not the case in several recent deep learning and reinforcement learning applications that use Monte Carlo methods. This paper provides a comprehensive non-asymptotic analysis of SGD with biased gradients and adaptive steps for non-convex smooth functions. Our study incorporates time-dependent bias and emphasizes the importance of controlling the bias of the gradient estimator. In particular, we establish that Adagrad, RMSProp, and AMSGRAD, an exponential moving average variant of Adam, with biased gradients, converge to critical points for smooth non-convex functions at a rate similar to existing results in the literature for the unbiased case. Finally, we provide experimental results using Variational Autoenconders (VAE) and applications to several learning frameworks that illustrate our convergence results and show how the effect of bias can be reduced by appropriate hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> |  |

The design mimics human physiology, with symmetrical body alignment in the frontal plane to maintain static balance with straight knees. We develop a reinforcement learning policy that can be deployed zero-shot on the hardware for velocity-tracking walking tasks. Additionally, to enhance energy efficiency in locomotion, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning algorithm that encourages the robot to leverage passive dynamics. Our experimental results show that our passive policy reduces the cost of transport by up to $50\%$ in simulation and $31\%$ in real-world tests.

We show in this paper that GRPO with verifiable rewards can be written as a Kullback Leibler ($\mathsf{KL}$) regularized contrastive loss, where the contrastive samples are synthetic data sampled from the old policy. The optimal GRPO policy $\pi_{n}$ can be expressed explicitly in terms of the binary reward, as well as the first and second order statistics of the old policy ($\pi_{n-1}$) and the reference policy $\pi_0$. Iterating this scheme, we obtain a sequence of policies $\pi_{n}$ for which we can quantify the probability of success $p_n$. We show that the probability of success of the policy satisfies a recurrence that converges to a fixed point of a function that depends on the initial probability of success $p_0$ and the regularization parameter $\beta$ of the $\mathsf{KL}$ regularizer. We show that the fixed point $p^*$ is guaranteed to be larger than $p_0$, thereby demonstrating that GRPO effectively amplifies the probability of success of the policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unicorn: A Universal and Collaborative Reinforcement Learning Approach Towards Generalizable Network-Wide Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11488v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) is crucial in reducing congestion, maximizing throughput, and improving mobility in rapidly growing urban areas. Recent advancements in parameter-sharing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have greatly enhanced the scalable and adaptive optimization of complex, dynamic flows in large-scale homogeneous networks. However, the inherent heterogeneity of real-world traffic networks, with their varied intersection topologies and interaction dynamics, poses substantial challenges to achieving scalable and effective ATSC across different traffic scenarios. To address these challenges, we present Unicorn, a universal and collaborative MARL framework designed for efficient and adaptable network-wide ATSC. Specifically, we first propose a unified approach to map the states and actions of intersections with varying topologies into a common structure based on traffic movements. Next, we design a Universal Traffic Representation (UTR) module with a decoder-only network for general feature extraction, enhancing the model's adaptability to diverse traffic scenarios. Additionally, we incorporate an Intersection Specifics Representation (ISR) module, designed to identify key latent vectors that represent the unique intersection's topology and traffic dynamics through variational inference techniques. To further refine these latent representations, we employ a contrastive learning approach in a self-supervised manner, which enables better differentiation of intersection-specific features. Moreover, we integrate the state-action dependencies of neighboring agents into policy optimization, which effectively captures dynamic agent interactions and facilitates efficient regional collaboration. Our results show that Unicorn outperforms other methods across various evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential in complex, dynamic traffic networks.</p></details> |  |

Understanding the key innovative techniques behind DeepSeek's success is crucial for advancing LLM research. In this paper, we review the core techniques driving the remarkable effectiveness and efficiency of these models, including refinements to the transformer architecture, innovations such as Multi-Head Latent Attention and Mixture of Experts, Multi-Token Prediction, the co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware, the Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, post-training with pure reinforcement learning and iterative training alternating between supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Existing methods dynamically adjust the temperature to enable the student network to adapt to the varying learning difficulties at different learning stages of KD. KD is a continuous process, but when adjusting the temperature, these methods consider only the immediate benefits of the operation in the current learning phase and fail to take into account its future returns. To address this issue, we formulate the adjustment of temperature as a sequential decision-making task and propose a method based on reinforcement learning, termed RLKD. Importantly, we design a novel state representation to enable the agent to make more informed action (i.e. instance temperature adjustment). To handle the problem of delayed rewards in our method due to the KD setting, we explore an instance reward calibration approach. In addition,we devise an efficient exploration strategy that enables the agent to learn valuable instance temperature adjustment policy more efficiently. Our framework can serve as a plug-and-play technique to be inserted into various KD methods easily, and we validate its effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks.

However, designing control algorithms which can robustly navigate unseen environments with obstacles remains an ongoing problem within quadruped locomotion. To tackle this, it is convenient to solve navigation tasks by means of a hierarchical approach with a low-level locomotion policy and a high-level navigation policy. Crucially, the high-level policy needs to be robust to dynamic obstacles along the path of the agent. In this work, we propose a novel way to endow navigation policies with robustness by a training process that models obstacles as adversarial agents, following the adversarial RL paradigm. Importantly, to improve the reliability of the training process, we bound the rationality of the adversarial agent resorting to quantal response equilibria, and place a curriculum over its rationality. We called this method Hierarchical policies via Quantal response Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (Hi-QARL). We demonstrate the robustness of our method by benchmarking it in unseen randomized mazes with multiple obstacles. To prove its applicability in real scenarios, our method is applied on a Unitree GO1 robot in simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing 6G Dense Network Deployment for the Metaverse Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11449v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the Metaverse envisions deeply immersive and pervasive connectivity in 6G networks, Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) emerges as a critical enabler to meet the demanding requirements of massive and immersive communications. IAB networks offer a scalable solution for expanding broadband coverage in urban environments. However, optimizing IAB node deployment to ensure reliable coverage while minimizing costs remains challenging due to location constraints and the dynamic nature of cities. Existing heuristic methods, such as Greedy Algorithms, have been employed to address these optimization problems. This work presents a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning ( DRL) approach for IAB network planning, tailored to future 6G scenarios that seek to support ultra-high data rates and dense device connectivity required by immersive Metaverse applications. We utilize Deep Q-Network (DQN) with action elimination and integrate DQN, Double Deep Q-Network ( DDQN), and Dueling DQN architectures to effectively manage large state and action spaces. Simulations with various initial donor configurations demonstrate the effectiveness of our DRL approach, with Dueling DQN reducing node count by an average of 12.3% compared to traditional heuristics. The study underscores how advanced DRL techniques can address complex network planning challenges in 6G-enabled Metaverse contexts, providing an efficient and adaptive solution for IAB deployment in diverse urban environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diverse Projection Ensembles for Distributional Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07124v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contrast to classical reinforcement learning (RL), distributional RL algorithms aim to learn the distribution of returns rather than their expected value. Since the nature of the return distribution is generally unknown a priori or arbitrarily complex, a common approach finds approximations within a set of representable, parametric distributions. Typically, this involves a projection of the unconstrained distribution onto the set of simplified distributions. We argue that this projection step entails a strong inductive bias when coupled with neural networks and gradient descent, thereby profoundly impacting the generalization behavior of learned models. In order to facilitate reliable uncertainty estimation through diversity, we study the combination of several different projections and representations in a distributional ensemble. We establish theoretical properties of such projection ensembles and derive an algorithm that uses ensemble disagreement, measured by the average 1-Wasserstein distance, as a bonus for deep exploration. We evaluate our algorithm on the behavior suite benchmark and VizDoom and find that diverse projection ensembles lead to significant performance improvements over existing methods on a variety of tasks with the most pronounced gains in directed exploration problems.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |

Despite the potential benefit of using wearable robots to treat spasticity, their use is not currently recommended to subjects with a level of spasticity above ${1^+}$ on the Modified Ashworth Scale. The varying dynamics of this velocity-dependent tonic stretch reflex make it difficult to deploy safe personalized controllers. Here, we describe a novel adaptive torque controller via deep reinforcement learning (RL) for a knee exoskeleton under joint spasticity conditions, which accounts for task performance and interaction forces reduction. To train the RL agent, we developed a digital twin, including a musculoskeletal-exoskeleton system with joint misalignment and a differentiable spastic reflexes model for the muscles activation. Results for a simulated knee extension movement showed that the agent learns to control the exoskeleton for individuals with different levels of spasticity. The proposed controller was able to reduce maximum torques applied to the human joint under spastic conditions by an average of 10.6\% and decreases the root mean square until the settling time by 8.9\% compared to a conventional compliant controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE 19th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR2025)</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning-Based Controlled Switching Approach for Inrush Current Minimization in Power Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11398v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are essential components for the reliable operation of power grids. The transformer core is constituted by a ferromagnetic material, and accordingly, depending on the magnetization state, the energization of the transformer can lead to high magnetizing inrush currents. Such high amplitudes shorten the life expectancy of a transformer and cause power quality issues in power grids. Various techniques have been proposed to minimize the inrush current; however, the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for this challenge has not been investigated. RL incorporates the ability to learn inrush minimization strategies adjusted to the dynamic transformer operation environment. This study proposes an inrush current minimization framework by combining controlled switching with RL. Depending on the opening angle of the circuit breaker and the remanent fluxes at disconnection, the proposed method learns the optimal closing instant of the circuit breaker. Two RL algorithms have been trained and tested through an equivalent duality-based model of a real 7.4 MVA power transformer. The evaluation of the RL algorithms is carried out with real measurement data and compared with real laboratory inrush currents. The results show that the inrush current is effectively minimized with the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent Abilities in Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05788v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are leading a new technological revolution as one of the most promising research streams toward artificial general intelligence. The scaling of these models, accomplished by increasing the number of parameters and the magnitude of the training datasets, has been linked to various so-called emergent abilities that were previously unobserved. These emergent abilities, ranging from advanced reasoning and in-context learning to coding and problem-solving, have sparked an intense scientific debate: Are they truly emergent, or do they simply depend on external factors, such as training dynamics, the type of problems, or the chosen metric? What underlying mechanism causes them? Despite their transformative potential, emergent abilities remain poorly understood, leading to misconceptions about their definition, nature, predictability, and implications. In this work, we shed light on emergent abilities by conducting a comprehensive review of the phenomenon, addressing both its scientific underpinnings and real-world consequences. We first critically analyze existing definitions, exposing inconsistencies in conceptualizing emergent abilities. We then explore the conditions under which these abilities appear, evaluating the role of scaling laws, task complexity, pre-training loss, quantization, and prompting strategies. Our review extends beyond traditional LLMs and includes Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which leverage reinforcement learning and inference-time search to amplify reasoning and self-reflection. However, emergence is not inherently positive. As AI systems gain autonomous reasoning capabilities, they also develop harmful behaviors, including deception, manipulation, and reward hacking. We highlight growing concerns about safety and governance, emphasizing the need for better evaluation frameworks and regulatory oversight.</p></details> |  |
| **[EPO: Explicit Policy Optimization for Strategic Reasoning in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12486v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities in well-defined problems with clear solutions, such as mathematics and coding. However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning-an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty. Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior. To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) using process rewards and iterative self-play, without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks. Our findings reveal various collaborative reasoning mechanisms emergent in EPO and its effectiveness in generating novel strategies, underscoring its potential for strategic reasoning in real-world applications.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Contextual Similarity Distillation: Ensemble Uncertainties with a Single Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11339v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification is a critical aspect of reinforcement learning and deep learning, with numerous applications ranging from efficient exploration and stable offline reinforcement learning to outlier detection in medical diagnostics. The scale of modern neural networks, however, complicates the use of many theoretically well-motivated approaches such as full Bayesian inference. Approximate methods like deep ensembles can provide reliable uncertainty estimates but still remain computationally expensive. In this work, we propose contextual similarity distillation, a novel approach that explicitly estimates the variance of an ensemble of deep neural networks with a single model, without ever learning or evaluating such an ensemble in the first place. Our method builds on the predictable learning dynamics of wide neural networks, governed by the neural tangent kernel, to derive an efficient approximation of the predictive variance of an infinite ensemble. Specifically, we reinterpret the computation of ensemble variance as a supervised regression problem with kernel similarities as regression targets. The resulting model can estimate predictive variance at inference time with a single forward pass, and can make use of unlabeled target-domain data or data augmentations to refine its uncertainty estimates. We empirically validate our method across a variety of out-of-distribution detection benchmarks and sparse-reward reinforcement learning environments. We find that our single-model method performs competitively and sometimes superior to ensemble-based baselines and serves as a reliable signal for efficient exploration. These results, we believe, position contextual similarity distillation as a principled and scalable alternative for uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning and general deep learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to reset in target search problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11330v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Target search problems are central to a wide range of fields, from biological foraging to the optimization algorithms. Recently, the ability to reset the search has been shown to significantly improve the searcher's efficiency. However, the optimal resetting strategy depends on the specific properties of the search problem and can often be challenging to determine. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework to train agents capable of optimizing their search efficiency in environments by learning how to reset. First, we validate the approach in a well-established benchmark: the Brownian search with resetting. There, RL agents consistently recover strategies closely resembling the sharp resetting distribution, known to be optimal in this scenario. We then extend the framework by allowing agents to control not only when to reset, but also their spatial dynamics through turning actions. In this more complex setting, the agents discover strategies that adapt both resetting and turning to the properties of the environment, outperforming the proposed benchmarks. These results demonstrate how reinforcement learning can serve both as an optimization tool and a mechanism for uncovering new, interpretable strategies in stochastic search processes with resetting.</p></details> |  |

However, since these factors and contexts are difficult to predict and cannot be exhaustively enumerated, traditional learning-based methods have difficulty in ensuring the social attributes of robots in long-term and cross-environment deployments. This letter introduces an online context learning method that aims to empower robots to adapt to new social environments online. The proposed method adopts a two-layer structure. The bottom layer is built using a deep reinforcement learning-based method to ensure the output of basic robot navigation commands. The upper layer is implemented using an online robot learning-based method to socialize the control commands suggested by the bottom layer. Experiments using a community-wide simulator show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art ones. Experimental results in the most challenging scenarios show that our method improves the performance of the state-of-the-art by 8%. The source code of the proposed method, the data used, and the tools for the per-training step are publicly available at https://github.com/Nedzhaken/SOCSARL-OL.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Towards Better Alignment: Training Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning Against Sparse Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11240v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation. However, their practical applications are hindered by the misalignment between generated images and corresponding text prompts. To tackle this issue, reinforcement learning (RL) has been considered for diffusion model fine-tuning. Yet, RL's effectiveness is limited by the challenge of sparse reward, where feedback is only available at the end of the generation process. This makes it difficult to identify which actions during the denoising process contribute positively to the final generated image, potentially leading to ineffective or unnecessary denoising policies. To this end, this paper presents a novel RL-based framework that addresses the sparse reward problem when training diffusion models. Our framework, named $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$, employs two strategies: \textbf{B}ackward progressive training and \textbf{B}ranch-based sampling. For one thing, backward progressive training focuses initially on the final timesteps of denoising process and gradually extends the training interval to earlier timesteps, easing the learning difficulty from sparse rewards. For another, we perform branch-based sampling for each training interval. By comparing the samples within the same branch, we can identify how much the policies of the current training interval contribute to the final image, which helps to learn effective policies instead of unnecessary ones. $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$ is compatible with existing optimization algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$ in improving prompt-image alignment and maintaining diversity in generated images.

Inspired by large language models, tokenized multi-agent policies have recently become the state-of-the-art in traffic simulation. However, they are typically trained through open-loop behavior cloning, and thus suffer from covariate shift when executed in closed-loop during simulation. In this work, we present Closest Among Top-K (CAT-K) rollouts, a simple yet effective closed-loop fine-tuning strategy to mitigate covariate shift. CAT-K fine-tuning only requires existing trajectory data, without reinforcement learning or generative adversarial imitation. Concretely, CAT-K fine-tuning enables a small 7M-parameter tokenized traffic simulation policy to outperform a 102M-parameter model from the same model family, achieving the top spot on the Waymo Sim Agent Challenge leaderboard at the time of submission.

However, the audio modality has largely been overlooked in these developments. Thus, we conduct a series of RL explorations in audio understanding and reasoning, specifically focusing on the audio question answering (AQA) task. We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, and our experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the MMAU Test-mini benchmark, achieving an accuracy rate of 64.5%. The main findings in this technical report are as follows: 1) The GRPO algorithm can be effectively applied to large audio language models (LALMs), even when the model has only 8.2B parameters; 2) With only 38k post-training samples, RL significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), indicating that RL-based approaches can be effective without large datasets; 3) The explicit reasoning process has not shown significant benefits for AQA tasks, and how to efficiently utilize deep thinking remains an open question for further research; 4) LALMs still lag far behind humans auditory-language reasoning, suggesting that the RL-based approaches warrant further exploration.

Operating in remote and resource-constrained environments, these IoT devices face challenges related to energy consumption, crucial for network longevity. Existing clustering protocols often suffer from high control overhead, inefficient cluster formation, and poor adaptability to dynamic network conditions, leading to suboptimal data transmission and reduced network lifetime. This paper introduces Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy with Reinforcement Learning-based Controller (LEACH-RLC), a novel clustering protocol designed to address these limitations by employing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach for strategic selection of Cluster Heads (CHs) and node-to-cluster assignments. Additionally, it integrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to minimize control overhead by learning optimal timings for generating new clusters. LEACH-RLC aims to balance control overhead reduction without compromising overall network performance. Through extensive simulations, this paper investigates the frequency and opportune moments for generating new clustering solutions. Results demonstrate the superior performance of LEACH-RLC over state-of-the-art protocols, showcasing enhanced network lifetime, reduced average energy consumption, and minimized control overhead. The proposed protocol contributes to advancing the efficiency and adaptability of WSNs, addressing critical challenges in IoT deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 15 figures, 4 tables, journal</p></details> |

However, the production mechanism, known as human dynamics, is still undercovered. In this paper, we aim to push data-driven human dynamics understanding forward. We identify a major obstacle to this as the heterogeneity of existing human motion understanding efforts. Specifically, heterogeneity exists in not only the diverse kinematics representations and hierarchical dynamics representations but also in the data from different domains, namely biomechanics and reinforcement learning. With an in-depth analysis of the existing heterogeneity, we propose to emphasize the beneath homogeneity: all of them represent the homogeneous fact of human motion, though from different perspectives. Given this, we propose Homogeneous Dynamics Space (HDyS) as a fundamental space for human dynamics by aggregating heterogeneous data and training a homogeneous latent space with inspiration from the inverse-forward dynamics procedure. Leveraging the heterogeneous representations and datasets, HDyS achieves decent mapping between human kinematics and dynamics. We demonstrate the feasibility of HDyS with extensive experiments and applications.

| **[Improving the Efficiency of a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Power Management System for HPC Clusters Using Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20348v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High energy consumption remains a key challenge in high-performance computing (HPC) systems, which often feature hundreds or thousands of nodes drawing substantial power even in idle or standby modes. Although powering down unused nodes can improve energy efficiency, choosing the wrong time to do so can degrade quality of service by delaying job execution. Machine learning, in particular reinforcement learning (RL), has shown promise in determining optimal times to switch nodes on or off. In this study, we enhance the performance of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent for HPC power management by integrating curriculum learning (CL), a training approach that introduces tasks with gradually increasing difficulty. Using the Batsim-py simulation framework, we compare the proposed CL-based agent to both a baseline DRL method (without CL) and the conventional fixed-time timeout strategy. Experimental results confirm that an easy-to-hard curriculum outperforms other training orders in terms of reducing wasted energy usage. The best agent achieves a 3.73% energy reduction over the baseline DRL method and a 4.66% improvement compared to the best timeout configuration (shutdown every 15 minutes of idle time). In addition, it reduces average job waiting time by 9.24% and maintains a higher job-filling rate, indicating more effective resource utilization. Sensitivity tests across various switch-on durations, power levels, and cluster sizes further reveal the agent's adaptability to changing system parameters without retraining. These findings demonstrate that curriculum learning can significantly improve DRL-based power management in HPC, balancing energy savings, quality of service, and robustness to diverse configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 17 figures, accepted at Supercomputing Asia '25, published by ACM</p></details> |
| **[ReMA: Learning to Meta-think for LLMs with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09501v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on Reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sought to further enhance their performance by integrating meta-thinking -- enabling models to monitor, evaluate, and control their reasoning processes for more adaptive and effective problem-solving. However, current single-agent work lacks a specialized design for acquiring meta-thinking, resulting in low efficacy. To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforced Meta-thinking Agents (ReMA), a novel framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to elicit meta-thinking behaviors, encouraging LLMs to think about thinking. ReMA decouples the reasoning process into two hierarchical agents: a high-level meta-thinking agent responsible for generating strategic oversight and plans, and a low-level reasoning agent for detailed executions. Through iterative reinforcement learning with aligned objectives, these agents explore and learn collaboration, leading to improved generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent RL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level mathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks. Comprehensive ablation studies further illustrate the evolving dynamics of each distinct agent, providing valuable insights into how the meta-thinking reasoning process enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Policy Optimization: Decentralized Wireless Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05970v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces. Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 55% lower average policy error (APE), 35% faster convergence, 50% reduced runtime complexity, and 45% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

To assist researchers to bridge the \textit{sim-to-real gap}, in this paper, we describe a low-cost physical inverted pendulum apparatus and software environment for exploring sim-to-real DRL methods. In particular, the design of our apparatus enables detailed examination of the delays that arise in physical systems when sensing, communicating, learning, inferring and actuating. Moreover, we wish to improve access to educational systems, so our apparatus uses readily available materials and parts to reduce cost and logistical barriers. Our design shows how commercial, off-the-shelf electronics and electromechanical and sensor systems, combined with common metal extrusions, dowel and 3D printed couplings provide a pathway for affordable physical DRL apparatus. The physical apparatus is complemented with a simulated environment implemented using a high-fidelity physics engine and OpenAI Gym interface.</p></details> | <details><summary>Austr...</summary><p>Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA) 2022</p></details> |

In particular, we exploit randomization of heading that the robot must follow to foster exploration of action-state transitions most useful for learning both forward locomotion as well as course adjustments. Changing the heading in episode resets to current yaw plus a random value drawn from a normal distribution yields policies able to follow complex trajectories involving frequent turns in both directions as well as long straight-line stretches. By repeatedly changing the heading, this method keeps the robot moving within the training platform and thus reduces human involvement and need for manual resets during the training. Real world experiments on a custom-built, low-cost quadruped demonstrate the efficacy of our method with the robot successfully navigating all validation tests. When trained with other approaches, the robot only succeeds in forward locomotion test and fails when turning is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Austr...</summary><p>Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA) 2022</p></details> |

One of the main issues is the additional requirements that were not considered during training. To address this challenge, policy customization has been introduced, aiming to adapt a prior policy while preserving its inherent properties and meeting new task-specific requirements. A principled approach to policy customization is Residual Q-Learning (RQL), which formulates the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and derives a family of value-based learning algorithms. However, RQL has not yet been applied to policy gradient methods, which restricts its applicability, especially in tasks where policy gradient has already proven more effective. In this work, we first derive a concise form of Soft Policy Gradient as a preliminary. Building on this, we introduce Residual Policy Gradient (RPG), which extends RQL to policy gradient methods, allowing policy customization in gradient-based RL settings. With the view of RPG, we rethink the KL-regularized objective widely used in RL fine-tuning. We show that under certain assumptions, KL-regularized objective leads to a maximum-entropy policy that balances the inherent properties and task-specific requirements on a reward-level. Our experiments in MuJoCo demonstrate the effectiveness of Soft Policy Gradient and Residual Policy Gradient.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we seek to uncover fundamental statistical limits concerning aligning LLMs with human preferences, with a focus on the probabilistic representation of human preferences and the preservation of diverse preferences in aligned LLMs. We first show that human preferences can be represented by a reward model if and only if the preference among LLM-generated responses is free of any Condorcet cycle. Moreover, we prove that Condorcet cycles exist with probability converging to one exponentially fast under a probabilistic preference model, thereby demonstrating the impossibility of fully aligning human preferences using reward-based approaches such as reinforcement learning from human feedback. Next, we explore the conditions under which LLMs would employ mixed strategies -- meaning they do not collapse to a single response -- when aligned in the limit using a non-reward-based approach, such as Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). We identify a necessary and sufficient condition for mixed strategies: the absence of a response that is preferred over all others by a majority. As a blessing, we prove that this condition holds with high probability under the probabilistic preference model, thereby highlighting the statistical possibility of preserving minority preferences without explicit regularization in aligning LLMs. Finally, we leverage insights from our statistical results to design a novel, computationally efficient algorithm for finding Nash equilibria in aligning LLMs with NLHF. Our experiments show that Llama-3.2-1B, aligned with our algorithm, achieves a win rate of 60.55\% against the base model.</p></details> |  |

The results show that our simple methodology often results in LLM-generated algorithm variants that improve over the baseline algorithms in terms of solution quality, reduction in computational time, and simplification of code complexity, all without requiring specialized optimization knowledge or advanced algorithmic implementation skills.</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual-MPPI: Online Policy Customization for Continuous Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00898v5)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policies developed through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning (IL) have shown great potential in continuous control tasks, but real-world applications often require adapting trained policies to unforeseen requirements. While fine-tuning can address such needs, it typically requires additional data and access to the original training metrics and parameters. In contrast, an online planning algorithm, if capable of meeting the additional requirements, can eliminate the necessity for extensive training phases and customize the policy without knowledge of the original training scheme or task. In this work, we propose a generic online planning algorithm for customizing continuous-control policies at the execution time, which we call Residual-MPPI. It can customize a given prior policy on new performance metrics in few-shot and even zero-shot online settings, given access to the prior action distribution alone. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed Residual-MPPI algorithm can accomplish the few-shot/zero-shot online policy customization task effectively, including customizing the champion-level racing agent, Gran Turismo Sophy (GT Sophy) 1.0, in the challenging car racing scenario, Gran Turismo Sport (GTS) environment.

A multi-objective optimization framework is employed, integrating HOMER Pro for system sizing with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Sensitivity analyses are conducted to evaluate the system performance under varying load demand and renewable energy fluctuations, while an economic sensitivity assessment examines the impact of electricity prices and capital costs on the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). The proposed microgrid configuration achieves high reliability, satisfying 100% of the load, even under adverse weather conditions. The proposed framework attains an efficiency of 91.99% while maintaining a carbon footprint of 302,747 kg/year, which is approximately 95% lower than that of the grid system. The economic analysis indicates a net present cost (NPC) of $4.83M with a competitive LCOE of $0.208/kWh. In addition, the operation cost is $201,473 per year with a capital investment of $1.42M, rendering it a financially viable alternative to conventional grid-dependent systems.This work can be valuable in identifying effective solutions for supplying reliable and cost-effective power to regional and remote areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe Continual Domain Adaptation after Sim2Real Transfer of Reinforcement Learning Policies in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10949v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain randomization has emerged as a fundamental technique in reinforcement learning (RL) to facilitate the transfer of policies from simulation to real-world robotic applications. Many existing domain randomization approaches have been proposed to improve robustness and sim2real transfer. These approaches rely on wide randomization ranges to compensate for the unknown actual system parameters, leading to robust but inefficient real-world policies. In addition, the policies pretrained in the domain-randomized simulation are fixed after deployment due to the inherent instability of the optimization processes based on RL and the necessity of sampling exploitative but potentially unsafe actions on the real system. This limits the adaptability of the deployed policy to the inevitably changing system parameters or environment dynamics over time. We leverage safe RL and continual learning under domain-randomized simulation to address these limitations and enable safe deployment-time policy adaptation in real-world robot control. The experiments show that our method enables the policy to adapt and fit to the current domain distribution and environment dynamics of the real system while minimizing safety risks and avoiding issues like catastrophic forgetting of the general policy found in randomized simulation during the pretraining phase.

The Computational Role of the Base Model in Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07453v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model alignment (or, reinforcement learning) techniques that leverage active exploration -- deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, informative responses -- offer the promise of super-human capabilities. However, current understanding of algorithm design primitives for computationally efficient exploration with language models is limited. To better understand how to leverage access to powerful pre-trained generative models to improve the efficiency of exploration, we introduce a new computational framework for RL with language models, in which the learner interacts with the model through a sampling oracle. Focusing on the linear softmax model parameterization, we provide new results that reveal the computational-statistical tradeoffs of efficient exploration: 1. Necessity of coverage: Coverage refers to the extent to which the pre-trained model covers near-optimal responses -- a form of hidden knowledge. We show that coverage, while not necessary for data efficiency, lower bounds the runtime of any algorithm in our framework. 2. Inference-time exploration: We introduce a new algorithm, SpannerSampling, which obtains optimal data efficiency and is computationally efficient whenever the pre-trained model enjoys sufficient coverage, matching our lower bound. SpannerSampling leverages inference-time computation with the pre-trained model to reduce the effective search space for exploration. 3. Insufficiency of training-time interventions: We contrast the result above by showing that training-time interventions that produce proper policies cannot achieve similar guarantees in polynomial time. 4. Computational benefits of multi-turn exploration: Finally, we show that under additional representational assumptions, one can achieve improved runtime (replacing sequence-level coverage with token-level coverage) through multi-turn exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2: I...</summary><p>V2: Improved number of prompts used by Algorithm 1</p></details> |

Reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategies for human mobility management have recently advanced in addressing the dynamic evolution of cities and epidemics; however, they still face challenges in achieving coordinated control at the township level and adapting to cities of varying scales. To address the above issues, we propose a multi-agent RL approach that achieves Pareto optimality in managing hospital capacity and human mobility (H2-MARL), applicable across cities of different scales. We first develop a township-level infection model with online-updatable parameters to simulate disease transmission and construct a city-wide dynamic spatiotemporal epidemic simulator. On this basis, H2-MARL is designed to treat each division as an agent, with a trade-off dual-objective reward function formulated and an experience replay buffer enriched with expert knowledge built. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model, we construct a township-level human mobility dataset containing over one billion records from four representative cities of varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2-MARL has the optimal dual-objective trade-off capability, which can minimize hospital capacity strain while minimizing human mobility restriction loss. Meanwhile, the applicability of the proposed model to epidemic control in cities of varying scales is verified, which showcases its feasibility and versatility in practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logarithmic Regret for Online KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07460v4)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have shown that KL-regularization plays a pivotal role in improving the efficiency of RL fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs). Despite its empirical advantage, the theoretical difference between KL-regularized RL and standard RL remains largely under-explored. While there is a recent line of work on the theoretical analysis of KL-regularized objective in decision making \citep{xiong2024iterative, xie2024exploratory,zhao2024sharp}, these analyses either reduce to the traditional RL setting or rely on strong coverage assumptions. In this paper, we propose an optimism-based KL-regularized online contextual bandit algorithm, and provide a novel analysis of its regret. By carefully leveraging the benign optimization landscape induced by the KL-regularization and the optimistic reward estimation, our algorithm achieves an $\mathcal{O}\big(\eta\log (N_{\mathcal R} T)\cdot d_{\mathcal R}\big)$ logarithmic regret bound, where $\eta, N_{\mathcal R},T,d_{\mathcal R}$ denote the KL-regularization parameter, the cardinality of the reward function class, number of rounds, and the complexity of the reward function class. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm and analysis to reinforcement learning by developing a novel decomposition over transition steps and also obtain a similar logarithmic regret bound.</p></details> |  |

In order to illustrate those ideas practice, the concrete implementation of the move-generator in FUSc# is discussed and we explain a technique how to verify the move-generator with the "perft"-command. We show that the move-generator of FUSc# works 100% correct. The second part of this paper deals with reinforcement learning in computer chess (and beyond). We exemplify the progress that has been made in this field in the last 15-20 years by comparing the "state of the art" from 2002-2008, when FUSc# was developed, with recent innovations connected to "AlphaZero". We discuss how a "FUSc#-Zero" could be implemented and what would be necessary to reduce the number of training games necessary to achieve a good performance. This can be seen as a test case to the general prblem of improving "sample effciency" in reinforcement learning. In the final part, we move beyond computer chess, as the importance of sample effciency extends far beyond board games into a wide range of applications where data is costly, diffcult to obtain, or time consuming to generate. We review some application of the ideas developed in AlphaZero in other domains, i.e. the "other Alphas" like AlphaFold, AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry and AlphaProof. We also discuss future research and the potential for such methods for ecological economic planning.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[GraCo -- A Graph Composer for Integrated Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13890v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing integrated circuits involves substantial complexity, posing challenges in revealing its potential applications - from custom digital cells to analog circuits. Despite extensive research over the past decades in building versatile and automated frameworks, there remains open room to explore more computationally efficient AI-based solutions. This paper introduces the graph composer GraCo, a novel method for synthesizing integrated circuits using reinforcement learning (RL). GraCo learns to construct a graph step-by-step, which is then converted into a netlist and simulated with SPICE. We demonstrate that GraCo is highly configurable, enabling the incorporation of prior design knowledge into the framework. We formalize how this prior knowledge can be utilized and, in particular, show that applying consistency checks enhances the efficiency of the sampling process. To evaluate its performance, we compare GraCo to a random baseline, which is known to perform well for smaller design space problems. We demonstrate that GraCo can discover circuits for tasks such as generating standard cells, including the inverter and the two-input NAND (NAND2) gate. Compared to a random baseline, GraCo requires 5x fewer sampling steps to design an inverter and successfully synthesizes a NAND2 gate that is 2.5x faster.</p></details> |  |
| **[Antifragile Perimeter Control: Anticipating and Gaining from Disruptions with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12665v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimal operation of transportation networks is often susceptible to unexpected disruptions, such as traffic incidents and social events. Many established control strategies rely on mathematical models that struggle to cope with real-world uncertainties, leading to a significant decline in effectiveness when faced with substantial disruptions. While previous research works have dedicated efforts to improving the robustness or resilience of transportation systems against disruptions, this paper applies the cutting-edge concept of antifragility to better design a traffic control strategy for urban road networks. Antifragility sets itself apart from robustness and resilience as it represents a system's ability to not only withstand stressors, shocks, and volatility but also thrive and enhance performance in the presence of such adversarial events. Hence, modern transportation systems call for solutions that are antifragile. In this work, we propose a model-free deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) scheme to control a two-region urban traffic perimeter network. The system exploits the learning capability of RL under disruptions to achieve antifragility. By monitoring the change rate and curvature of the traffic state with the RL framework, the proposed algorithm anticipates imminent disruptions. An additional term is also integrated into the RL algorithm as redundancy to improve the performance under disruption scenarios. When compared to a state-of-the-art model predictive control approach and a state-of-the-art RL algorithm, our proposed method demonstrates two antifragility-related properties: (a) gradual performance improvement under disruptions of constant magnitude; and (b) increasingly superior performance under growing disruptions.</p></details> | 28 pages, 13 figures |
| **[NIL: No-data Imitation Learning by Leveraging Pre-trained Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10626v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acquiring physically plausible motor skills across diverse and unconventional morphologies-including humanoid robots, quadrupeds, and animals-is essential for advancing character simulation and robotics. Traditional methods, such as reinforcement learning (RL) are task- and body-specific, require extensive reward function engineering, and do not generalize well. Imitation learning offers an alternative but relies heavily on high-quality expert demonstrations, which are difficult to obtain for non-human morphologies. Video diffusion models, on the other hand, are capable of generating realistic videos of various morphologies, from humans to ants. Leveraging this capability, we propose a data-independent approach for skill acquisition that learns 3D motor skills from 2D-generated videos, with generalization capability to unconventional and non-human forms. Specifically, we guide the imitation learning process by leveraging vision transformers for video-based comparisons by calculating pair-wise distance between video embeddings. Along with video-encoding distance, we also use a computed similarity between segmented video frames as a guidance reward. We validate our method on locomotion tasks involving unique body configurations. In humanoid robot locomotion tasks, we demonstrate that 'No-data Imitation Learning' (NIL) outperforms baselines trained on 3D motion-capture data. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging generative video models for physically plausible skill learning with diverse morphologies, effectively replacing data collection with data generation for imitation learning.</p></details> |  |

However, multimodal reasoning, which requires integrating visual and textual information, remains a significant challenge. Existing visual-language models often struggle to effectively analyze and reason visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on complex reasoning tasks. Moreover, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks hinders the accurate assessment of multimodal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce R1-Onevision, a multimodal reasoning model designed to bridge the gap between visual perception and deep reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a cross-modal reasoning pipeline that transforms images into formal textural representations, enabling precise language-based reasoning. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct the R1-Onevision dataset which provides detailed, step-by-step multimodal reasoning annotations across diverse domains. We further develop the R1-Onevision model through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to cultivate advanced reasoning and robust generalization abilities. To comprehensively evaluate multimodal reasoning performance across different grades, we introduce R1-Onevision-Bench, a benchmark aligned with human educational stages, covering exams from junior high school to university and beyond. Experimental results show that R1-Onevision achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming models such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL on multiple challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and Model: https://github.com/Fancy-MLLM/R1-onevision</p></details> |
| **[Correlated Proxies: A New Definition and Improved Mitigation for Reward Hacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03185v4)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Because it is difficult to precisely specify complex objectives, reinforcement learning policies are often optimized using proxy reward functions that only approximate the true goal. However, optimizing proxy rewards frequently leads to reward hacking: the optimized reward function ceases to be a good proxy and the resulting policy performs poorly with respect to the unspecified true reward. Principled solutions to reward hacking have been impeded by the lack of a good definition for the problem. To address this gap, we introduce a definition of reward hacking based on the correlation between proxy and true rewards for states and actions seen by a "reference policy" that breaks down under optimization. We show that this definition captures reward hacking behavior across several realistic settings, including in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Using our formulation, we show theoretically that regularization to the reference policy can effectively prevent reward hacking. While the current practice in RLHF applies a KL penalty between action distributions for this purpose, our theory suggests regularizing the $\chi^2$ divergence between the policies' occupancy measures can be more effective. We intuitively show the benefits of this type of regularization and demonstrate that it better mitigates reward hacking in practice across four realistic settings, including RLHF. Our code is available at https://github.com/cassidylaidlaw/orpo.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Lagrangian Method for Solving Constrained Markov Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10561v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the concept of a Lagrangian game to solve constrained Markov games. Such games model scenarios where agents face cost constraints in addition to their individual rewards, that depend on both agent joint actions and the evolving environment state over time. Constrained Markov games form the formal mechanism behind safe multiagent reinforcement learning, providing a structured model for dynamic multiagent interactions in a multitude of settings, such as autonomous teams operating under local energy and time constraints, for example. We develop a primal-dual approach in which agents solve a Lagrangian game associated with the current Lagrange multiplier, simulate cost and reward trajectories over a fixed horizon, and update the multiplier using accrued experience. This update rule generates a new Lagrangian game, initiating the next iteration. Our key result consists in showing that the sequence of solutions to these Lagrangian games yields a nonstationary Nash solution for the original constrained Markov game.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

Traditional controllers like Regulated Pure Pursuit, Dynamic Window Approach, and Model-Predictive Path Integral, while reliable, struggle to adapt to dynamic conditions. Reinforcement Learning offers adaptability but lacks formal safety guarantees. To address this, we propose a path tracking controller leveraging the Simplex architecture. It combines a Reinforcement Learning controller for adaptiveness and performance with a high-assurance controller providing safety and stability. Our contribution is twofold. We firstly discuss general stability and safety considerations for designing controllers using the Simplex architecture. Secondly, we present a Simplex-based path tracking controller. Our simulation results, supported by preliminary in-field tests, demonstrate the controller's effectiveness in maintaining safety while achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[What is the Alignment Objective of GRPO?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18548v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this note, we examine the aggregation of preferences achieved by the Group Policy Optimisation (GRPO) algorithm, a reinforcement learning method used to train advanced artificial intelligence models such as DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeekMath. The GRPO algorithm trains a policy using a reward preference model, which is computed by sampling a set of outputs for a given context, observing the corresponding rewards, and applying shift-and-scale normalisation to these reward values. Additionally, it incorporates a penalty function to discourage deviations from a reference policy. We present a framework that enables us to characterise the stationary policies of the GRPO algorithm. This analysis reveals that the aggregation of preferences differs fundamentally from standard logarithmic pooling, which is implemented by other approaches such as RLHF. The precise form of preference aggregation arises from the way the reward preference model is defined and from the penalty function, which we show to essentially correspond to the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the aggregation policy and the reference policy. Interestingly, we demonstrate that for groups of size two, the reward preference model corresponds to pairwise comparison preferences, similar to those in other alignment methods based on pairwise comparison feedback. We provide explicit characterisations of the aggregate preference for binary questions, for groups of size two, and in the limit of large group size. This provides insights into the dependence of the aggregate preference on parameters such as the regularisation constant and the confidence margin of question answers. Finally, we discuss the aggregation of preferences obtained by modifying the GRPO algorithm to use direct KL divergence as the penalty or to use rewards without scale normalisation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SySLLM: Generating Synthesized Policy Summaries for Reinforcement Learning Agents Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10509v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policies generated by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms can be difficult to describe to users, as they result from the interplay between complex reward structures and neural network-based representations. This combination often leads to unpredictable behaviors, making policies challenging to analyze and posing significant obstacles to fostering human trust in real-world applications. Global policy summarization methods aim to describe agent behavior through a demonstration of actions in a subset of world-states. However, users can only watch a limited number of demonstrations, restricting their understanding of policies. Moreover, those methods overly rely on user interpretation, as they do not synthesize observations into coherent patterns. In this work, we present SySLLM (Synthesized Summary using LLMs), a novel method that employs synthesis summarization, utilizing large language models' (LLMs) extensive world knowledge and ability to capture patterns, to generate textual summaries of policies. Specifically, an expert evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach generates summaries that capture the main insights generated by experts while not resulting in significant hallucinations. Additionally, a user study shows that SySLLM summaries are preferred over demonstration-based policy summaries and match or surpass their performance in objective agent identification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidence-Controlled Exploration: Efficient Sparse-Reward Policy Learning for Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06192v9)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for robotic navigation, allowing robots to learn through trial and error. However, real-world robotic tasks often suffer from sparse rewards, leading to inefficient exploration and suboptimal policies due to sample inefficiency of RL. In this work, we introduce Confidence-Controlled Exploration (CCE), a novel method that improves sample efficiency in RL-based robotic navigation without modifying the reward function. Unlike existing approaches, such as entropy regularization and reward shaping, which can introduce instability by altering rewards, CCE dynamically adjusts trajectory length based on policy entropy. Specifically, it shortens trajectories when uncertainty is high to enhance exploration and extends them when confidence is high to prioritize exploitation. CCE is a principled and practical solution inspired by a theoretical connection between policy entropy and gradient estimation. It integrates seamlessly with on-policy and off-policy RL methods and requires minimal modifications. We validate CCE across REINFORCE, PPO, and SAC in both simulated and real-world navigation tasks. CCE outperforms fixed-trajectory and entropy-regularized baselines, achieving an 18\% higher success rate, 20-38\% shorter paths, and 9.32\% lower elevation costs under a fixed training sample budget. Finally, we deploy CCE on a Clearpath Husky robot, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning Robotic Policy with Imagined Transition: Mitigating the Trade-off between Robustness and Optimality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10484v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing quadrupedal locomotion learning paradigms usually rely on extensive domain randomization to alleviate the sim2real gap and enhance robustness. It trains policies with a wide range of environment parameters and sensor noises to perform reliably under uncertainty. However, since optimal performance under ideal conditions often conflicts with the need to handle worst-case scenarios, there is a trade-off between optimality and robustness. This trade-off forces the learned policy to prioritize stability in diverse and challenging conditions over efficiency and accuracy in ideal ones, leading to overly conservative behaviors that sacrifice peak performance. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework that mitigates this trade-off by integrating policy learning with imagined transitions. This framework enhances the conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approach by incorporating imagined transitions as demonstrative inputs. These imagined transitions are derived from an optimal policy and a dynamics model operating within an idealized setting. Our findings indicate that this approach significantly mitigates the domain randomization-induced negative impact of existing RL algorithms. It leads to accelerated training, reduced tracking errors within the distribution, and enhanced robustness outside the distribution.</p></details> |  |

In simulating material flow within a sorting process our environment follows the idea of a digital twin, with operational parameters like belt speed and occupancy level. To reflect real-world challenges, we integrate common upgrades to industrial setups, like new sensors or advanced machinery. It thus includes two variants: a basic version focusing on discrete belt speed adjustments and an advanced version introducing multiple sorting modes and enhanced material composition observations. We detail the observation spaces, state update mechanisms, and reward functions for both environments. We further evaluate the efficiency of common RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Deep-Q-Networks (DQN), and Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) in comparison to a classical rule-based agent (RBA). This framework not only aids in optimizing industrial processes but also provides a foundation for studying agent behavior and transferability in evolving environments, offering insights into model performance and practical implications for real-world RL applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 12th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Applications (ICIEA-EU), Munich, 2025.

We first focus on training long COT models from scratch, specifically starting from models initially lacking long COT capabilities. Using a curriculum training recipe consisting of two-stage SFT and semi-on-policy DPO, we train our model Light-R1-32B from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, resulting in superior math performance compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B. Despite being trained exclusively on math data, Light-R1-32B shows strong generalization across other domains. In the subsequent phase of this work, we highlight the significant benefit of the 3k dataset constructed for the second SFT stage on enhancing other models. By fine-tuning DeepSeek-R1-Distilled models using this dataset, we obtain new SOTA models in 7B and 14B, while the 32B model, Light-R1-32B-DS performed comparably to QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1. Furthermore, we extend our work by applying reinforcement learning, specifically GRPO, on long-COT models to further improve reasoning performance. We successfully train our final Light-R1-14B-DS with RL, achieving SOTA performance among 14B parameter models in math. With AIME24 & 25 scores of 74.0 and 60.2 respectively, Light-R1-14B-DS surpasses even many 32B models and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. Its RL training also exhibits well expected behavior, showing simultaneous increase in response length and reward score. The Light-R1 series of work validates training long-COT models from scratch, showcases the art in SFT data and releases SOTA models from RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>all r...</summary><p>all release at https://github.com/Qihoo360/Light-R1</p></details> |

While generative models have shown promise in synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced variability of human driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion planning with diverse driving preferences. TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves PDMS of 93.95 on NavSim benchmark, significantly exceeding other methods. TrajHF sets a new paradigm for personalized and adaptable trajectory generation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Constraint-Based Adaptive Hypergraph Learning for Solving Vehicle Routing: An End-to-End Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10421v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of learning based methods to vehicle routing problems has emerged as a pivotal area of research in combinatorial optimization. These problems are characterized by vast solution spaces and intricate constraints, making traditional approaches such as exact mathematical models or heuristic methods prone to high computational overhead or reliant on the design of complex heuristic operators to achieve optimal or near optimal solutions. Meanwhile, although some recent learning-based methods can produce good performance for VRP with straightforward constraint scenarios, they often fail to effectively handle hard constraints that are common in practice. This study introduces a novel end-to-end framework that combines constraint-oriented hypergraphs with reinforcement learning to address vehicle routing problems. A central innovation of this work is the development of a constraint-oriented dynamic hyperedge reconstruction strategy within an encoder, which significantly enhances hypergraph representation learning. Additionally, the decoder leverages a double-pointer attention mechanism to iteratively generate solutions. The proposed model is trained by incorporating asynchronous parameter updates informed by hypergraph constraints and optimizing a dual loss function comprising constraint loss and policy gradient loss. The experiment results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach not only eliminates the need for sophisticated heuristic operators but also achieves substantial improvements in solution quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[A nonlinear real time capable motion cueing algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10419v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In motion simulation, motion cueing algorithms are used for the trajectory planning of the motion simulator platform, where workspace limitations prevent direct reproduction of reference trajectories. Strategies such as motion washout, which return the platform to its center, are crucial in these settings. For serial robotic MSPs with highly nonlinear workspaces, it is essential to maximize the efficient utilization of the MSPs kinematic and dynamic capabilities. Traditional approaches, including classical washout filtering and linear model predictive control, fail to consider platform-specific, nonlinear properties, while nonlinear model predictive control, though comprehensive, imposes high computational demands that hinder real-time, pilot-in-the-loop application without further simplification. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning for motion cueing, demonstrated here for the first time in a 6-degree-of-freedom setting with full consideration of the MSPs kinematic nonlinearities. Previous work by the authors successfully demonstrated the application of DRL to a simplified 2-DOF setup, which did not consider kinematic or dynamic constraints. This approach has been extended to all 6 DOF by incorporating a complete kinematic model of the MSP into the algorithm, a crucial step for enabling its application on a real motion simulator. The training of the DRL-MCA is based on Proximal Policy Optimization in an actor-critic implementation combined with an automated hyperparameter optimization. After detailing the necessary training framework and the algorithm itself, we provide a comprehensive validation, demonstrating that the DRL MCA achieves competitive performance against established algorithms. Moreover, it generates feasible trajectories by respecting all system constraints and meets all real-time requirements with low...</p></details> |  |

Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CLaMP-DPO in symbolic music generation models with different architectures and encoding schemes. Furthermore, subjective A/B tests show that NotaGen outperforms baseline models against human compositions, greatly advancing musical aesthetics in symbolic music generation.</p></details> |  |

However, most algorithms make a smoothness assumption, which is encoded by a known bounded norm in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The RKHS is a potentially infinite-dimensional space, and it remains unclear how to reliably obtain the RKHS norm of an unknown function. In this work, we propose a safe BO algorithm capable of estimating the RKHS norm from data. We provide statistical guarantees on the RKHS norm estimation, integrate the estimated RKHS norm into existing confidence intervals and show that we retain theoretical guarantees, and prove safety of the resulting safe BO algorithm. We apply our algorithm to safely optimize reinforcement learning policies on physics simulators and on a real inverted pendulum, demonstrating improved performance, safety, and scalability compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel approach, {\it Neuroplastic Expansion} (NE), inspired by cortical expansion in cognitive science. NE maintains learnability and adaptability throughout the entire training process by dynamically growing the network from a smaller initial size to its full dimension. Our method is designed with three key components: (\textit{1}) elastic topology generation based on potential gradients, (\textit{2}) dormant neuron pruning to optimize network expressivity, and (\textit{3}) neuron consolidation via experience review to strike a balance in the plasticity-stability dilemma. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NE effectively mitigates plasticity loss and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various tasks in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite environments. NE enables more adaptive learning in complex, dynamic environments, which represents a crucial step towards transitioning deep reinforcement learning from static, one-time training paradigms to more flexible, continually adapting models.</p></details> |  |

Following this paradigm, domain transfer approaches learn a prior Q-function from the related environments to prevent unsafe actions. However, because of the large number of false positives, some safe actions are never executed, leading to inadequate exploration in sparse-reward environments. In this work, we aim to learn an efficient state representation to balance the exploration and safety-prefer action in a sparse-reward environment. Firstly, the image input is mapped to latent representation by an auto-encoder. A further contrastive learning objective is employed to distinguish safe and unsafe states. In the learning phase, the latent distance is used to construct an additional safety check, which allows the agent to bias the exploration if it visits an unsafe state. To verify the effectiveness of our method, the experiment is carried out in three navigation-based MiniGrid environments. The result highlights that our method can explore the environment better while maintaining a good balance between safety and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACIIDS 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing auto-bidding algorithms fail to accurately capture the auto-bidding problem formulation that the platform truly faces, let alone solve it. Actually, we argue that the platform should try to help optimize each advertiser's performance to the greatest extent -- which makes $\epsilon$-Nash Equilibrium ($\epsilon$-NE) a necessary solution concept -- while maximizing the social welfare of all the advertisers for the platform's long-term value. Based on this, we introduce the \emph{Nash-Equilibrium Constrained Bidding} (NCB), a new formulation of the auto-bidding problem from the platform's perspective. Specifically, it aims to maximize the social welfare of all advertisers under the $\epsilon$-NE constraint. However, the NCB problem presents significant challenges due to its constrained bi-level structure and the typically large number of advertisers involved. To address these challenges, we propose a \emph{Bi-level Policy Gradient} (BPG) framework with theoretical guarantees. Notably, its computational complexity is independent of the number of advertisers, and the associated gradients are straightforward to compute. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the BPG framework.</p></details> |  |

| **[Policy Teaching via Data Poisoning in Learning from Human Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10228v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study data poisoning attacks in learning from human preferences. More specifically, we consider the problem of teaching/enforcing a target policy $\pi^\dagger$ by synthesizing preference data. We seek to understand the susceptibility of different preference-based learning paradigms to poisoned preference data by analyzing the number of samples required by the attacker to enforce $\pi^\dagger$. We first propose a general data poisoning formulation in learning from human preferences and then study it for two popular paradigms, namely: (a) reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) that operates by learning a reward model using preferences; (b) direct preference optimization (DPO) that directly optimizes policy using preferences. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of data poisoning in a setting where the attacker is allowed to augment a pre-existing dataset and also study its special case where the attacker can synthesize the entire preference dataset from scratch. As our main results, we provide lower/upper bounds on the number of samples required to enforce $\pi^\dagger$. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in terms of the susceptibility of these learning paradigms under such data poisoning attacks.</p></details> | In AISTATS 2025 |
| **[Adaptive Preference Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10215v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI alignment, the challenge of ensuring AI systems act in accordance with human values, has emerged as a critical problem in the development of systems such as foundation models and recommender systems. Still, the current dominant approach, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) faces known theoretical limitations in aggregating diverse human preferences. Social choice theory provides a framework to aggregate preferences, but was not developed for the multidimensional applications typical of AI. Leveraging insights from a recently published urn process, this work introduces a preference aggregation strategy that adapts to the user's context and that inherits the good properties of the maximal lottery, a Condorcet-consistent solution concept.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feasible Policy Iteration for Safe Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08845v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety is the priority concern when applying reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to real-world control problems. While policy iteration provides a fundamental algorithm for standard RL, an analogous theoretical algorithm for safe RL remains absent. In this paper, we propose feasible policy iteration (FPI), the first foundational dynamic programming algorithm for safe RL. FPI alternates between policy evaluation, region identification and policy improvement. This follows actor-critic-scenery (ACS) framework where scenery refers to a feasibility function that represents a feasible region. A region-wise update rule is developed for the policy improvement step, which maximizes state-value function inside the feasible region and minimizes feasibility function outside it. With this update rule, FPI guarantees monotonic expansion of feasible region, monotonic improvement of state-value function, and geometric convergence to the optimal safe policy. Experimental results demonstrate that FPI achieves strictly zero constraint violation on low-dimensional tasks and outperforms existing methods in constraint adherence and reward performance on high-dimensional tasks.</p></details> |  |

At its core, PRISM adopts a 3D Point Cloud-Language Model (3D-PC-LLM) to mitigate occlusion and viewpoint biases, ensuring more stable and spatially consistent preference signals. Additionally, PRISM leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to incorporate long-horizon considerations, thereby preventing the short-sighted feedback often seen in static preference comparisons. In contrast to conventional PBRL techniques, this integration of 3D perception and future-oriented reasoning leads to significant gains in preference agreement rates, faster policy convergence, and robust generalization across unseen robotic environments. Our empirical results, spanning tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation, highlight PRISM's potential for real-world applications where precise spatial understanding and reliable long-term decision-making are critical. By bridging 3D geometric awareness with CoT-driven preference modeling, PRISM establishes a comprehensive foundation for scalable, human-aligned reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[HERO: Human-Feedback Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Online Diffusion Model Finetuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05116v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable generation through Stable Diffusion (SD) fine-tuning aims to improve fidelity, safety, and alignment with human guidance. Existing reinforcement learning from human feedback methods usually rely on predefined heuristic reward functions or pretrained reward models built on large-scale datasets, limiting their applicability to scenarios where collecting such data is costly or difficult. To effectively and efficiently utilize human feedback, we develop a framework, HERO, which leverages online human feedback collected on the fly during model learning. Specifically, HERO features two key mechanisms: (1) Feedback-Aligned Representation Learning, an online training method that captures human feedback and provides informative learning signals for fine-tuning, and (2) Feedback-Guided Image Generation, which involves generating images from SD's refined initialization samples, enabling faster convergence towards the evaluator's intent. We demonstrate that HERO is 4x more efficient in online feedback for body part anomaly correction compared to the best existing method. Additionally, experiments show that HERO can effectively handle tasks like reasoning, counting, personalization, and reducing NSFW content with only 0.5K online feedback.

However, existing methods, such as the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm, are often limited to static scenarios and lack the adaptability required for dynamic, narrative-driven applications, particularly in augmented reality (AR) games. This paper presents a reinforcement learning-enhanced WFC framework designed for mobile AR environments. By integrating environment-specific rules and dynamic tile weight adjustments informed by reinforcement learning (RL), the proposed method generates maps that are both contextually coherent and responsive to gameplay needs. Comparative evaluations and user studies demonstrate that the framework achieves superior map quality and delivers immersive experiences, making it well-suited for narrative-driven AR games. Additionally, the method holds promise for broader applications in education, simulation training, and immersive extended reality (XR) experiences, where dynamic and adaptive environments are critical.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 20th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications - GRAPP 2025 https://www.scitepress.org/PublicationsDetail.aspx?ID=LfPv9Lfiya8=&t=1</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel Real-Sim-Real (RSR) loop framework leveraging differentiable simulation to address this gap by iteratively refining simulation parameters, aligning them with real-world conditions, and enabling robust and efficient policy transfer. A key contribution of our work is the design of an informative cost function that encourages the collection of diverse and representative real-world data, minimizing bias and maximizing the utility of each data point for simulation refinement. This cost function integrates seamlessly into existing reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC) and ensures a balanced exploration of critical regions in the real domain. Furthermore, our approach is implemented on the versatile Mujoco MJX platform, and our framework is compatible with a wide range of robotic systems. Experimental results on several robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the sim-to-real gap, achieving high task performance and generalizability across diverse scenarios of both explicit and implicit environmental uncertainties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation-based Reward Modeling for Efficient Safety Alignment of Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10093v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), encounter the challenge of distribution shift. Current approaches typically address this issue through online sampling from the target policy, which requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we hypothesize that during off-policy training, while the ranking order of output generated by policy changes, their overall distribution remains relatively stable. This stability allows the transformation of the sampling process from the target policy into a re-ranking of preference data. Building on this hypothesis, We propose a new framework that leverages the model's intrinsic safety judgment capability to extract reward signals, which are then used to calculate label confidence for preferences reordering. Extensive experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses the distribution shift issue, remarkably enhancing the safety performance while reducing about 300x computational overheads.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Multi-Agent Systems via Reinforcement Learning with LLM-based Planner and Graph-based Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10049v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown great potential in executing complex tasks, but coordination and safety remain significant challenges. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising framework for agent collaboration, but it faces difficulties in handling complex tasks and designing reward functions. The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought stronger reasoning and cognitive abilities to MAS, but existing LLM-based systems struggle to respond quickly and accurately in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-based Graph Collaboration MARL (LGC-MARL), a framework that efficiently combines LLMs and MARL. This framework decomposes complex tasks into executable subtasks and achieves efficient collaboration among multiple agents through graph-based coordination. Specifically, LGC-MARL consists of two main components: an LLM planner and a graph-based collaboration meta policy. The LLM planner transforms complex task instructions into a series of executable subtasks, evaluates the rationality of these subtasks using a critic model, and generates an action dependency graph. The graph-based collaboration meta policy facilitates communication and collaboration among agents based on the action dependency graph, and adapts to new task environments through meta-learning. Experimental results on the AI2-THOR simulation platform demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of LGC-MARL in completing various complex tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA 2025)</p></details> |

Visual sensors like depth cameras enhance stability and robustness but face limitations, such as low operating frequencies relative to joint control and sensitivity to lighting, which hinder outdoor deployment. Additionally, deep neural networks in sensor and control systems increase computational demands. To address these issues, we introduce spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event cameras to perform a challenging quadruped parkour task. Event cameras capture dynamic visual data, while SNNs efficiently process spike sequences, mimicking biological perception. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms traditional models, achieving excellent parkour performance with just 11.7% of the energy consumption of an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model, yielding an 88.3% energy reduction. By integrating event cameras with SNNs, our work advances robotic reinforcement learning and opens new possibilities for applications in demanding environments.</p></details> |  |

However, executing a stochastic policy and evaluating its performance in a continuous-time environment remain open challenges. This work introduces and rigorously analyzes a policy execution framework that samples actions from a stochastic policy at discrete time points and implements them as piecewise constant controls. We prove that as the sampling mesh size tends to zero, the controlled state process converges weakly to the dynamics with coefficients aggregated according to the stochastic policy. We explicitly quantify the convergence rate based on the regularity of the coefficients and establish an optimal first-order convergence rate for sufficiently regular coefficients. Additionally, we show that the same convergence rates hold with high probability concerning the sampling noise, and further establish a $1/2$-order almost sure convergence when the volatility is not controlled. Building on these results, we analyze the bias and variance of various policy evaluation and policy gradient estimators based on discrete-time observations. Our results provide theoretical justification for the exploratory stochastic control framework in [H. Wang, T. Zariphopoulou, and X.Y. Zhou, J. Mach. Learn.

This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI hallucinations in medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published to AAAI-25 Bridge Program</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has driven the growing need for intelligence, efficient, and adaptable wireless networks. Wireless networks require the empowerment of RL-based LLMs while these models also benefit from wireless networks to broaden their application scenarios. Specifically, RL-based LLMs can enhance wireless communication systems through intelligent resource allocation, adaptive network optimization, and real-time decision-making. Conversely, wireless networks provide a vital infrastructure for the efficient training, deployment, and distributed inference of RL-based LLMs, especially in decentralized and edge computing environments. This mutual empowerment highlights the need for a deeper exploration of the interplay between these two domains. We first review recent advancements in wireless communications, highlighting the associated challenges and potential solutions. We then discuss the progress of RL-based LLMs, focusing on key technologies for LLM training, challenges, and potential solutions. Subsequently, we explore the mutual empowerment between these two fields, highlighting key motivations, open challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we provide insights into future directions, applications, and their societal impact to further explore this intersection, paving the way for next-generation intelligent communication systems.

Existing methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), rely on centralized data collection, making them computationally expensive and privacy-invasive. We introduce PluralLLM a federated learning-based approach that enables multiple user groups to collaboratively train a transformer-based preference predictor without sharing sensitive data, which can also serve as a reward model for aligning LLMs. Our method leverages Federated Averaging (FedAvg) to aggregate preference updates efficiently, achieving 46% faster convergence, a 4% improvement in alignment scores, and nearly the same group fairness measure as in centralized training. Evaluated on a Q/A preference alignment task, PluralLLM demonstrates that federated preference learning offers a scalable and privacy-preserving alternative for aligning LLMs with diverse human values.</p></details> |  |

While $H_\infty$ control techniques are commonly used to design robust controllers that mitigate the effects of disturbances, these methods often require complex and computationally intensive calculations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm called Robust Deterministic Policy Gradient (RDPG), which formulates the $H_\infty$ control problem as a two-player zero-sum dynamic game. In this formulation, one player (the user) aims to minimize the cost, while the other player (the adversary) seeks to maximize it. We then employ deterministic policy gradient (DPG) and its deep reinforcement learning counterpart to train a robust control policy with effective disturbance attenuation. In particular, for practical implementation, we introduce an algorithm called robust deep deterministic policy gradient (RDDPG), which employs a deep neural network architecture and integrates techniques from the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) to enhance stability and learning efficiency. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we implement it on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasked with following a predefined path in a disturbance-prone environment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other control approaches in terms of robustness against disturbances, enabling precise real-time tracking of moving targets even under severe disturbance conditions.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[On Generalization Across Environments In Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00799v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world sequential decision-making tasks often require balancing trade-offs between multiple conflicting objectives, making Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) an increasingly prominent field of research. Despite recent advances, existing MORL literature has narrowly focused on performance within static environments, neglecting the importance of generalizing across diverse settings. Conversely, existing research on generalization in RL has always assumed scalar rewards, overlooking the inherent multi-objectivity of real-world problems. Generalization in the multi-objective context is fundamentally more challenging, as it requires learning a Pareto set of policies addressing varying preferences across multiple objectives. In this paper, we formalize the concept of generalization in MORL and how it can be evaluated. We then contribute a novel benchmark featuring diverse multi-objective domains with parameterized environment configurations to facilitate future studies in this area. Our baseline evaluations of state-of-the-art MORL algorithms on this benchmark reveals limited generalization capabilities, suggesting significant room for improvement. Our empirical findings also expose limitations in the expressivity of scalar rewards, emphasizing the need for multi-objective specifications to achieve effective generalization. We further analyzed the algorithmic complexities within current MORL approaches that could impede the transfer in performance from the single- to multiple-environment settings. This work fills a critical gap and lays the groundwork for future research that brings together two key areas in reinforcement learning: solving multi-objective decision-making problems and generalizing across diverse environments.

Traditional methods, where everything was stored in one place, had big problems with keeping information private, handling large amounts of data, and avoiding unfair advantages. Machine Learning has become a powerful tool that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to overcome these challenges. We started by learning the basics of Machine Learning, including the different types like supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. We also explored the important steps involved, such as preparing the data, choosing the right model, training it, and then checking its performance. Next, we examined some key challenges in Machine Learning, such as models learning too much from specific examples (overfitting), not learning enough (underfitting), and reflecting biases in the data used. Moving beyond centralized systems, we looked at decentralized Machine Learning and its benefits, like keeping data private, getting answers faster, and using a wider variety of data sources. We then focused on a specific type called federated learning, where models are trained without directly sharing sensitive information. Real-world examples from healthcare and finance were used to show how collaborative Machine Learning can solve important problems while still protecting information security. Finally, we discussed challenges like communication efficiency, dealing with different types of data, and security. We also explored using a Zero Trust framework, which provides an extra layer of protection for collaborative Machine Learning systems. This approach is paving the way for a bright future for this groundbreaking technology.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional deep learning and Transformer models often struggle to process data with inherent symmetries and invariances, typically relying on large datasets or extensive data augmentation. Equivariant neural networks overcome these limitations by explicitly integrating symmetry and invariance into their architectures, leading to improved efficiency and generalization. This tutorial survey reviews a wide range of equivariant deep learning and control methods for robotics, from classic to state-of-the-art, with a focus on SE(3)-equivariant models that leverage the natural 3D rotational and translational symmetries in visual robotic manipulation and control design. Using unified mathematical notation, we begin by reviewing key concepts from group theory, along with matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. We then introduce foundational group-equivariant neural network design and show how the group-equivariance can be obtained through their structure. Next, we discuss the applications of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks in robotics in terms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The SE(3)-equivariant control design is also reviewed from the perspective of geometric control. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of equivariant methods in developing more robust, sample-efficient, and multi-modal real-world robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Journcal of Control, Automation and Systems (IJCAS), Under Review</p></details> |

However, existing state-of-the-art methods face challenges related to sample complexity, training instability, and the risk of converging to a suboptimal Nash Equilibrium. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for learning stochastic policies to resolve these issues. We embed cooperative MARL problems into probabilistic graphical models, from which we derive the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) objective for MARL. Based on the MaxEnt framework, we propose Heterogeneous-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (HASAC) algorithm. Theoretically, we prove the monotonic improvement and convergence to quantal response equilibrium (QRE) properties of HASAC. Furthermore, we generalize a unified template for MaxEnt algorithmic design named Maximum Entropy Heterogeneous-Agent Mirror Learning (MEHAML), which provides any induced method with the same guarantees as HASAC. We evaluate HASAC on six benchmarks: Bi-DexHands, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, Multi-Agent Particle Environment, and Light Aircraft Game. Results show that HASAC consistently outperforms strong baselines, exhibiting better sample efficiency, robustness, and sufficient exploration.

In this work, we propose CE-U (Cross Entropy Unlearning), a novel loss function for unlearning. CE-U addresses fundamental limitations of gradient ascent approaches which suffer from instability due to vanishing gradients when model confidence is high and gradient exploding when confidence is low. We also unify standard cross entropy supervision and cross entropy unlearning into a single framework. Notably, on the TOFU benchmark for unlearning \cite{maini2024tofu}, CE-U achieves state-of-the-art results on LLaMA2-7B forgetting, even without the use of any extra reference model or additional positive samples. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that the gradient instability issues also exist in popular reinforcement learning algorithms like DPO \cite{rafailov2023direct} and GRPO \cite{Shao2024DeepSeekMath}, as they include a gradient ascent component. This suggests that applying CE-U principles to reinforcement learning could be a promising direction for improving stability and convergence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent LLM Actor-Critic Framework for Social Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09758v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in robotics and large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in human-robot collaboration and embodied intelligence. To enable the broader deployment of robots in human-populated environments, socially-aware robot navigation (SAN) has become a key research area. While deep reinforcement learning approaches that integrate human-robot interaction (HRI) with path planning have demonstrated strong benchmark performance, they often struggle to adapt to new scenarios and environments. LLMs offer a promising avenue for zero-shot navigation through commonsense inference. However, most existing LLM-based frameworks rely on centralized decision-making, lack robust verification mechanisms, and face inconsistencies in translating macro-actions into precise low-level control signals. To address these challenges, we propose SAMALM, a decentralized multi-agent LLM actor-critic framework for multi-robot social navigation. In this framework, a set of parallel LLM actors, each reflecting distinct robot personalities or configurations, directly generate control signals. These actions undergo a two-tier verification process via a global critic that evaluates group-level behaviors and individual critics that assess each robot's context. An entropy-based score fusion mechanism further enhances self-verification and re-query, improving both robustness and coordination. Experimental results confirm that SAMALM effectively balances local autonomy with global oversight, yielding socially compliant behaviors and strong adaptability across diverse multi-robot scenarios.

Often, however, this problem is complicated by uncertain and dynamic package induction rates, which can lead to increased package recirculation. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DRMARL) framework that learns a destination-to-chute mapping policy that is resilient to adversarial variations in induction rates. Specifically, DRMARL relies on group distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to learn a policy that performs well not only on average but also on each individual subpopulation of induction rates within the group that capture, for example, different seasonality or operation modes of the system. This approach is then combined with a novel contextual bandit-based predictor of the worst-case induction distribution for each state-action pair, significantly reducing the cost of exploration and thereby increasing the learning efficiency and scalability of our framework. Extensive simulations demonstrate that DRMARL achieves robust chute mapping in the presence of varying induction distributions, reducing package recirculation by an average of 80\% in the simulation scenario.</p></details> |  |

The reliance on the rolled-out trajectory renders the compute cost and time prohibitively high. In particular, the correctness of a reasoning trajectory can typically only be judged at its completion, leading to sparse rewards in RL or requiring expensive synthetic data generation in expert iteration-like methods. In this work, we focus on the Automatic Theorem Proving (ATP) task and propose a novel verifier-in-the-loop design, which unlike existing approaches that leverage feedback on the entire reasoning trajectory, employs an automated verifier to give intermediate feedback at each step of the reasoning process. Using Lean as the verifier, we empirically show that the step-by-step local verification produces a global improvement in the model's reasoning accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Reasoning and Planning for Large Language Models</p></details> |
| **[Towards Causal Model-Based Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09719v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world decision-making problems are often marked by complex, uncertain dynamics that can shift or break under changing conditions. Traditional Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) approaches learn predictive models of environment dynamics from queried trajectories and then use these models to simulate rollouts for policy optimization. However, such methods do not account for the underlying causal mechanisms that govern the environment, and thus inadvertently capture spurious correlations, making them sensitive to distributional shifts and limiting their ability to generalize. The same naturally holds for model-free approaches. In this work, we introduce Causal Model-Based Policy Optimization (C-MBPO), a novel framework that integrates causal learning into the MBRL pipeline to achieve more robust, explainable, and generalizable policy learning algorithms. Our approach centers on first inferring a Causal Markov Decision Process (C-MDP) by learning a local Structural Causal Model (SCM) of both the state and reward transition dynamics from trajectories gathered online. C-MDPs differ from classic MDPs in that we can decompose causal dependencies in the environment dynamics via specifying an associated Causal Bayesian Network. C-MDPs allow for targeted interventions and counterfactual reasoning, enabling the agent to distinguish between mere statistical correlations and causal relationships. The learned SCM is then used to simulate counterfactual on-policy transitions and rewards under hypothetical actions (or ``interventions"), thereby guiding policy optimization more effectively. The resulting policy learned by C-MBPO can be shown to be robust to a class of distributional shifts that affect spurious, non-causal relationships in the dynamics. We demonstrate this through some simple experiments involving near and far OOD dynamics drifts.</p></details> |  |

We show that existing RLHF methods are not strategyproof, which can result in learning a substantially misaligned policy even when only one out of $k$ individuals reports their preferences strategically. In turn, we also find that any strategyproof RLHF algorithm must perform $k$-times worse than the optimal policy, highlighting an inherent trade-off between incentive alignment and policy alignment. We then propose a pessimistic median algorithm that, under appropriate coverage assumptions, is approximately strategyproof and converges to the optimal policy as the number of individuals and samples increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimisation of the Accelerator Control by Reinforcement Learning: A Simulation-Based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09665v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing accelerator control is a critical challenge in experimental particle physics, requiring significant manual effort and resource expenditure. Traditional tuning methods are often time-consuming and reliant on expert input, highlighting the need for more efficient approaches. This study aims to create a simulation-based framework integrated with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address these challenges. Using \texttt{Elegant} as the simulation backend, we developed a Python wrapper that simplifies the interaction between RL algorithms and accelerator simulations, enabling seamless input management, simulation execution, and output analysis. The proposed RL framework acts as a co-pilot for physicists, offering intelligent suggestions to enhance beamline performance, reduce tuning time, and improve operational efficiency. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the application of our RL approach to an accelerator control problem and highlight the improvements in efficiency and performance achieved through our methodology. We discuss how the integration of simulation tools with a Python-based RL framework provides a powerful resource for the accelerator physics community, showcasing the potential of machine learning in optimizing complex physical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings for Mathematical Modeling and Computational Physics, 2024 (MMCP2024)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning Enables Parameter Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05126v3)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) aims to endow a single agent with the ability to perform well on multiple tasks. Recent works have focused on developing novel sophisticated architectures to improve performance, often resulting in larger models; it is unclear, however, whether the performance gains are a consequence of the architecture design itself or the extra parameters. We argue that gains are mostly due to scale by demonstrating that naively scaling up a simple MTRL baseline to match parameter counts outperforms the more sophisticated architectures, and these gains benefit most from scaling the critic over the actor. Additionally, we explore the training stability advantages that come with task diversity, demonstrating that increasing the number of tasks can help mitigate plasticity loss. Our findings suggest that MTRL's simultaneous training across multiple tasks provides a natural framework for beneficial parameter scaling in reinforcement learning, challenging the need for complex architectural innovations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Search-R1: Training LLMs to Reason and Leverage Search Engines with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09516v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Retrieval augmentation and tool-use training approaches where a search engine is treated as a tool lack complex multi-turn retrieval flexibility or require large-scale supervised data. Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities during inference to use search engines is not optimal, since the LLM does not learn how to optimally interact with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of the DeepSeek-R1 model where the LLM learns -- solely through reinforcement learning (RL) -- to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM rollouts with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 26% (Qwen2.5-7B), 21% (Qwen2.5-3B), and 10% (LLaMA3.2-3B) over SOTA baselines. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

| **[RESTRAIN: Reinforcement Learning-Based Secure Framework for Trigger-Action IoT Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09513v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet of Things (IoT) platforms with trigger-action capability allow event conditions to trigger actions in IoT devices autonomously by creating a chain of interactions. Adversaries exploit this chain of interactions to maliciously inject fake event conditions into IoT hubs, triggering unauthorized actions on target IoT devices to implement remote injection attacks. Existing defense mechanisms focus mainly on the verification of event transactions using physical event fingerprints to enforce the security policies to block unsafe event transactions. These approaches are designed to provide offline defense against injection attacks. The state-of-the-art online defense mechanisms offer real-time defense, but extensive reliability on the inference of attack impacts on the IoT network limits the generalization capability of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a platform-independent multi-agent online defense system, namely RESTRAIN, to counter remote injection attacks at runtime. RESTRAIN allows the defense agent to profile attack actions at runtime and leverages reinforcement learning to optimize a defense policy that complies with the security requirements of the IoT network. The experimental results show that the defense agent effectively takes real-time defense actions against complex and dynamic remote injection attacks and maximizes the security gain with minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

Our model outperforms baselines on four of five benchmarks, demonstrating improved generalization beyond its training data. Notably, response length does not correlate with reasoning quality, and while "aha moments" emerge, they do not always yield correct answers. These findings highlight the potential of RL-only training for reasoning enhancement and suggest future work on refining reward structures to bridge emergent insights with accuracy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Harnessing Causality in Reinforcement Learning With Bagged Decision Times](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14659v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of problems with bagged decision times. A bag contains a finite sequence of consecutive decision times. The transition dynamics are non-Markovian and non-stationary within a bag. All actions within a bag jointly impact a single reward, observed at the end of the bag. For example, in mobile health, multiple activity suggestions in a day collectively affect a user's daily commitment to being active. Our goal is to develop an online RL algorithm to maximize the discounted sum of the bag-specific rewards. To handle non-Markovian transitions within a bag, we utilize an expert-provided causal directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on the DAG, we construct states as a dynamical Bayesian sufficient statistic of the observed history, which results in Markov state transitions within and across bags. We then formulate this problem as a periodic Markov decision process (MDP) that allows non-stationarity within a period. An online RL algorithm based on Bellman equations for stationary MDPs is generalized to handle periodic MDPs. We show that our constructed state achieves the maximal optimal value function among all state constructions for a periodic MDP. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on testbed variants built from real data in a mobile health clinical trial.</p></details> |  |

It is assumed, that all participating signals (the classified object description, correct class label and SNN decision) have spiking nature. The distinctive feature of this architecture is a combination of prototypical network structures corresponding to different classes and significantly distinctive instances of one class (=columns) and functionally differing populations of neurons inside columns (=layers). The other distinctive feature is a novel combination of anti-Hebbian and dopamine-modulated plasticity. The plasticity rules are local and do not use the backpropagation principle. Besides that, as in my previous studies, I was guided by the requirement that the all neuron/plasticity models should be easily implemented on modern neurochips. I illustrate the high performance of my network on a task related to model-based reinforcement learning, namely, evaluation of proximity of an external world state to the target state.</p></details> |  |

To validate their effectiveness, RL algorithms have to be evaluated across multiple case studies. Case study design is an arduous task requiring the consideration of many aspects, among them the influence of available forecasts and the level of decentralization in the control structure. Furthermore, vanilla RL controllers cannot themselves ensure the satisfaction of system constraints, which makes devising a safeguarding mechanism a necessary task for every case study before deploying the system. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Python tool CommonPower, the first general framework for the modeling and simulation of power system management tailored towards machine learning. Its modular architecture enables users to focus on specific elements without having to implement a simulation environment. Another unique contribution of CommonPower is the automatic synthesis of model predictive controllers and safeguards. Beyond offering a unified interface for single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, CommonPower includes a training pipeline for machine-learning-based forecasters as well as a flexible mechanism for incorporating feedback of safeguards into the learning updates of RL controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>For t...</summary><p>For the corresponding code repository, see https://github.com/TUMcps/commonpower</p></details> |

| **[Adversarial Data Collection: Human-Collaborative Perturbations for Efficient and Robust Robotic Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11646v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of data efficiency, where quality outweighs quantity, has emerged as a cornerstone in robotic manipulation, especially given the high costs associated with real-world data collection. We propose that maximizing the informational density of individual demonstrations can dramatically reduce reliance on large-scale datasets while improving task performance. To this end, we introduce Adversarial Data Collection, a Human-in-the-Loop (HiL) framework that redefines robotic data acquisition through real-time, bidirectional human-environment interactions. Unlike conventional pipelines that passively record static demonstrations, ADC adopts a collaborative perturbation paradigm: during a single episode, an adversarial operator dynamically alters object states, environmental conditions, and linguistic commands, while the tele-operator adaptively adjusts actions to overcome these evolving challenges. This process compresses diverse failure-recovery behaviors, compositional task variations, and environmental perturbations into minimal demonstrations. Our experiments demonstrate that ADC-trained models achieve superior compositional generalization to unseen task instructions, enhanced robustness to perceptual perturbations, and emergent error recovery capabilities. Strikingly, models trained with merely 20% of the demonstration volume collected through ADC significantly outperform traditional approaches using full datasets. These advances bridge the gap between data-centric learning paradigms and practical robotic deployment, demonstrating that strategic data acquisition, not merely post-hoc processing, is critical for scalable, real-world robot learning. Additionally, we are curating a large-scale ADC-Robotics dataset comprising real-world manipulation tasks with adversarial perturbations. This benchmark will be open-sourced to facilitate advancements in robotic imitation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>More ...</summary><p>More information can be found on our project page:https://sites.google.com/view/adc-robot</p></details> |

As such, many approaches to enable this vision have been explored with fruitful results. Particularly, object-centric representation methods have been shown to provide better inductive biases for skill learning, leading to improved performance and generalization. Nonetheless, we show that object-centric methods can struggle to learn simple manipulation skills in multi-object environments. Thus, we propose DOCIR, an object-centric framework that introduces a disentangled representation for objects of interest, obstacles, and robot embodiment. We show that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance for learning pick and place skills from visual inputs in multi-object environments and generalizes at test time to changing objects of interest and distractors in the scene. Furthermore, we show its efficacy both in simulation and zero-shot transfer to the real world.</p></details> |  |

First, the robot's unique mechanical design, the dynamics model, and the basic control framework for terrestrial/aerial locomotion are briefly introduced. Second, a vectorable thrust control method derived from the basic control framework for aerial locomotion is presented. A key feature of this extended flight control is its ability to avoid interrotor aerodynamics interference under specific joint configuration. Third, another extended thrust control method and a fundamental gait strategy is proposed for special terrestrial locomotion called crawling that requires all legs to be lifted at the same time. Finally, the experimental results of the flight with a complex joint motion and the repeatable crawling motion are explained, which demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed thrust control methods for different locomotion modes.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 Pa...</summary><p>16 Pages.

After the changes, the team is divided into different groups of robots. The groups have a limited communication range and only a partial information in their field of view about the current scenario. Their objective is to form a chain from a static base station to a goal location. In the proposed distributed replanning approach, the robots predict new plans for the other groups from the new observed information by each robot in the changed scenario, to restore the connectivity with a base station and reach the initial joint objective. If a solution exists, the method achieves the reconnection of all the groups in a unique chain. The proposed method is compared with other two cases: 1) when all the agents have full information of the environment, and 2) when some robots must move to reach other waiting robots for reconnection. Numerical simulations are provided to evaluate the proposed approach in the presence of unpredictable scenario changes.</p></details> |  |

Traditional discrete systems struggle with rough terrain due to limited individual mobility, while modular systems--where rigid, controllable constraints link robot units--improve traversal but suffer from high control complexity and reduced flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Robot System with Controllable Weak Constraints (MRS-CWC), where robot units are connected by constraints with dynamically adjustable stiffness. This adaptive mechanism softens or stiffens in real-time during environmental interactions, ensuring a balance between flexibility and mobility. We formulate the system's dynamics and control model and evaluate MRS-CWC against six baseline methods and an ablation variant in a benchmark dataset with 100 different simulation terrains. Results show that MRS-CWC achieves the highest navigation completion rate and ranks second in success rate, efficiency, and energy cost in the highly rugged terrain group, outperforming all baseline methods without relying on environmental modeling, path planning, or complex control. Even where MRS-CWC ranks second, its performance is only slightly behind a more complex ablation variant with environmental modeling and path planning. Finally, we develop a physical prototype and validate its feasibility in a constructed rugged environment.

| **[Optimal gait design for nonlinear soft robotic crawlers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17058v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots offer a frontier in robotics with enormous potential for safe human-robot interaction and agility in uncertain environments. A stepping stone towards unlocking their potential is a control theory tailored to soft robotics, including a principled framework for gait design. We analyze the problem of optimal gait design for a soft crawling body - the crawler. The crawler is an elastic body with the control signal defined as actuation forces between segments of the body. We consider the simplest such crawler: a two-segmented body with a passive mechanical connection modeling the viscoelastic body dynamics and a symmetric control force modeling actuation between the two body segments. The model accounts for the nonlinear asymmetric friction with the ground, which together with the symmetric actuation forces enable the crawler's locomotion. Using a describing-function analysis, we show that when the body is forced sinusoidally, the optimal actuator contraction frequency corresponds to the body's natural frequency when operating with only passive dynamics. We then use the framework of Optimal Periodic Control (OPC) to design optimal force cycles of arbitrary waveform and the corresponding crawling gaits. We provide a hill-climbing algorithm to solve the OPC problem numerically. Our proposed methods and results inform the design of optimal forcing and gaits for more complex and multi-segmented crawling soft bodies.</p></details> |  |

Current datasets, such as Ego4D, often suffer from inconsistent view perspectives and misaligned interactions, leading to reduced video quality and limiting their applicability for precise imitation learning tasks. Towards this end, we introduce TASTE-Rob -- a pioneering large-scale dataset of 100,856 ego-centric hand-object interaction videos. Each video is meticulously aligned with language instructions and recorded from a consistent camera viewpoint to ensure interaction clarity. By fine-tuning a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) on TASTE-Rob, we achieve realistic object interactions, though we observed occasional inconsistencies in hand grasping postures. To enhance realism, we introduce a three-stage pose-refinement pipeline that improves hand posture accuracy in generated videos. Our curated dataset, coupled with the specialized pose-refinement framework, provides notable performance gains in generating high-quality, task-oriented hand-object interaction videos, resulting in achieving superior generalizable robotic manipulation. The TASTE-Rob dataset will be made publicly available upon publication to foster further advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025</p></details> |

However, the lack of physical world perception in this approach may lead to potential collisions during action optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel improvement on previous efforts by incorporating physical awareness of collisions through the learning of a neural robotic collision classifier. This enables the optimization of actions that avoid collisions with static, non-interactable environments as well as the robot itself. To facilitate effective gradient optimization with the classifier, we identify the underlying issue and propose leveraging Eikonal regularization to ensure consistent gradients for optimization. Our solution can be seamlessly integrated into existing differentiable robot rendering frameworks, utilizing gradients for optimization and providing a foundation for future applications of differentiable rendering in robotics with improved reliability of interactions with the physical world. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our method compared to previous solutions.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel flow-aware navigation and control strategy for magnetic micro-robots that explicitly accounts for the impact of fluid flow on their movement. First, the proposed method employs a Physics-Informed U-Net (PI-UNet) to refine the numerically predicted fluid velocity using local observations. Then, the predicted velocity is incorporated in a flow-aware A* path planning algorithm, ensuring efficient navigation while mitigating flow-induced disturbances. Finally, a control scheme is developed to compensate for the predicted fluid velocity, thereby optimizing the micro-robot's performance. A series of simulation studies and real-world experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach. This method enhances both planning accuracy and control precision, expanding the potential applications of magnetic micro-robots in fluid-affected environments typical of many medical scenarios.</p></details> | 8 |

With the emergence of foundation models, robots can now not only perceive geometric information but also achieve open-vocabulary scene understanding. However, existing map representations that support open-vocabulary queries often involve large data volumes, which becomes a bottleneck for multi-robot transmission in communication-limited environments. To address this challenge, we develop a method to construct a graph-structured 3D representation called COGraph, where nodes represent objects with semantic features and edges capture their spatial adjacency relationships. Before transmission, a data-driven feature encoder is applied to compress the feature dimensions of the COGraph. Upon receiving COGraphs from other robots, the semantic features of each node are recovered using a decoder. We also propose a feature-based approach for place recognition and translation estimation, enabling the merging of local COGraphs into a unified global map. We validate our framework on two realistic datasets and the real-world environment. The results demonstrate that, compared to existing baselines for open-vocabulary map construction, our framework reduces the data volume by over 80\% while maintaining mapping and query performance without compromise.

In particular, we exploit randomization of heading that the robot must follow to foster exploration of action-state transitions most useful for learning both forward locomotion as well as course adjustments. Changing the heading in episode resets to current yaw plus a random value drawn from a normal distribution yields policies able to follow complex trajectories involving frequent turns in both directions as well as long straight-line stretches. By repeatedly changing the heading, this method keeps the robot moving within the training platform and thus reduces human involvement and need for manual resets during the training. Real world experiments on a custom-built, low-cost quadruped demonstrate the efficacy of our method with the robot successfully navigating all validation tests. When trained with other approaches, the robot only succeeds in forward locomotion test and fails when turning is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Austr...</summary><p>Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA) 2022</p></details> |

However, enabling current vision-aware multimodal emotion recognition models for affective human-robot interaction in the real-world raises embodiment challenges: addressing the environmental noise issue and meeting real-time requirements. First, in multiparty conversation scenarios, the noises inherited in the visual observation of the robot, which may come from either 1) distracting objects in the scene or 2) inactive speakers appearing in the field of view of the robot, hinder the models from extracting emotional cues from vision inputs. Secondly, realtime response, a desired feature for an interactive system, is also challenging to achieve. To tackle both challenges, we introduce an affective human-robot interaction system called UGotMe designed specifically for multiparty conversations. Two denoising strategies are proposed and incorporated into the system to solve the first issue. Specifically, to filter out distracting objects in the scene, we propose extracting face images of the speakers from the raw images and introduce a customized active face extraction strategy to rule out inactive speakers. As for the second issue, we employ efficient data transmission from the robot to the local server to improve realtime response capability.

| **[Distributed Multi-robot Source Seeking in Unknown Environments with Unknown Number of Sources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11048v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel distributed source seeking framework, DIAS, designed for multi-robot systems in scenarios where the number of sources is unknown and potentially exceeds the number of robots. Traditional robotic source seeking methods typically focused on directing each robot to a specific strong source and may fall short in comprehensively identifying all potential sources. DIAS addresses this gap by introducing a hybrid controller that identifies the presence of sources and then alternates between exploration for data gathering and exploitation for guiding robots to identified sources. It further enhances search efficiency by dividing the environment into Voronoi cells and approximating source density functions based on Gaussian process regression. Additionally, DIAS can be integrated with existing source seeking algorithms. We compare DIAS with existing algorithms, including DoSS and GMES in simulated gas leakage scenarios where the number of sources outnumbers or is equal to the number of robots. The numerical results show that DIAS outperforms the baseline methods in both the efficiency of source identification by the robots and the accuracy of the estimated environmental density function.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[Fast and Robust Localization for Humanoid Soccer Robot via Iterative Landmark Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11020v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate robot localization is essential for effective operation. Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) is commonly used with known maps but is computationally expensive due to landmark matching for each particle. Humanoid robots face additional challenges, including sensor noise from locomotion vibrations and a limited field of view (FOV) due to camera placement. This paper proposes a fast and robust localization method via iterative landmark matching (ILM) for humanoid robots. The iterative matching process improves the accuracy of the landmark association so that it does not need MCL to match landmarks to particles. Pose estimation with the outlier removal process enhances its robustness to measurement noise and faulty detections. Furthermore, an additional filter can be utilized to fuse inertial data from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and pose data from localization. We compared ILM with Iterative Closest Point (ICP), which shows that ILM method is more robust towards the error in the initial guess and easier to get a correct matching. We also compared ILM with the Augmented Monte Carlo Localization (aMCL), which shows that ILM method is much faster than aMCL and even more accurate. The proposed method's effectiveness is thoroughly evaluated through experiments and validated on the humanoid robot ARTEMIS during RoboCup 2024 adult-sized soccer competition.</p></details> |  |

The key feature of the system is the ability to overcome typical sensing and actuation discrepancies during sim-to-real transfer and to achieve consistent performance without any algorithmic modifications. To accomplish this, a lightweight noise-resistant visual perception system and a nonlinearity-robust servo system are adopted. We conduct a series of tests in both simulated and real-world environments. The visual perception system achieves the speed of 11 ms per frame due to its lightweight nature, and the servo system achieves sub-centimeter accuracy with the proposed controller. Both exhibit high consistency during sim-to-real transfer. Benefiting from these, our robotic system took first place in the mineral searching task of the Robotic Sim2Real Challenge hosted at ICRA 2024.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, accepted for presentation at ICRA 2025.

| **[Optimal Design of Continuum Robots with Reachability Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11000v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multi-joint continuum robots are highly dexterous and flexible, designing an optimal robot can be challenging due to its kinematics involving curvatures. Hence, the current work presents a computational method developed to find optimal designs of continuum robots given reachability constraints. First, we leverage both forward and inverse kinematic computations to perform reachability analysis in an efficient yet accurate manner. While implementing inverse kinematics, we also integrate torque minimization at joints such that robot configurations with the minimum actuator torque required to reach a given workspace could be found. Lastly, we apply an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to find optimal robot dimensions while considering reachability, where the objective function could be the total length of the robot or the actuator torque required to operate the robot. Through three application problems, we show that the EDA is superior to a genetic algorithm (GA) in finding better solutions within a given number of iterations, as the objective values of the best solutions found by the EDA are 4-15\% lower than those found by the GA.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents SERN (Simulation-Enhanced Realistic Navigation), a novel framework integrating virtual and physical environments for real-time collaborative decision-making in multi-robot systems. SERN addresses key challenges in asset deployment and coordination through our bi-directional SERN ROS Bridge communication framework. Our approach advances the SOTA through: accurate real-world representation in virtual environments using Unity high-fidelity simulator; synchronization of physical and virtual robot movements; efficient ROS data distribution between remote locations; and integration of SOTA semantic segmentation for enhanced environmental perception. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-Metric Cost Function (MMCF) that dynamically balances latency, reliability, computational overhead, and bandwidth consumption to optimize system performance in contested environments. We further provide theoretical justification for synchronization accuracy by proving that the positional error between physical and virtual robots remains bounded under varying network conditions. Our evaluations show a 15% to 24% improvement in latency and up to a 15% increase in processing efficiency compared to traditional ROS setups. Real-world and virtual simulation experiments with multiple robots (Clearpath Jackal and Husky) demonstrate synchronization accuracy, achieving less than $5\text{ cm}$ positional error and under $2^\circ$ rotational error. These results highlight SERN's potential to enhance situational awareness and multi-agent coordination in diverse, contested environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review for IROS 2025</p></details> |

Many existing domain randomization approaches have been proposed to improve robustness and sim2real transfer. These approaches rely on wide randomization ranges to compensate for the unknown actual system parameters, leading to robust but inefficient real-world policies. In addition, the policies pretrained in the domain-randomized simulation are fixed after deployment due to the inherent instability of the optimization processes based on RL and the necessity of sampling exploitative but potentially unsafe actions on the real system. This limits the adaptability of the deployed policy to the inevitably changing system parameters or environment dynamics over time. We leverage safe RL and continual learning under domain-randomized simulation to address these limitations and enable safe deployment-time policy adaptation in real-world robot control. The experiments show that our method enables the policy to adapt and fit to the current domain distribution and environment dynamics of the real system while minimizing safety risks and avoiding issues like catastrophic forgetting of the general policy found in randomized simulation during the pretraining phase.

| **[Data-Driven Soft Robot Control via Adiabatic Spectral Submanifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10919v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mechanical complexity of soft robots creates significant challenges for their model-based control. Specifically, linear data-driven models have struggled to control soft robots on complex, spatially extended paths that explore regions with significant nonlinear behavior. To account for these nonlinearities, we develop here a model-predictive control strategy based on the recent theory of adiabatic spectral submanifolds (aSSMs). This theory is applicable because the internal vibrations of heavily overdamped robots decay at a speed that is much faster than the desired speed of the robot along its intended path. In that case, low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds (aSSMs) emanate from the path and carry the dominant dynamics of the robot. Aided by this recent theory, we devise an aSSM-based model-predictive control scheme purely from data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this data-driven model on various dynamic trajectory tracking tasks on a high-fidelity and high-dimensional finite-element model of a soft trunk robot. Notably, we find that four- or five-dimensional aSSM-reduced models outperform the tracking performance of other data-driven modeling methods by a factor up to 10 across all closed-loop control tasks.</p></details> | 33 pages, 19 figures |

Importantly, their passive compliance fundamentally alters contact mechanics by smoothing impacts and distributing forces over large areas. By integrating soft actuators, we can perform high-impact, dynamic, and contact-rich tasks that are challenging or impossible for traditional rigid robots. In order to explore the benefits of passive structural compliance and learn to utilize it effectively, we present a prototype robotic torso named Baloo. Baloo's hybrid soft-rigid design incorporates both adaptability from soft components and strength from rigid components with two meter-long, pneumatic robot arms mounted on a rigid torso. The hybrid design is capable of lifting end effector payloads of up to 19 kg, far exceeding many hybrid robot designs. Such payloads are competitive with similar-sized rigid robots, but with a much higher strength-to-weight ratio. Through 30 physical whole-body grasping experiments, we also demonstrate how a simple control strategy can generalize for effective lifting across six challenging objects with diverse shapes, sizes, and weights. A 100% success rate across all objects--achieved with the simple control strategy--underscores the potential of our hybrid soft-rigid robot design for contact-rich, whole-body tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mechatronics for review</p></details> |

However, ensuring flexible and efficient cleaning of the human body poses challenges as it involves direct physical contact between the human and the robot, and necessitates simple, safe, and effective control. In this paper, we introduce a soft, expandable robotic manipulator with embedded capacitive proximity sensing arrays, designed for safe and efficient bathing assistance. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our soft manipulator, comparing it with a baseline rigid end effector in a human study involving 12 participants across $96$ bathing trails. Our soft manipulator achieves an an average cleaning effectiveness of 88.8% on arms and 81.4% on legs, far exceeding the performance of the baseline. Participant feedback further validates the manipulator's ability to maintain safety, comfort, and thorough cleaning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Graph Diffusion Policy with Kinematic Modeling for Bimanual Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10743v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant success of imitation learning in robotic manipulation, its application to bimanual tasks remains highly challenging. Existing approaches mainly learn a policy to predict a distant next-best end-effector pose (NBP) and then compute the corresponding joint rotation angles for motion using inverse kinematics. However, they suffer from two important issues: (1) rarely considering the physical robotic structure, which may cause self-collisions or interferences, and (2) overlooking the kinematics constraint, which may result in the predicted poses not conforming to the actual limitations of the robot joints. In this paper, we propose Kinematics enhanced Spatial-TemporAl gRaph Diffuser (KStar Diffuser). Specifically, (1) to incorporate the physical robot structure information into action prediction, KStar Diffuser maintains a dynamic spatial-temporal graph according to the physical bimanual joint motions at continuous timesteps. This dynamic graph serves as the robot-structure condition for denoising the actions; (2) to make the NBP learning objective consistent with kinematics, we introduce the differentiable kinematics to provide the reference for optimizing KStar Diffuser. This module regularizes the policy to predict more reliable and kinematics-aware next end-effector poses. Experimental results show that our method effectively leverages the physical structural information and generates kinematics-aware actions in both simulation and real-world</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing systems still face a persistent gap in simultaneously achieving four objectives: accurate tracking of full upper limb movements over extended durations (Accuracy), ergonomic adaptation to human biomechanics (Comfort), versatile data collection (e.g., force data) and compatibility with humanoid robots (Versatility), and lightweight design for outdoor daily use (Convenience). We present a wearable exoskeleton system, incorporating user-friendly immersive teleoperation and multi-modal sensing collection to bridge this gap. Due to the features of a novel shoulder mechanism with synchronized linkage and timing belt transmission, this system can adapt well to compound shoulder movements and replicate 100% coverage of natural upper limb motion ranges. Weighing 5.2 kg, NuExo supports backpack-type use and can be conveniently applied in daily outdoor scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a unified intuitive teleoperation framework and a comprehensive data collection system integrating multi-modal sensing for various humanoid robots. Experiments across distinct humanoid platforms and different users validate our exoskeleton's superiority in motion range and flexibility, while confirming its stability in data collection and teleoperation accuracy in dynamic scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, many existing approaches overlook the importance of object dynamics, limiting their applicability to more complex, dynamic tasks. In this work, we introduce KUDA, an open-vocabulary manipulation system that integrates dynamics learning and visual prompting through keypoints, leveraging both VLMs and learning-based neural dynamics models. Our key insight is that a keypoint-based target specification is simultaneously interpretable by VLMs and can be efficiently translated into cost functions for model-based planning. Given language instructions and visual observations, KUDA first assigns keypoints to the RGB image and queries the VLM to generate target specifications. These abstract keypoint-based representations are then converted into cost functions, which are optimized using a learned dynamics model to produce robotic trajectories. We evaluate KUDA on a range of manipulation tasks, including free-form language instructions across diverse object categories, multi-object interactions, and deformable or granular objects, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

However, real-world robotic tasks often suffer from sparse rewards, leading to inefficient exploration and suboptimal policies due to sample inefficiency of RL. In this work, we introduce Confidence-Controlled Exploration (CCE), a novel method that improves sample efficiency in RL-based robotic navigation without modifying the reward function. Unlike existing approaches, such as entropy regularization and reward shaping, which can introduce instability by altering rewards, CCE dynamically adjusts trajectory length based on policy entropy. Specifically, it shortens trajectories when uncertainty is high to enhance exploration and extends them when confidence is high to prioritize exploitation. CCE is a principled and practical solution inspired by a theoretical connection between policy entropy and gradient estimation. It integrates seamlessly with on-policy and off-policy RL methods and requires minimal modifications. We validate CCE across REINFORCE, PPO, and SAC in both simulated and real-world navigation tasks. CCE outperforms fixed-trajectory and entropy-regularized baselines, achieving an 18\% higher success rate, 20-38\% shorter paths, and 9.32\% lower elevation costs under a fixed training sample budget. Finally, we deploy CCE on a Clearpath Husky robot, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, little previous work has explored more general interfaces that allow for multiple demonstration types. Given the varied preferences of human demonstrators and task characteristics, a flexible tool that enables multiple demonstration types could be crucial for broader robot skill training. In this work, we propose Versatile Demonstration Interface (VDI), an attachment for collaborative robots that simplifies the collection of three common types of demonstrations. Designed for flexible deployment in industrial settings, our tool requires no additional instrumentation of the environment. Our prototype interface captures human demonstrations through a combination of vision, force sensing, and state tracking (e.g., through the robot proprioception or AprilTag tracking). Through a user study where we deployed our prototype VDI at a local manufacturing innovation center with manufacturing experts, we demonstrated VDI in representative industrial tasks. Interactions from our study highlight the practical value of VDI's varied demonstration types, expose a range of industrial use cases for VDI, and provide insights for future tool design.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Previous studies have assumed that robots can form and/or switch between predetermined network topologies with known robustness properties. However, robots with distance-based communication models may not be able to achieve these topologies while moving through spatially constrained environments, such as narrow corridors, to complete their objectives. This paper introduces a Control Barrier Function (CBF) that ensures robots maintain strong $r$-robustness of their communication graph above a certain threshold without maintaining any fixed topologies. Our CBF directly addresses robustness, allowing robots to have flexible reconfigurable network structure while navigating to achieve their objectives. The efficacy of our method is tested through various simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and will appear at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

The controller uses proprioceptive sensor data to estimate external base wrench, that is used for precise control of the robot's acceleration during payload transport. The acceleration is controlled using a combination of admittance control and Control Barrier Function (CBF) based quadratic program (QP). The proposed controller rejects disturbances and maintains consistent performance under varying load conditions. Additionally, the built-in CBF guarantees collision avoidance with the collaborative agent in front of the robot. The efficacy of the overall controller is shown by its implementation on the physical hardware as well as numerical simulations. The proposed control framework aims to enhance the quadruped robot's ability to perform assistive tasks in various scenarios, from industrial applications to search and rescue operations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 20 figures |

The proposed filter is first tested with a benchmark numerical problem to validate the performance with other state-of-practice approaches such as Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) filters and Particle Filter (PF). Then the proposed approach is tested and compared against PF and PGM filters in real-world robotic field experiments to validate its impact for real-world robotic applications. The considered real-world scenarios have partial observability with the range-only measurement and uncertainty with the measurement model. The results show that the proposed filter can handle this partial observability effectively whilst showing improved performance compared to PF, reducing the computation requirements while demonstrating improved robustness over compared techniques.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel imitation learning-based viewpoint planning approach to actively adjust camera viewpoint and capture unobstructed images of the target crop. Traditional viewpoint planners and existing learning-based methods, depend on manually designed evaluation metrics or reward functions, often struggle to generalize to complex, unseen scenarios. Our method employs the Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT) algorithm to learn effective camera motion policies from expert demonstrations. This enables continuous six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) viewpoint adjustments that are smoother, more precise and reveal occluded targets. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, featuring agricultural scenarios and a 6-DoF robot arm equipped with an RGB-D camera, demonstrate our method's superior success rate and efficiency, especially in complex occlusion conditions, as well as its ability to generalize across different crops without reprogramming. This study advances robotic harvesting by providing a practical "learn from demonstration" (LfD) solution to occlusion challenges, ultimately enhancing autonomous harvesting performance and productivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Generalized Adaptive Jacobian Controller for Soft Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04094v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The nonlinearity and hysteresis of soft robot motions have posed challenges in control. The Jacobian controller is transferred from rigid robot controllers and exhibits conciseness, but the improper assumption of soft robots induces the feasibility only in a small local area. Accurate controllers like neural networks can deal with delayed and nonlinear motion, achieving high accuracy, but they suffer from the high data amount requirement and black-box property. Inspired by these approaches, we propose an adaptive generalized Jacobian controller for soft robots. This controller is constructed by the concise format of the Jacobian controller but includes more states and independent matrices, which is suitable for soft robotics. In addition, the initialization leverages the motor babbling strategy and batch optimization from neural network controllers. In experiments, we first analyze the online controllers, including the Jacobian controller, the Gaussian process regression, and our controller. Real experiments have validated that our controller outperforms the RNN controller even with fewer data samples, and it is adaptive to various situations without fine-tuning, like different control frequencies, softness, and even manufacturing errors. Future work may include online adjustment of the controller format and adaptability validation in more scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

A large step for the community are open Vision Language Action models which showcase strong performance in a wide variety of tasks. In this work, we study the visual generalization capabilities of three existing robotic foundation models, and propose a corresponding evaluation framework. Our study shows that the existing models do not exhibit robustness to visual out-of-domain scenarios. This is potentially caused by limited variations in the training data and/or catastrophic forgetting, leading to domain limitations in the vision foundation models. We further explore OpenVLA, which uses two pre-trained vision foundation models and is, therefore, expected to generalize to out-of-domain experiments. However, we showcase catastrophic forgetting by DINO-v2 in OpenVLA through its failure to fulfill the task of depth regression. To overcome the aforementioned issue of visual catastrophic forgetting, we propose a gradual backbone reversal approach founded on model merging. This enables OpenVLA which requires the adaptation of the visual backbones during initial training -- to regain its visual generalization ability. Regaining this capability enables our ReVLA model to improve over OpenVLA by a factor of 77% and 66% for grasping and lifting in visual OOD tasks .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA-2025, Atlanta</p></details> |

We emphasize the interplay between perception and motion planning in decision-making by introducing the concept of occupancy queries to quantify the perception requirements for sampling-based motion planners. Sensor and algorithm performance are evaluated using False Negative Rates (FPR) and False Positive Rates (FPR) across various factors such as geometric relationships, object properties, sensor resolution, and environmental conditions. By integrating perception requirements with perception performance, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach is proposed for efficient sensor and algorithm selection and placement. This forms the basis for a co-design optimization that includes the robot body, motion planner, perception pipeline, and computing unit. We refer to this framework for solving the co-design problem of mobile robots as CODEI, short for Co-design of Embodied Intelligence. A case study on developing an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) for urban scenarios provides actionable information for designers, and shows that complex tasks escalate resource demands, with task performance affecting choices of the autonomy stack. The study demonstrates that resource prioritization influences sensor choice: cameras are preferred for cost-effective and lightweight designs, while lidar sensors are chosen for better energy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 33 images, IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

While state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) excel in environmental perception, they often generate inaccurate or impractical responses in embodied visual reasoning tasks due to a lack of understanding of robotic physical reachability. To address this issue, we propose a unified representation of physical reachability across diverse robots, i.e., Space-Physical Reachability Map (S-P Map), and PhysVLM, a vision-language model that integrates this reachability information into visual reasoning. Specifically, the S-P Map abstracts a robot's physical reachability into a generalized spatial representation, independent of specific robot configurations, allowing the model to focus on reachability features rather than robot-specific parameters. Subsequently, PhysVLM extends traditional VLM architectures by incorporating an additional feature encoder to process the S-P Map, enabling the model to reason about physical reachability without compromising its general vision-language capabilities. To train and evaluate PhysVLM, we constructed a large-scale multi-robot dataset, Phys100K, and a challenging benchmark, EQA-phys, which includes tasks for six different robots in both simulated and real-world environments. Experimental results demonstrate that PhysVLM outperforms existing models, achieving a 14\% improvement over GPT-4o on EQA-phys and surpassing advanced embodied VLMs such as RoboMamba and SpatialVLM on the RoboVQA-val and OpenEQA benchmarks. Additionally, the S-P Map shows strong compatibility with various VLMs, and its integration into GPT-4o-mini yields a 7.1\% performance improvement.</p></details> |  |

A key contribution of our work is the design of an informative cost function that encourages the collection of diverse and representative real-world data, minimizing bias and maximizing the utility of each data point for simulation refinement. This cost function integrates seamlessly into existing reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC) and ensures a balanced exploration of critical regions in the real domain. Furthermore, our approach is implemented on the versatile Mujoco MJX platform, and our framework is compatible with a wide range of robotic systems. Experimental results on several robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the sim-to-real gap, achieving high task performance and generalizability across diverse scenarios of both explicit and implicit environmental uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

We present HumanoidPano, a novel hybrid cross-modal perception framework that synergistically integrates panoramic vision and LiDAR sensing to overcome these limitations. Unlike conventional robot perception systems that rely on monocular cameras or standard multi-sensor configurations, our method establishes geometrically-aware modality alignment through a spherical vision transformer, enabling seamless fusion of 360 visual context with LiDAR's precise depth measurements. First, Spherical Geometry-aware Constraints (SGC) leverage panoramic camera ray properties to guide distortion-regularized sampling offsets for geometric alignment. Second, Spatial Deformable Attention (SDA) aggregates hierarchical 3D features via spherical offsets, enabling efficient 360{\deg}-to-BEV fusion with geometrically complete object representations. Third, Panoramic Augmentation (AUG) combines cross-view transformations and semantic alignment to enhance BEV-panoramic feature consistency during data augmentation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the 360BEV-Matterport benchmark. Real-world deployment on humanoid platforms validates the system's capability to generate accurate BEV segmentation maps through panoramic-LiDAR co-perception, directly enabling downstream navigation tasks in complex environments. Our work establishes a new paradigm for embodied perception in humanoid robotics.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[A Diver Attention Estimation Framework for Effective Underwater Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14447v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many underwater tasks, such as cable-and-wreckage inspection and search-and-rescue, can benefit from robust Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) capabilities. With the recent advancements in vision-based underwater HRI methods, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have the capability to interact with their human partners without requiring assistance from a topside operator. However, in these methods, the AUV assumes that the diver is ready for interaction, while in reality, the diver may be distracted. In this paper, we attempt to address this problem by presenting a diver attention estimation framework for AUVs to autonomously determine the attentiveness of a diver, and developing a robot controller to allow the AUV to navigate and reorient itself with respect to the diver before initiating interaction. The core element of the framework is a deep convolutional neural network called DATT-Net. It is based on a pyramid structure that can exploit the geometric relations among 10 facial keypoints of a diver to estimate their head orientation, which we use as an indicator of attentiveness. Our on-the-bench experimental evaluations and real-world experiments during both closed- and open-water robot trials confirm the efficacy of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Visual sensors like depth cameras enhance stability and robustness but face limitations, such as low operating frequencies relative to joint control and sensitivity to lighting, which hinder outdoor deployment. Additionally, deep neural networks in sensor and control systems increase computational demands. To address these issues, we introduce spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event cameras to perform a challenging quadruped parkour task. Event cameras capture dynamic visual data, while SNNs efficiently process spike sequences, mimicking biological perception. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms traditional models, achieving excellent parkour performance with just 11.7% of the energy consumption of an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model, yielding an 88.3% energy reduction. By integrating event cameras with SNNs, our work advances robotic reinforcement learning and opens new possibilities for applications in demanding environments.</p></details> |  |

While previous research has predominantly focused on functional motion generation, the critical aspect of expressive motion in human-robot interaction remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a novel real-time motion generation planner that enhances interactivity by creating expressive robotic motions between arbitrary start and end states within predefined time constraints. Our approach involves three key contributions: first, we develop a mapping algorithm to construct an expressive motion dataset derived from human dance movements; second, we train motion generation models in both Cartesian and joint spaces using this dataset; third, we introduce an optimization algorithm that guarantees smooth, collision-free motion while maintaining the intended expressive style. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which can generate expressive and generalized motions in under 0.5 seconds while satisfying all specified constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiFi-CS: Towards Open Vocabulary Visual Grounding For Robotic Grasping Using Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10419v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots interacting with humans through natural language can unlock numerous applications such as Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS). Given a text query, RGS determines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot's workspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation. Recent studies leverage powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for visually grounding free-flowing natural language in real-world robotic execution. However, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances of the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi-CS, featuring hierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image and text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text queries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object in 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios: Closed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi-CS features a lightweight decoder combined with a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary settings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide open-set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open-vocabulary performance. We validate our approach through real-world RGS experiments using a 7-DOF robotic arm, achieving 90.33\% visual grounding accuracy in 15 tabletop scenes.

Previous studies that compared different formats of AARs have mainly focused on human teams. However, the inclusion of robotic teammates brings along new challenges in understanding teammate intent and communication. Traditional AAR between human teammates may not be satisfactory for human-robot teams. To address this limitation, we propose a new training review (TR) tool, called the Virtual Spectator Interface (VSI), to enhance human-robot team performance and situational awareness (SA) in a simulated search mission. The proposed VSI primarily utilizes visual feedback to review subjects' behavior. To examine the effectiveness of VSI, we took elements from AAR to conduct our own TR, designed a 1 x 3 between-subjects experiment with experimental conditions: TR with (1) VSI, (2) screen recording, and (3) non-technology (only verbal descriptions). The results of our experiments demonstrated that the VSI did not result in significantly better team performance than other conditions. However, the TR with VSI led to more improvement in the subjects SA over the other conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, conventional deep learning and Transformer models often struggle to process data with inherent symmetries and invariances, typically relying on large datasets or extensive data augmentation. Equivariant neural networks overcome these limitations by explicitly integrating symmetry and invariance into their architectures, leading to improved efficiency and generalization. This tutorial survey reviews a wide range of equivariant deep learning and control methods for robotics, from classic to state-of-the-art, with a focus on SE(3)-equivariant models that leverage the natural 3D rotational and translational symmetries in visual robotic manipulation and control design. Using unified mathematical notation, we begin by reviewing key concepts from group theory, along with matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. We then introduce foundational group-equivariant neural network design and show how the group-equivariance can be obtained through their structure. Next, we discuss the applications of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks in robotics in terms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The SE(3)-equivariant control design is also reviewed from the perspective of geometric control. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of equivariant methods in developing more robust, sample-efficient, and multi-modal real-world robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Journcal of Control, Automation and Systems (IJCAS), Under Review</p></details> |
| **[Vi-LAD: Vision-Language Attention Distillation for Socially-Aware Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09820v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Vision-Language Attention Distillation (Vi-LAD), a novel approach for distilling socially compliant navigation knowledge from a large Vision-Language Model (VLM) into a lightweight transformer model for real-time robotic navigation. Unlike traditional methods that rely on expert demonstrations or human-annotated datasets, Vi-LAD performs knowledge distillation and fine-tuning at the intermediate layer representation level (i.e., attention maps) by leveraging the backbone of a pre-trained vision-action model. These attention maps highlight key navigational regions in a given scene, which serve as implicit guidance for socially aware motion planning. Vi-LAD fine-tunes a transformer-based model using intermediate attention maps extracted from the pre-trained vision-action model, combined with attention-like semantic maps constructed from a large VLM. To achieve this, we introduce a novel attention-level distillation loss that fuses knowledge from both sources, generating augmented attention maps with enhanced social awareness. These refined attention maps are then utilized as a traversability costmap within a socially aware model predictive controller (MPC) for navigation. We validate our approach through real-world experiments on a Husky wheeled robot, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) navigation methods. Our results show up to 14.2% - 50% improvement in success rate, which highlights the effectiveness of Vi-LAD in enabling socially compliant and efficient robot navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent LLM Actor-Critic Framework for Social Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09758v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in robotics and large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in human-robot collaboration and embodied intelligence. To enable the broader deployment of robots in human-populated environments, socially-aware robot navigation (SAN) has become a key research area. While deep reinforcement learning approaches that integrate human-robot interaction (HRI) with path planning have demonstrated strong benchmark performance, they often struggle to adapt to new scenarios and environments. LLMs offer a promising avenue for zero-shot navigation through commonsense inference. However, most existing LLM-based frameworks rely on centralized decision-making, lack robust verification mechanisms, and face inconsistencies in translating macro-actions into precise low-level control signals. To address these challenges, we propose SAMALM, a decentralized multi-agent LLM actor-critic framework for multi-robot social navigation. In this framework, a set of parallel LLM actors, each reflecting distinct robot personalities or configurations, directly generate control signals. These actions undergo a two-tier verification process via a global critic that evaluates group-level behaviors and individual critics that assess each robot's context. An entropy-based score fusion mechanism further enhances self-verification and re-query, improving both robustness and coordination. Experimental results confirm that SAMALM effectively balances local autonomy with global oversight, yielding socially compliant behaviors and strong adaptability across diverse multi-robot scenarios.

In this work, we propose a scalable way to probe this question by generating a benchmark spanning the key moments in 824 major pieces of science fiction literature (movies, tv, novels and scientific books) where an agent (AI or robot) made critical decisions (good or bad). We use a LLM's recollection of each key moment to generate questions in similar situations, the decisions made by the agent, and alternative decisions it could have made (good or bad). We then measure an approximation of how well models align with human values on a set of human-voted answers. We also generate rules that can be automatically improved via amendment process in order to generate the first Sci-Fi inspired constitutions for promoting ethical behavior in AIs and robots in the real world. Our first finding is that modern LLMs paired with constitutions turn out to be well-aligned with human values (95.8%), contrary to unsettling decisions typically made in SciFi (only 21.2% alignment). Secondly, we find that generated constitutions substantially increase alignment compared to the base model (79.4% to 95.8%), and show resilience to an adversarial prompt setting (23.3% to 92.3%). Additionally, we find that those constitutions are among the top performers on the ASIMOV Benchmark which is derived from real-world images and hospital injury reports. Sci-Fi-inspired constitutions are thus highly aligned and applicable in real-world situations. We release SciFi-Benchmark: a large-scale dataset to advance robot ethics and safety research. It comprises 9,056 questions and 53,384 answers, in addition to a smaller human-labeled evaluation set. Data is available at https://scifi-benchmark.github.io</p></details> |  |
| **[Action-Aware Pro-Active Safe Exploration for Mobile Robot Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09515v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe autonomous exploration of unknown environments is an essential skill for mobile robots to effectively and adaptively perform environmental mapping for diverse critical tasks. Due to its simplicity, most existing exploration methods rely on the standard frontier-based exploration strategy, which directs a robot to the boundary between the known safe and the unknown unexplored spaces to acquire new information about the environment. This typically follows a recurrent persistent planning strategy, first selecting an informative frontier viewpoint, then moving the robot toward the selected viewpoint until reaching it, and repeating these steps until termination. However, exploration with persistent planning may lack adaptivity to continuously updated maps, whereas highly adaptive exploration with online planning often suffers from high computational costs and potential issues with livelocks. In this paper, as an alternative to less-adaptive persistent planning and costly online planning, we introduce a new proactive preventive replanning strategy for effective exploration using the immediately available actionable information at a viewpoint to avoid redundant, uninformative last-mile exploration motion. We also use the actionable information of a viewpoint as a systematic termination criterion for exploration. To close the gap between perception and action, we perform safe and informative path planning that minimizes the risk of collision with detected obstacles and the distance to unexplored regions, and we apply action-aware viewpoint selection with maximal information utility per total navigation cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our action-aware proactive exploration method in numerical simulations and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures, 4 algorithms, preprint version of a paper submitted to a journal publication</p></details> |

The simultaneous geometric, kinematic, and physics constraints make this problem especially challenging. Prior work on rearrangement planning often relaxes some of these constraints by assuming dexterous hardware, prehensile manipulation, or sparsely occupied workspaces. Our key insight is that by capturing these constraints into a unified representation, we could empower a constrained robot to tackle difficult problem instances by modifying the environment in its favor. To this end, we introduce a Push-Traversability graph, whose vertices represent poses that the robot can push objects from, and edges represent optimal, kinematically feasible, and stable transitions between them. Based on this graph, we develop ReloPush, a graph-based planning framework that takes as input a complex multi-object rearrangement task and breaks it down into a sequence of single-object pushing tasks. We evaluate ReloPush across a series of challenging scenarios, involving the rearrangement of densely cluttered workspaces with up to nine objects, using a 1/10-scale robot racecar. ReloPush exhibits orders of magnitude faster runtimes and significantly more robust execution in the real world, evidenced in lower execution times and fewer losses of object contact, compared to two baselines lacking our proposed graph structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of final version, accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

With inherent redundancy, MARS can self-reconfigure into different configurations to mitigate rotor or unit failures and maintain stable flight. However, existing works on MARS self-reconfiguration often overlook the practical controllability of intermediate structures formed during the reassembly process, which limits their applicability. In this paper, we address this gap by considering the control-constrained dynamic model of MARS and proposing a robust and efficient self-reconstruction algorithm that maximizes the controllability margin at each intermediate stage. Specifically, we develop algorithms to compute optimal, controllable disassembly and assembly sequences, enabling robust self-reconfiguration. Finally, we validate our method in several challenging fault-tolerant self-reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both controllability and trajectory tracking while reducing the number of assembly steps.

However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual unit according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, We propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

Existing solutions are biased toward only well-trained objects, creating a gap when dealing with new objects. Currently, HRI systems using predefined gestures or language tokens for pretrained objects pose challenges for all individuals, especially elderly ones. These challenges include difficulties in recalling commands, memorizing hand gestures, and learning new names. This paper introduces NVP-HRI, an intuitive multi-modal HRI paradigm that combines voice commands and deictic posture. NVP-HRI utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to analyze visual cues and depth data, enabling precise structural object representation. Through a pre-trained SAM network, NVP-HRI allows interaction with new objects via zero-shot prediction, even without prior knowledge. NVP-HRI also integrates with a large language model (LLM) for multimodal commands, coordinating them with object selection and scene distribution in real time for collision-free trajectory solutions. We also regulate the action sequence with the essential control syntax to reduce LLM hallucination risks. The evaluation of diverse real-world tasks using a Universal Robot showcased up to 59.2\% efficiency improvement over traditional gesture control, as illustrated in the video https://youtu.be/EbC7al2wiAc.

Although extensive research has been conducted in this field, the challenge of rapid traversal through such environments has not been fully addressed. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a novel real-time scheduling scheme designed to optimize the passage of multi-robot systems through complex, obstacle-rich maps. Inspired from network flow optimization, our scheme decomposes the environment into a network structure, enabling the efficient allocation of robots to paths based on real-time congestion data. The proposed scheduling planner operates on top of existing collision avoidance algorithms, focusing on minimizing traversal time by balancing robot detours and waiting times. Our simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme. Additionally, we validated its effectiveness through real world flight tests using ten quadrotors. This work contributes a lightweight, effective scheduling planner capable of meeting the real-time demands of multi-robot systems in obstacle-rich environments.</p></details> |  |

| **[Rethinking Bimanual Robotic Manipulation: Learning with Decoupled Interaction Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09186v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bimanual robotic manipulation is an emerging and critical topic in the robotics community. Previous works primarily rely on integrated control models that take the perceptions and states of both arms as inputs to directly predict their actions. However, we think bimanual manipulation involves not only coordinated tasks but also various uncoordinated tasks that do not require explicit cooperation during execution, such as grasping objects with the closest hand, which integrated control frameworks ignore to consider due to their enforced cooperation in the early inputs. In this paper, we propose a novel decoupled interaction framework that considers the characteristics of different tasks in bimanual manipulation. The key insight of our framework is to assign an independent model to each arm to enhance the learning of uncoordinated tasks, while introducing a selective interaction module that adaptively learns weights from its own arm to improve the learning of coordinated tasks. Extensive experiments on seven tasks in the RoboTwin dataset demonstrate that: (1) Our framework achieves outstanding performance, with a 23.5% boost over the SOTA method. (2) Our framework is flexible and can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods. (3) Our framework can be effectively extended to multi-agent manipulation tasks, achieving a 28% boost over the integrated control SOTA. (4) The performance boost stems from the decoupled design itself, surpassing the SOTA by 16.5% in success rate with only 1/6 of the model size.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

However, previous methods either neglect motion naturalness or rely on unstable and ambiguous style rewards. In this paper, we propose a novel Generative Motion Prior (GMP) that provides fine-grained motion-level supervision for the task of natural humanoid robot locomotion. To leverage natural human motions, we first employ whole-body motion retargeting to effectively transfer them to the robot. Subsequently, we train a generative model offline to predict future natural reference motions for the robot based on a conditional variational auto-encoder. During policy training, the generative motion prior serves as a frozen online motion generator, delivering precise and comprehensive supervision at the trajectory level, including joint angles and keypoint positions. The generative motion prior significantly enhances training stability and improves interpretability by offering detailed and dense guidance throughout the learning process. Experimental results in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that our method achieves superior motion naturalness compared to existing approaches.

The proposed reconfigurable Neuromorphic Navigation framework adapts to the specific needs of both ground robots (Turtlebot) and aerial robots (Bebop2 quadrotor), addressing the task-specific design requirements (algorithms) for optimal performance across the autonomous navigation stack -- Perception, Planning, and Control. We demonstrate the versatility and the effectiveness of the framework through two case studies: a Turtlebot performing local replanning for real-time navigation and a Bebop2 quadrotor navigating through moving gates. Our work provides a scalable approach to task-specific, real-time robot autonomy leveraging neuromorphic systems, paving the way for energy-efficient autonomous navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[FP3: A 3D Foundation Policy for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08950v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following its success in natural language processing and computer vision, foundation models that are pre-trained on large-scale multi-task datasets have also shown great potential in robotics. However, most existing robot foundation models rely solely on 2D image observations, ignoring 3D geometric information, which is essential for robots to perceive and reason about the 3D world. In this paper, we introduce FP3, a first large-scale 3D foundation policy model for robotic manipulation. FP3 builds on a scalable diffusion transformer architecture and is pre-trained on 60k trajectories with point cloud observations. With the model design and diverse pre-training data, FP3 can be efficiently fine-tuned for downstream tasks while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities. Experiments on real robots demonstrate that with only 80 demonstrations, FP3 is able to learn a new task with over 90% success rates in novel environments with unseen objects, significantly surpassing existing robot foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://3d-foundation-policy.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Mutual Adaptation in Human-Robot Co-Transportation with Human Preference Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08895v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mutual adaptation can significantly enhance overall task performance in human-robot co-transportation by integrating both the robot's and human's understanding of the environment. While human modeling helps capture humans' subjective preferences, two challenges persist: (i) the uncertainty of human preference parameters and (ii) the need to balance adaptation strategies that benefit both humans and robots. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to address these challenges and improve task performance through mutual adaptation. First, instead of relying on fixed parameters, we model a probability distribution of human choices by incorporating a range of uncertain human parameters. Next, we introduce a time-varying stubbornness measure and a coordination mode transition model, which allows either the robot to lead the team's trajectory or, if a human's preferred path conflicts with the robot's plan and their stubbornness exceeds a threshold, the robot to transition to following the human. Finally, we introduce a pose optimization strategy to mitigate the uncertain human behaviors when they are leading. To validate the framework, we design and perform experiments with real human feedback. We then demonstrate, through simulations, the effectiveness of our models in enhancing task performance with mutual adaptation and pose optimization.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Recursive Model-agnostic Inverse Dynamics of Serial Soft-Rigid Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07037v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotics is shifting from rigid, articulated systems to more sophisticated and heterogeneous mechanical structures. Soft robots, for example, have continuously deformable elements capable of large deformations. The flourishing of control techniques developed for this class of systems is fueling the need of efficient procedures for evaluating their inverse dynamics (ID), which is challenging due to the complex and mixed nature of these systems. As of today, no single ID algorithm can describe the behavior of generic (combinations of) models of soft robots. We address this challenge for generic series-like interconnections of possibly soft structures that may require heterogeneous modeling techniques. Our proposed algorithm requires as input a purely geometric description (forward-kinematics-like) of the mapping from configuration space to deformation space. With this information only, the complete equations of motion can be given an exact recursive structure which is essentially independent from (or `agnostic' to) the underlying reduced-order kinematic modeling techniques. We achieve this goal by exploiting Kane's method to manipulate the equations of motion, showing then their recursive structure. The resulting ID algorithms have optimal computational complexity within the proposed setting, i.e., linear in the number of distinct modules. Further, a variation of the algorithm is introduced that can evaluate the generalized mass matrix without increasing computation costs. We showcase the applicability of this method to robot models involving a mixture of rigid and soft elements, described via possibly heterogeneous reduced order models (ROMs), such as Volumetric FEM, Cosserat strain-based, and volume-preserving deformation primitives. None of these systems can be handled using existing ID techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time simulation enabled navigation control of magnetic soft continuum robots in confined lumens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08864v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic soft continuum robots (MSCRs) have emerged as a promising technology for minimally invasive interventions, offering enhanced dexterity and remote-controlled navigation in confined lumens. Unlike conventional guidewires with pre-shaped tips, MSCRs feature a magnetic tip that actively bends under applied magnetic fields. Despite extensive studies in modeling and simulation, achieving real-time navigation control of MSCRs in confined lumens remains a significant challenge. The primary reasons are due to robot-lumen contact interactions and computational limitations in modeling MSCR nonlinear behavior under magnetic actuation. Existing approaches, such as Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations and energy-minimization techniques, suffer from high computational costs and oversimplified contact interactions, making them impractical for real-world applications. In this work, we develop a real-time simulation and navigation control framework that integrates hard-magnetic elastic rod theory, formulated within the Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) framework, with an order-reduced contact handling strategy. Our approach captures large deformations and complex interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. Next, the navigation control problem is formulated as an inverse design task, where optimal magnetic fields are computed in real time by minimizing the constrained forces and enhancing navigation accuracy. We validate the proposed framework through comprehensive numerical simulations and experimental studies, demonstrating its robustness, efficiency, and accuracy. The results show that our method significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high-fidelity modeling, making it feasible for real-time deployment in clinical settings.</p></details> | 22 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Towards Motion Compensation in Autonomous Robotic Subretinal Injections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18521v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exudative (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in older adults, typically treated with intravitreal injections. Emerging therapies, such as subretinal injections of stem cells, gene therapy, small molecules and RPE cells require precise delivery to avoid damaging delicate retinal structures. Robotic systems can potentially offer the necessary precision for these procedures. This paper presents a novel approach for motion compensation in robotic subretinal injections, utilizing real time Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The proposed method leverages B$^5$-scans, a rapid acquisition of small-volume OCT data, for dynamic tracking of retinal motion along the Z-axis, compensating for physiological movements such as breathing and heartbeat. Validation experiments on ex vivo porcine eyes revealed challenges in maintaining a consistent tool-to-retina distance, with deviations of up to 200 $\mu m$ for 100 $\mu m$ amplitude motions and over 80 $\mu m$ for 25 $\mu m$ amplitude motions over one minute. Subretinal injections faced additional difficulties, with phase shifts causing the needle to move off-target and inject into the vitreous. These results highlight the need for improved motion prediction and horizontal stability to enhance the accuracy and safety of robotic subretinal procedures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Deformation-aware Control for Autonomous Robotic Subretinal Injection under iOCT Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06557v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic platforms provide consistent and precise tool positioning that significantly enhances retinal microsurgery. Integrating such systems with intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) enables image-guided robotic interventions, allowing autonomous performance of advanced treatments, such as injecting therapeutic agents into the subretinal space. However, tissue deformations due to tool-tissue interactions constitute a significant challenge in autonomous iOCT-guided robotic subretinal injections. Such interactions impact correct needle positioning and procedure outcomes. This paper presents a novel method for autonomous subretinal injection under iOCT guidance that considers tissue deformations during the insertion procedure. The technique is achieved through real-time segmentation and 3D reconstruction of the surgical scene from densely sampled iOCT B-scans, which we refer to as B${^5}$-scans. Using B${^5}$-scans we monitor the position of the instrument relative to a virtual target layer between the ILM and RPE. Our experiments on ex vivo porcine eyes demonstrate dynamic adjustment of the insertion depth and overall improved accuracy in needle positioning compared to prior autonomous insertion approaches. Compared to a 35% success rate in subretinal bleb generation with previous approaches, our method reliably created subretinal blebs in 90% our experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Robot Constitutions & Benchmarks for Semantic Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08663v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Until recently, robotics safety research was predominantly about collision avoidance and hazard reduction in the immediate vicinity of a robot. Since the advent of large vision and language models (VLMs), robots are now also capable of higher-level semantic scene understanding and natural language interactions with humans. Despite their known vulnerabilities (e.g. hallucinations or jail-breaking), VLMs are being handed control of robots capable of physical contact with the real world. This can lead to dangerous behaviors, making semantic safety for robots a matter of immediate concern. Our contributions in this paper are two fold: first, to address these emerging risks, we release the ASIMOV Benchmark, a large-scale and comprehensive collection of datasets for evaluating and improving semantic safety of foundation models serving as robot brains. Our data generation recipe is highly scalable: by leveraging text and image generation techniques, we generate undesirable situations from real-world visual scenes and human injury reports from hospitals. Secondly, we develop a framework to automatically generate robot constitutions from real-world data to steer a robot's behavior using Constitutional AI mechanisms. We propose a novel auto-amending process that is able to introduce nuances in written rules of behavior; this can lead to increased alignment with human preferences on behavior desirability and safety. We explore trade-offs between generality and specificity across a diverse set of constitutions of different lengths, and demonstrate that a robot is able to effectively reject unconstitutional actions. We measure a top alignment rate of 84.3% on the ASIMOV Benchmark using generated constitutions, outperforming no-constitution baselines and human-written constitutions.

Inspired by robotic learning via guided human expert demonstration, we here propose a novel cross-embodiment robotic manipulation algorithm via CycleVAE and human behavior transformer. First, we utilize unsupervised CycleVAE together with a bidirectional subspace alignment algorithm to align latent motion sequences between cross-embodiments. Second, we propose a casual human behavior transformer design to learn the intrinsic motion dynamics of human expert demonstrations. During the test case, we leverage the proposed transformer for the human expert demonstration generation, which will be aligned using CycleVAE for the final human-robotic manipulation synthesis. We validated our proposed algorithm through extensive experiments using a dexterous robotic manipulator with the robotic hand. Our results successfully generate smooth trajectories across intricate tasks, outperforming prior learning-based robotic motion planning algorithms. These results have implications for performing unsupervised cross-embodiment alignment and future autonomous robotics design.

Manual radioactive target detection based on visual display or audible indication of gamma level is highly dependent on the ability of the surgeon to track and interpret the spatial information. This paper presents a learning-based method to realize the autonomous radiotracer detection in robot-assisted surgeries by navigating the probe to the radioactive target. We proposed novel hybrid approach that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with adaptive robotic scanning. The adaptive grid-based scanning could provide initial direction estimation while the DRL-based agent could efficiently navigate to the target utilising historical data. Simulation experiments demonstrate a 95% success rate, and improved efficiency and robustness compared to conventional techniques. Real-world evaluation on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) further confirms the feasibility of the approach, achieving an 80% success rate in radiotracer detection. This method has the potential to enhance consistency, reduce operator dependency, and improve procedural accuracy in radioguided surgeries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

While point-wise assessment has many potential applications, incorporating automated large-area scanning would enable holistic tissue sampling with higher consistency. We propose a robotic system to facilitate autonomous DRS scanning with hybrid visual servoing control. A specially designed height compensation module enables precise contact condition control. The evaluation results show that the system can accurately execute the scanning command and acquire consistent DRS spectra with comparable results to the manual collection, which is the current gold standard protocol. Integrating the proposed system into surgery lays the groundwork for autonomous intra-operative DRS tissue assessment with high reliability and repeatability. This could reduce the need for manual scanning by the surgeon while ensuring complete tumor removal in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

However, the computational constraints of real-time learning on robots pose a significant challenge. We present a framework for efficiently learning quadruped locomotion in just 8 minutes of raw real-time training utilizing the sample efficiency and minimal computational overhead of the new off-policy algorithm CrossQ. We investigate two control architectures: Predicting joint target positions for agile, high-speed locomotion and Central Pattern Generators for stable, natural gaits. While prior work focused on learning simple forward gaits, our framework extends on-robot learning to omnidirectional locomotion. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach in different indoor and outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |

Compared to traditional model-based control algorithms, reinforcement learning based algorithms demonstrate substantial advantages in handling complex tasks. Leveraging the large-scale parallel computing capabilities of GPUs, contemporary humanoid robots can undergo extensive parallel training in simulated environments. A physical simulation platform capable of large-scale parallel training is crucial for the development of humanoid robots. As one of the most complex robot forms, humanoid robots typically possess intricate mechanical structures, encompassing numerous series and parallel mechanisms. However, many reinforcement learning based humanoid robot control algorithms currently employ open-loop topologies during training, deferring the conversion to series-parallel structures until the sim2real phase. This approach is primarily due to the limitations of physics engines, as current GPU-based physics engines often only support open-loop topologies or have limited capabilities in simulating multi-rigid-body closed-loop topologies. For enabling reinforcement learning-based humanoid robot control algorithms to train in large-scale parallel environments, we propose a novel training method LiPS. By incorporating multi-rigid-body dynamics modeling in the simulation environment, we significantly reduce the sim2real gap and the difficulty of converting to parallel structures during model deployment, thereby robustly supporting large-scale reinforcement learning for humanoid robots.</p></details> |  |

With breakthroughs in various types of artificial intelligence algorithms, embodied intelligence, exemplified by humanoid robots, has been highly anticipated.

While current ISO standards emphasize risk assessment and hazard identification, these procedures are often insufficient for addressing the complexity of HRC environments, which involve numerous design factors and dynamic interactions. This publication presents a method for objective hazard analysis to support Dynamic Risk Assessment, extending beyond reliance on expert knowledge. The approach monitors scene parameters, such as the distance between human body parts and the cobot, as well as the cobot`s Cartesian velocity. Additionally, an anthropocentric parameter focusing on the orientation of the human head within the collaborative workspace is introduced. These parameters are transformed into hazard indicators using non-linear heuristic functions. The hazard indicators are then aggregated to estimate the total hazard level of a given scenario. The proposed method is evaluated using an industrial dataset that depicts various interactions between a human operator and a cobot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distillation-PPO: A Novel Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning Framework for Humanoid Robot Perceptive Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08299v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, humanoid robots have garnered significant attention from both academia and industry due to their high adaptability to environments and human-like characteristics. With the rapid advancement of reinforcement learning, substantial progress has been made in the walking control of humanoid robots. However, existing methods still face challenges when dealing with complex environments and irregular terrains. In the field of perceptive locomotion, existing approaches are generally divided into two-stage methods and end-to-end methods. Two-stage methods first train a teacher policy in a simulated environment and then use distillation techniques, such as DAgger, to transfer the privileged information learned as latent features or actions to the student policy. End-to-end methods, on the other hand, forgo the learning of privileged information and directly learn policies from a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) through reinforcement learning. However, due to the lack of supervision from a teacher policy, end-to-end methods often face difficulties in training and exhibit unstable performance in real-world applications. This paper proposes an innovative two-stage perceptive locomotion framework that combines the advantages of teacher policies learned in a fully observable Markov decision process (MDP) to regularize and supervise the student policy. At the same time, it leverages the characteristics of reinforcement learning to ensure that the student policy can continue to learn in a POMDP, thereby enhancing the model's upper bound. Our experimental results demonstrate that our two-stage training framework achieves higher training efficiency and stability in simulated environments, while also exhibiting better robustness and generalization capabilities in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

As global environmental challenges intensify, robotics offers a powerful solution to reduce chemical usage while meeting the increasing demands for food production. However, significant challenges remain in ensuring the autonomy and resilience of robots operating in unstructured agricultural environments. Obstacles such as crops and tall grass, which are deformable, must be identified as safely traversable, compared to rigid obstacles. To address this, we propose a new traversability analysis method based on a 3D spectral map reconstructed using a LIDAR and a multispectral camera. This approach enables the robot to distinguish between safe and unsafe collisions with deformable obstacles. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of multispectral metrics for vegetation detection and incorporate these metrics into an augmented environmental map. Utilizing this map, we compute a physics-based traversability metric that accounts for the robot's weight and size, ensuring safe navigation over deformable obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA25)</p></details> |

However, previous studies have primarily focused on detecting and analyzing objects or robots, with limited attention to ensuring safety, which is critical for clinical applications, where accidents can be caused by unsafe robot motions. In this study, we propose a new control framework that can formally ensure the safety of automating certain processes involved in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), a representative endoscopic surgical method for the treatment of early GI cancer, by using an endoscopic robot. The proposed framework utilizes Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to accurately identify the boundaries of individual tumors, even in close proximity within the GI tract, ensuring precise treatment and removal while preserving the surrounding normal tissue. Additionally, by adopting a model-free control scheme, safety assurance is made possible even in endoscopic robotic systems where dynamic modeling is challenging. We demonstrate the proposed framework in cases where the tumors to be removed are close to each other, showing that the safety constraints are enforced. We show that the model-free CBF-based controlled robot eliminates one tumor completely without damaging it, while not invading another nearby tumor.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to IEEE Access</p></details> |

Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks. To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interaction-Aware Multi-Robot Kinodynamic Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16445v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kinodynamic motion planning for a multi-robot system with different dynamics and actuation limits is a challenging problem. The difficulty increases with the presence of an aerodynamic interaction force that occur in aerial robots flying in close-proximity. Due to these complexities, existing planners either rely on simplified assumption like ignoring robot dynamics, interaction forces or produce highly suboptimal solutions. This paper presents a kinodynamic motion planner for a heterogeneous team of robots that respects robot dynamics and directly reasons about interaction forces between aerial robots operating in close-proximity. Our method, db-ECBS, generalizes the multi-agent path finding method Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS) to the continuous domain by using the single-robot kinodynamic motion planner discontinuity-bounded A*. Db-ECBS operates on three levels. Initially, individual robot trajectories are computed using a graph search that allows bounded discontinuities between precomputed motion primitives. The second level identifies inter-robot collisions, interaction force violations and resolves them by imposing constraints on the first level. The third and final level uses the resulting solution with discontinuities as an initial guess for a joint space trajectory optimization. The procedure is repeated with a reduced discontinuity bound resulting in a anytime, probabilistically complete, and asymptotically bounded suboptimal planner. We provide a benchmark of 65 problems with six different dynamics. We demonstrate that db-ECBS produces trajectories that are less than half the cost of existing planners. We show that the interaction-awareness is in particular important for very dense scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is currently under review</p></details> |

FIRs, because of their small weight and size, offer unparalleled advantages in terms of material cost and scalability. However, their size introduces considerable control challenges, notably high-speed dynamics, restricted power, and limited payload capacity. While there have been advancements in developing lightweight sensors, often drawing inspiration from biological systems, no sub-gram aircraft has been able to attain sustained hover without relying on feedback from external sensing such as a motion capture system. The lightest vehicle capable of sustained hovering -- the first level of ``sensor autonomy'' -- is the much larger 28 g Crazyflie. Previous work reported a reduction in size of that vehicle's avionics suite to 187 mg and 21 mW. Here, we report a further reduction in mass and power to only 78.4 mg and 15 mW. We replaced the laser rangefinder with a lighter and more efficient pressure sensor, and built a smaller optic flow sensor around a global-shutter imaging chip. A Kalman Filter (KF) fuses these measurements to estimate the state variables that are needed to control hover: pitch angle, translational velocity, and altitude. Our system achieved performance comparable to that of the Crazyflie's estimator while in flight, with root mean squared errors of 1.573 deg, 0.186 m/s, and 0.136 m, respectively, relative to motion capture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches often fail to address these challenges simultaneously, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle this, we propose ATA-HRL, an adaptive task allocation framework using hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), which incorporates initial task allocation (ITA) that leverages team heterogeneity and conditional task reallocation in response to dynamic operational states. Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary state representation learning task to manage information uncertainty and enhance task execution. Through an extensive case study in large-scale environmental monitoring tasks, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[Personalization in Human-Robot Interaction through Preference-based Action Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13822v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has shown significant promise for personalization in human-robot interaction (HRI) by explicitly integrating human preferences into the robot learning process. However, existing practices often require training a personalized robot policy from scratch, resulting in inefficient use of human feedback. In this paper, we propose preference-based action representation learning (PbARL), an efficient fine-tuning method that decouples common task structure from preference by leveraging pre-trained robot policies. Instead of directly fine-tuning the pre-trained policy with human preference, PbARL uses it as a reference for an action representation learning task that maximizes the mutual information between the pre-trained source domain and the target user preference-aligned domain. This approach allows the robot to personalize its behaviors while preserving original task performance and eliminates the need for extensive prior information from the source domain, thereby enhancing efficiency and practicality in real-world HRI scenarios. Empirical results on the Assistive Gym benchmark and a real-world user study (N=8) demonstrate the benefits of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

We develop a modular approach, where a large language model (LLM) translates the natural language instructions into a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula with propositions defined by object classes in a semantic occupancy map. The LTL formula and the semantic occupancy map are provided to a motion planning algorithm to generate a collision-free robot path that satisfies the natural language instructions. Our main contribution is LTLCodeGen, a method to translate natural language to syntactically correct LTL using code generation. We demonstrate the complete task planning method in real-world experiments involving human speech to provide navigation instructions to a mobile robot. We also thoroughly evaluate our approach in simulated and real-world experiments in comparison to end-to-end LLM task planning and state-of-the-art LLM-to-LTL translation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligent Framework for Human-Robot Collaboration: Safety, Dynamic Ergonomics, and Adaptive Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07901v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of collaborative robots into industrial environments has improved productivity, but has also highlighted significant challenges related to operator safety and ergonomics. This paper proposes an innovative framework that integrates advanced visual perception technologies, real-time ergonomic monitoring, and Behaviour Tree (BT)-based adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional methods, which often operate in isolation or statically, our approach combines deep learning models (YOLO11 and SlowOnly), advanced tracking (Unscented Kalman Filter) and dynamic ergonomic assessments (OWAS), offering a modular, scalable and adaptive system. Experimental results show that the framework outperforms previous methods in several aspects: accuracy in detecting postures and actions, adaptivity in managing human-robot interactions, and ability to reduce ergonomic risk through timely robotic interventions. In particular, the visual perception module showed superiority over YOLOv9 and YOLOv8, while real-time ergonomic monitoring eliminated the limitations of static analysis. Adaptive role management, made possible by the Behaviour Tree, provided greater responsiveness than rule-based systems, making the framework suitable for complex industrial scenarios. Our system demonstrated a 92.5\% accuracy in grasping intention recognition and successfully classified ergonomic risks with real-time responsiveness (average latency of 0.57 seconds), enabling timely robotic</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pagine, 10 figure, 3 tabelle, formato conferenza IEEE</p></details> |
| **[Safety Guardrails for LLM-Enabled Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07885v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked transformative capabilities, it has also introduced significant safety concerns, ranging from average-case LLM errors (e.g., hallucinations) to adversarial jailbreaking attacks, which can produce harmful robot behavior in real-world settings. Traditional robot safety approaches do not address the novel vulnerabilities of LLMs, and current LLM safety guardrails overlook the physical risks posed by robots operating in dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose RoboGuard, a two-stage guardrail architecture to ensure the safety of LLM-enabled robots. RoboGuard first contextualizes pre-defined safety rules by grounding them in the robot's environment using a root-of-trust LLM, which employs chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to generate rigorous safety specifications, such as temporal logic constraints. RoboGuard then resolves potential conflicts between these contextual safety specifications and a possibly unsafe plan using temporal logic control synthesis, which ensures safety compliance while minimally violating user preferences. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments that consider worst-case jailbreaking attacks, we demonstrate that RoboGuard reduces the execution of unsafe plans from 92% to below 2.5% without compromising performance on safe plans. We also demonstrate that RoboGuard is resource-efficient, robust against adaptive attacks, and significantly enhanced by enabling its root-of-trust LLM to perform CoT reasoning. These results underscore the potential of RoboGuard to mitigate the safety risks and enhance the reliability of LLM-enabled robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closed Loop Interactive Embodied Reasoning for Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15194v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied reasoning systems integrate robotic hardware and cognitive processes to perform complex tasks, typically in response to a natural language query about a specific physical environment. This usually involves changing the belief about the scene or physically interacting and changing the scene (e.g. sort the objects from lightest to heaviest). In order to facilitate the development of such systems we introduce a new modular Closed Loop Interactive Embodied Reasoning (CLIER) approach that takes into account the measurements of non-visual object properties, changes in the scene caused by external disturbances as well as uncertain outcomes of robotic actions. CLIER performs multi-modal reasoning and action planning and generates a sequence of primitive actions that can be executed by a robot manipulator. Our method operates in a closed loop, responding to changes in the environment. Our approach is developed with the use of MuBle simulation environment and tested in 10 interactive benchmark scenarios. We extensively evaluate our reasoning approach in simulation and in real-world manipulation tasks with a success rate above 76% and 64%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025.

In collaboration with the LEGO Group, we developed Robert Robot, a simplified robot, which enables socialization between children and facilitates shared experiences when meeting for the first time. An exploratory study to observe socialization between preschool children was conducted with 30 respondents in pairs. Additionally, observational data from 212 play sessions with four Robert Robots in the wild were collected. Subsequent analysis found that children have fun as Robert Robot breaks the ice between unfamiliar children. The children relayed audio cues related to the imaginative world of Robert Robot's personalities and mimicked each other as a method of initiating social play and communication with their unfamiliar peers. Furthermore, the study contributes four implications for the design of robots for socialization between children. This chapter provides an example case of serious storytelling using playful interactions engaging children with the character of the robot and the mini-narratives around the build requests.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, accepted for inclusion in forthcoming book</p></details> |

However, existing approaches heavily focus on learning from passive human demonstration data for its simplicity in data collection. Interactive human teaching has appealing theoretical and practical properties, but they are not well supported by existing human-robot interfaces. This paper proposes a novel system that enables seamless control switching between human and an autonomous policy for bi-manual manipulation tasks, enabling more efficient learning of new tasks. This is achieved through a compliant, bilateral teleoperation system. Through simulation and hardware experiments, we demonstrate the value of our system in an interactive human teaching for learning complex bi-manual manipulation skills.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Symmetries of Swarms of Mobile Robots Using Equivariant Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07576v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we investigate symmetry properties of distributed systems of mobile robots. We consider a swarm of $n\in\mathbb{N}$ robots in the $\mathcal{OBLOT}$ model and analyze their collective $\mathcal{F}$sync dynamics using of equivariant dynamical systems theory. To this end, we show that the corresponding evolution function commutes with rotational and reflective transformations of $\mathbb{R}^2$. These form a group that is isomorphic to $\mathbf{O}(2) \times S_n$, the product group of the orthogonal group and the permutation on $n$ elements. The theory of equivariant dynamical systems is used to deduce a hierarchy along which symmetries of a robot swarm can potentially increase following an arbitrary protocol. By decoupling the Look phase from the Compute and Move phases in the mathematical description of an LCM cycle, this hierarchy can be characterized in terms of automorphisms of connectivity graphs. In particular, we find all possible types of symmetry increase, if the decoupled Compute and Move phase is invertible. Finally, we apply our results to protocols which induce state-dependent linear dynamics, where the reduced system consisting of only the Compute and Move phase is linear.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 Figures |

| **[Bi-Directional Mental Model Reconciliation for Human-Robot Interaction with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07547v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In human-robot interactions, human and robot agents maintain internal mental models of their environment, their shared task, and each other. The accuracy of these representations depends on each agent's ability to perform theory of mind, i.e. to understand the knowledge, preferences, and intentions of their teammate. When mental models diverge to the extent that it affects task execution, reconciliation becomes necessary to prevent the degradation of interaction. We propose a framework for bi-directional mental model reconciliation, leveraging large language models to facilitate alignment through semi-structured natural language dialogue. Our framework relaxes the assumption of prior model reconciliation work that either the human or robot agent begins with a correct model for the other agent to align to. Through our framework, both humans and robots are able to identify and communicate missing task-relevant context during interaction, iteratively progressing toward a shared mental model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Advan...</summary><p>Advancing Artificial Intelligence through Theory of Mind Workshop at AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Maintaining Plasticity in Reinforcement Learning: A Cost-Aware Framework for Aerial Robot Control in Non-stationary Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00282v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated the ability to maintain the plasticity of the policy throughout short-term training in aerial robot control. However, these policies have been shown to loss of plasticity when extended to long-term learning in non-stationary environments. For example, the standard proximal policy optimization (PPO) policy is observed to collapse in long-term training settings and lead to significant control performance degradation. To address this problem, this work proposes a cost-aware framework that uses a retrospective cost mechanism (RECOM) to balance rewards and losses in RL training with a non-stationary environment. Using a cost gradient relation between rewards and losses, our framework dynamically updates the learning rate to actively train the control policy in a disturbed wind environment. Our experimental results show that our framework learned a policy for the hovering task without policy collapse in variable wind conditions and has a successful result of 11.29% less dormant units than L2 regularization with PPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demonstration-Enhanced Adaptive Multi-Objective Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04857v4)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-aligned robot navigation in human environments is typically achieved through learning-based approaches, utilizing user feedback or demonstrations for personalization. However, personal preferences are subject to change and might even be context-dependent. Yet traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches with static reward functions often fall short in adapting to varying user preferences, inevitably reflecting demonstrations once training is completed. This paper introduces a structured framework that combines demonstration-based learning with multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL). To ensure real-world applicability, our approach allows for dynamic adaptation of the robot navigation policy to changing user preferences without retraining. It fluently modulates the amount of demonstration data reflection and other preference-related objectives. Through rigorous evaluations, including a baseline comparison and sim-to-real transfer on two robots, we demonstrate our framework's capability to adapt to user preferences accurately while achieving high navigational performance in terms of collision avoidance and goal pursuance.</p></details> |  |
