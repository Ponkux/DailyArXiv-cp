| **[Embodied-R1: Reinforced Embodied Reasoning for General Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13998v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Embod...</summary><p>Embodied-R1 technical report</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Data Storage and Retrieval for Embodied AI: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13901v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI (EAI) agents continuously interact with the physical world, generating vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams that traditional management systems are ill-equipped to handle. In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v5)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |
| **[Switch4EAI: Leveraging Console Game Platform for Benchmarking Robotic Athletics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13444v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in whole-body robot control have enabled humanoid and legged robots to execute increasingly agile and coordinated movements. However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We present Switch4EAI(Switch-for-Embodied-AI), a low-cost and easily deployable pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games to evaluate whole-body robot control policies. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future work to for benchmarking embodied AI.</p></details> | Workshop Submission |
| **[Virtuous Machines: Towards Artificial General Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13421v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness, executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments, accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored. It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and the attribution of scientific credit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large VLM-based Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13073v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide a regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation</p></details> |
| **[Embodied Image Quality Assessment for Robotic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18774v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of User-Generated Content (UGC) is a critical technique for human Quality of Experience (QoE). However, does the the image quality of Robot-Generated Content (RGC) demonstrate traits consistent with the Moravec paradox, potentially conflicting with human perceptual norms? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the perception mechanism of embodied robots for image quality. We propose the first Embodied Preference Database (EPD), which contains 12,500 distorted image annotations. We establish assessment metrics based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, there is a gap between UGC and RGC. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-scale Attention Embodied Image Quality Assessment called MA-EIQA. For the proposed EPD dataset, this is the first no-reference IQA model designed for embodied robot. Finally, the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[FormCoach: Lift Smarter, Not Harder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07501v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Good form is the difference between strength and strain, yet for the fast-growing community of at-home fitness enthusiasts, expert feedback is often out of reach. FormCoach transforms a simple camera into an always-on, interactive AI training partner, capable of spotting subtle form errors and delivering tailored corrections in real time, leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Affordance-Aware Robotic Dexterous Grasping with Human-like Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08896v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage, a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects, unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Large Model Empowered Embodied AI: A Survey on Decision-Making and Embodied Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10399v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI aims to develop intelligent systems with physical forms capable of perceiving, decision-making, acting, and learning in real-world environments, providing a promising way to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open dynamic environments. Recent breakthroughs in large models have revolutionized embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms, detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution, and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved, challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey, potentially as the further research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[JRDB-Reasoning: A Difficulty-Graded Benchmark for Visual Reasoning in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10287v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoSE: Skill-by-Skill Mixture-of-Experts Learning for Embodied Autonomous Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07818v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet the growing demand for smarter, faster, and more efficient embodied AI solutions, we introduce a novel Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) method that significantly boosts reasoning and learning efficiency for embodied autonomous systems. General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization, which limits their applicability in embodied AI such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose a skill-oriented MoE called MoSE, which mimics the human learning and reasoning process skill-by-skill, step-by-step. We introduce a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. To better align with multi-step planning in human reasoning and in end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike other multi-round dialogues, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g. perception-prediction-planning for AD, and high-level and low-level planning for robots) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model effectively grows more diverse expertise and outperforms models on both AD corner-case reasoning tasks and robot reasoning tasks with less than 40% of the parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[UnrealZoo: Enriching Photo-realistic Virtual Worlds for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20977v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce UnrealZoo, a collection of over 100 photo-realistic 3D virtual worlds built on Unreal Engine, designed to reflect the complexity and variability of open-world environments. We also provide a rich variety of playable entities, including humans, animals, robots, and vehicles for embodied AI research. We extend UnrealCV with optimized APIs and tools for data collection, environment augmentation, distributed training, and benchmarking. These improvements achieve significant improvements in the efficiency of rendering and communication, enabling advanced applications such as multi-agent interactions. Our experimental evaluation across visual navigation and tracking tasks reveals two key insights: 1) environmental diversity provides substantial benefits for developing generalizable reinforcement learning (RL) agents, and 2) current embodied agents face persistent challenges in open-world scenarios, including navigation in unstructured terrain, adaptation to unseen morphologies, and managing latency in the close-loop control systems for interacting in highly dynamic objects. UnrealZoo thus serves as both a comprehensive testing ground and a pathway toward developing more capable embodied AI systems for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight), Project page: http://unrealzoo.site/</p></details> |
| **[DiffPhysCam: Differentiable Physics-Based Camera Simulation for Inverse Rendering and Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08831v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DiffPhysCam, a differentiable camera simulator designed to support robotics and embodied AI applications by enabling gradient-based optimization in visual perception pipelines. Generating synthetic images that closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins, facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using images generated by DiffPhysCam.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 17 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[MEReQ: Max-Ent Residual-Q Inverse RL for Sample-Efficient Alignment from Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16258v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning robot behavior with human preferences is crucial for deploying embodied AI agents in human-centered environments. A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

This task requires the model to identify newly described objects that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that 3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.

| **[Semantic Mapping in Indoor Embodied AI -- A Survey on Advances, Challenges, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05750v3)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent embodied agents (e.g. robots) need to perform complex semantic tasks in unfamiliar environments. Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PANAMA: A Network-Aware MARL Framework for Multi-Agent Path Finding in Digital Twin Ecosystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06767v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Twins (DTs) are transforming industries through advanced data processing and analysis, positioning the world of DTs, Digital World, as a cornerstone of nextgeneration technologies including embodied AI. As robotics and automated systems scale, efficient data-sharing frameworks and robust algorithms become critical. We explore the pivotal role of data handling in next-gen networks, focusing on dynamics between application and network providers (AP/NP) in DT ecosystems. We introduce PANAMA, a novel algorithm with Priority Asymmetry for Network Aware Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based multi-agent path finding (MAPF). By adopting a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework and asynchronous actor-learner architectures, PANAMA accelerates training while enabling autonomous task execution by embodied AI. Our approach demonstrates superior pathfinding performance in accuracy, speed, and scalability compared to existing benchmarks. Through simulations, we highlight optimized data-sharing strategies for scalable, automated systems, ensuring resilience in complex, real-world environments. PANAMA bridges the gap between network-aware decision-making and robust multi-agent coordination, advancing the synergy between DTs, wireless networks, and AI-driven automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety of Embodied Navigation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05855v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention, particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety and increasing industrial efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniEAR: Benchmarking Agent Reasoning in Embodied Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05614v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to 56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically (0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/OmniEmbodied Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/OmniEmbodied</p></details> |
| **[CleanUpBench: Embodied Sweeping and Grasping Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05543v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI benchmarks have advanced navigation, manipulation, and reasoning, but most target complex humanoid agents or large-scale simulations that are far from real-world deployment. In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentSense: Virtual Sensor Data Generation Using LLM Agents in Simulated Home Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11773v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems. Code and data are released under [this https URL](https://github.com/AI45Lab/IS-Bench).</p></details> |  |

It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents. The code, checkpoint and benchmark are available at https://superrobobrain.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstructing 4D Spatial Intelligence: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21045v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date project page: https://github.com/yukangcao/Awesome-4D-Spatial-Intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yukangcao/Awesome-4D-Spatial-Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Exploring 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Activity Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D task planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advances in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the RoboTron-Craft, a stage-divided and cost-effective pipeline for realistic manipulation generation. Base on this, the RoboTron-Platter method is introduced, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.

| **[Object Affordance Recognition and Grounding via Multi-scale Cross-modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01184v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification). Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance grounding and classification.</p></details> |  |

Addressing a gap in retail-specific sim environments for embodied agent training, Sari Sandbox features over 250 interactive grocery items across three store configurations, controlled via an API. It supports both virtual reality (VR) for human interaction and a vision language model (VLM)-powered embodied agent. We also introduce SariBench, a dataset of annotated human demonstrations across varied task difficulties.

| **[OpenFly: A Comprehensive Platform for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v6)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents by leveraging language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Exploring the Link Between Bayesian Inference and Embodied Intelligence: Toward Open Physical-World Embodied AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21589v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open physical-world embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Multifunctional physical reservoir computing in soft tensegrity robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21496v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be utilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical reservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully addressed to date.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 figures.

| **[MazeEval: A Benchmark for Testing Sequential Decision-Making in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20395v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.</p></details> |  |

While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive, expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types, combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation) generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive humanoid motion generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://rosielab.github.io/compas3d</p></details> |
| **[Advances in 4D Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14501v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative artificial intelligence has recently progressed from static image and video synthesis to 3D content generation, culminating in the emergence of 4D generation-the task of synthesizing temporally coherent dynamic 3D assets guided by user input. As a burgeoning research frontier, 4D generation enables richer interactive and immersive experiences, with applications ranging from digital humans to autonomous driving. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks a unified understanding of 4D representations, generative frameworks, basic paradigms, and the core technical challenges it faces. This survey provides a systematic and in-depth review of the 4D generation landscape. To comprehensively characterize 4D generation, we first categorize fundamental 4D representations and outline associated techniques for 4D generation. We then present an in-depth analysis of representative generative pipelines based on conditions and representation methods. Subsequently, we discuss how motion and geometry priors are integrated into 4D outputs to ensure spatio-temporal consistency under various control schemes. From an application perspective, this paper summarizes 4D generation tasks in areas such as dynamic object/scene generation, digital human synthesis, editable 4D content, and embodied AI. Furthermore, we summarize and multi-dimensionally compare four basic paradigms for 4D generation: End-to-End, Generated-Data-Based, Implicit-Distillation-Based, and Explicit-Supervision-Based. Concluding our analysis, we highlight five key challenges-consistency, controllability, diversity, efficiency, and fidelity-and contextualize these with current approaches.By distilling recent advances and outlining open problems, this work offers a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective to guide future research in 4D generation.</p></details> |  |

Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jasper0314-huang.github.io/thinkact-vla/</p></details> |
| **[Towards provable probabilistic safety for scalable embodied AI systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05171v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. Instead, empirical safety evaluation is employed as an alternative, but the absence of provable guarantees imposes significant limitations. To address these issues, we argue for a paradigm shift to provable probabilistic safety that integrates provable guarantees with progressive achievement toward a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance. The new paradigm better leverages statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability, and a well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for provable probabilistic safety, along with corresponding challenges and potential solutions. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, this Perspective offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  |

Hence, StreamFormer learns global semantics, temporal dynamics, and fine-grained spatial relationships simultaneously.

As they serve as the primary visual input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning. EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering (PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover, we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for on-device egomotion video reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \textbf{PhysX-3D}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research in generative physical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://physx-3d.github.io/</p></details> |

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization.

As a result, we are seeing similar advancements in embodied AI and robotics for control policy generation. Our review paper examines the integration of generative AI models with RL to advance robotics. Our primary focus is on the duality between generative AI and RL for robotics downstream tasks. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The role of prominent generative AI tools as modular priors for multi-modal input fusion in RL tasks. (2) How RL can train, fine-tune and distill generative models for policy generation, such as VLA models, similarly to RL applications in large language models. We then propose a new taxonomy based on a considerable amount of selected papers. Lastly, we identify open challenges accounting for model scalability, adaptation and grounding, giving recommendations and insights on future research directions. We reflect on which generative AI models best fit the RL tasks and why. On the other side, we reflect on important issues inherent to RL-enhanced generative policies, such as safety concerns and failure modes, and what are the limitations of current methods. A curated collection of relevant research papers is maintained on our GitHub repository, serving as a resource for ongoing research and development in this field: https://github.com/clmoro/Robotics-RL-FMs-Integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication to Information Fusion</p></details> |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.

Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems.

| **[View Invariant Learning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08831v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training method.</p></details> | Under review |

However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Reasoning for Embodied Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22050v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Long-term Point Tracking in the Foundation Model Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09217v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However, real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets, offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines. However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time. Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks, demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.18487</p></details> |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models.

| **[SURPRISE3D: A Dataset for Spatial Understanding and Reasoning in Complex 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07781v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world. Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research. Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite. S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic planning.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoramic images, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 48 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing SOTA TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |
| **[A Neural Representation Framework with LLM-Driven Spatial Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06719v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical feature field. This field represents language and instance features using distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations, outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their spatial reasoning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated asset generation.

With PAPRLE, a user can change the arrangement of the robotic limbs, and control them using a variety of input devices, including puppeteers, gaming controllers, and VR-based interfaces. This versatility supports a wide range of teleoperation scenarios and promotes adaptability to different task requirements. To further enhance configurability, we introduce a pluggable puppeteer device that can be easily mounted and adapted to match the target robot configurations. PAPRLE supports bilateral teleoperation through these puppeteer devices, agnostic to the type or configuration of the follower robot. By supporting both joint-space and task-space control, the system provides real-time force feedback, improving user fidelity and physical interaction awareness. The modular design of PAPRLE facilitates novel spatial arrangements of the limbs and enables scalable data collection, thereby advancing research in embodied AI and learning-based control. We validate PAPRLE in various real-world settings, demonstrating its versatility across diverse combinations of leader devices and follower robots. The system will be released as open source, including both hardware and software components, to support broader adoption and community-driven extension.

However, collecting such embodied data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner, a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap. It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74% compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by 89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning.

These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices, and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings, which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents, allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical world.

However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks, demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://t2-vlm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in robotic reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection, while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment, which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic 3D Scene Generation with Spatially Contextualized VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20129v3)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

While single-arm systems have shown strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025. Built on the RoboTwin Simulation platform (1.0 and 2.0) and the AgileX COBOT-Magic Robot platform, the competition consisted of three stages: Simulation Round 1, Simulation Round 2, and a final Real-World Round. Participants totally tackled 17 dual-arm manipulation tasks, covering rigid, deformable, and tactile-based scenarios. The challenge attracted 64 global teams and over 400 participants, producing top-performing solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3 and generating valuable insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning. This report outlines the competition setup, task design, evaluation methodology, key findings and future direction, aiming to support future research on robust and generalizable bimanual manipulation policies.

Existing techniques generatively re-render the input video to realize the transfer, such as video relighting models and conditioned world generation models. Nevertheless, these models are predominantly limited to the domain of training data (e.g., portrait) or fall into the bottleneck of temporal consistency and computation efficiency, especially when the input video involves complex dynamics and long durations. In this paper, we propose TC-Light, a novel generative renderer to overcome these problems. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark. Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible re-rendering results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking, space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings, leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend. We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.</p></details> |  |

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets and algorithms approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered in the research field. In this work, we address this shortcoming by introducing: (1) Articulate3D, an expertly curated 3D dataset featuring high-quality manual annotations on 280 indoor scenes. Articulate3D provides 8 types of annotations for articulated objects, covering parts and detailed motion information, all stored in a standardized scene representation format designed for scalable 3D content creation, exchange and seamless integration into simulation environments. (2) USDNet, a novel unified framework capable of simultaneously predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes for articulated objects. We evaluate USDNet on Articulate3D as well as two existing datasets, demonstrating the advantage of our unified dense prediction approach. Furthermore, we highlight the value of Articulate3D through cross-dataset and cross-domain evaluations and showcase its applicability in downstream tasks such as scene editing through LLM prompting and robotic policy training for articulated object manipulation. We provide open access to our dataset, benchmark, and method's source code.</p></details> |  |

As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art.

Current language model-based navigation systems operate on discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient, reward-driven post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: vlnr1.github.io</p></details> |
| **[From 2D to 3D Cognition: A Brief Survey of General World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20134v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models have garnered increasing attention in the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), serving as computational frameworks for learning representations of the external world and forecasting future states. While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent 3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward 3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing 3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in 3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning, and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing more robust and generalizable 3D world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Multi-sensor Fusion Perception for Embodied AI: Background, Methods, Challenges and Prospects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19769v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI, which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion, while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods. A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

The recent rise of AI scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning, and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration, and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven science.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting 19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks. We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs in practical applications such as robotics and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable, semantics-aware evaluator for world models.</p></details> |  |

Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in simulation platforms have greatly enhanced task diversity to train embodied Vision Language Models (VLMs), most platforms rely on simplified robot morphologies and bypass the stochastic nature of low-level execution, which limits their transferability to real-world robots. To address these issues, we present a physics-based simulation platform DualTHOR for complex dual-arm humanoid robots, built upon an extended version of AI2-THOR. Our simulator includes real-world robot assets, a task suite for dual-arm collaboration, and inverse kinematics solvers for humanoid robots. We also introduce a contingency mechanism that incorporates potential failures through physics-based low-level execution, bridging the gap to real-world scenarios. Our simulator enables a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness and generalization of VLMs in household environments. Extensive evaluations reveal that current VLMs struggle with dual-arm coordination and exhibit limited robustness in realistic environments with contingencies, highlighting the importance of using our simulator to develop more capable VLMs for embodied tasks.

Across diverse settings within Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality, introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

Despite the progress made by existing methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results, their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning (WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their capabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and deformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the lack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under diverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for generating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac features a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional tactile sensors \sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip detection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips. Furthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis pipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based on this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm robotic system. Experiments demonstrate that PP-Tac can effectively grasp paper-like objects of varying material, thickness, and stiffness, achieving an overall success rate of 87.5\%.

The diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI. However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which suffer from high production costs and limited realism.

Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy-action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle action-related and distracting dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW).

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025, Poster, Project Page: https://laom.dunnolab.ai/, Source code: https://github.com/dunnolab/laom</p></details> |

Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[OctoNav: Towards Generalist Embodied Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09839v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents, which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1. Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1, we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e., Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically, we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability. Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Analytic Task Scheduler: Recursive Least Squares Based Method for Continual Learning in Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09623v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied foundation models are crucial for Artificial Intelligence (AI) interacting with the physical world by integrating multi-modal inputs, such as proprioception, vision and language, to understand human intentions and generate actions to control robots. While these models demonstrate strong generalization and few-shot learning capabilities, they face significant challenges in continually acquiring new skills without forgetting previously learned skills, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for continual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a task-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a single task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares (RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific models. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model selection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The scheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics (autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant learning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a real-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to forgetting and strong adaptability to task variations. The results highlight ATS as an effective, scalable, and deployable solution for continual learning in embodied foundation models operating in complex, dynamic environments. Our code will be available at https://github.com/MIAA-Embodied-AI/AnalyticTaskScheduler</p></details> |  |
| **[What Can RL Bring to VLA Generalization? An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://faceong.github.io/VIKI-R/</p></details> |
| **[Generalizable Articulated Object Reconstruction from Casually Captured RGBD Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08334v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Understanding their kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$ larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos, outperforming existing methods significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website can be found at https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/video2articulation/</p></details> |

We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance embodied agent training.

Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

| **[LLM-driven Indoor Scene Layout Generation via Scaled Human-aligned Data Synthesis and Multi-Stage Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07570v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches such as Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes. Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such as drones and mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025 Embodied AI Workshop</p></details> |

ComputerRL features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%, demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop automation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et al., 2024a)</p></details> |  |

Recent work has suggested that DP-FL may be enhanced or outperformed by methods that use DP synthetic data (Wu et al., 2024; Hou et al., 2024). The primary algorithms for generating DP synthetic data for FL applications require careful prompt engineering based on public information and/or iterative private client feedback. Our key insight is that the private client feedback collected by prior DP synthetic data methods (Hou et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024) can be viewed as an RL (reinforcement learning) reward. Our algorithm, Policy Optimization for Private Data (POPri) harnesses client feedback using policy optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune LLMs to generate high-quality DP synthetic data. To evaluate POPri, we release LargeFedBench, a new federated text benchmark for uncontaminated LLM evaluations on federated client data. POPri substantially improves the utility of DP synthetic data relative to prior work on LargeFedBench datasets and an existing benchmark from Xie et al. (2024). POPri closes the gap between next-token prediction accuracy in the fully-private and non-private settings by up to 58%, compared to 28% for prior synthetic data methods, and 3% for state-of-the-art DP federated learning methods.

However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations, we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS) strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of SvS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Preferences and Mixed Demonstrations in General Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14027v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale. We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable. Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.</p></details> |  |

Each plan includes precise annotations of architectural elements (walls, doors, windows, balconies) and functional spaces (such as kitchens, bedrooms, and bathrooms). ResPlan addresses key limitations of existing datasets such as RPLAN (Wu et al., 2019) and MSD (van Engelenburg et al., 2024) by offering enhanced visual fidelity and greater structural diversity, reflecting realistic and non-idealized residential layouts. Designed as a versatile, general-purpose resource, ResPlan supports a wide range of applications including robotics, reinforcement learning, generative AI, virtual and augmented reality, simulations, and game development. Plans are provided in both geometric and graph-based formats, enabling direct integration into simulation engines and fast 3D conversion. A key contribution is an open-source pipeline for geometry cleaning, alignment, and annotation refinement. Additionally, ResPlan includes structured representations of room connectivity, supporting graph-based spatial reasoning tasks. Finally, we present comparative analyses with existing benchmarks and outline several open benchmark tasks enabled by ResPlan. Ultimately, ResPlan offers a significant advance in scale, realism, and usability, providing a robust foundation for developing and benchmarking next-generation spatial intelligence systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization (RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML2025 (spotlight)</p></details> |

We further observe reliable performance of our function approximation algorithm compared to other algorithms in the function approximation setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite Expression Method for Solving High-Dimensional Partial Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10121v4)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing efficient and accurate numerical solvers for high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a challenging and important topic in computational science and engineering, mainly due to the "curse of dimensionality" in designing numerical schemes that scale in dimension. This paper introduces a new methodology that seeks an approximate PDE solution in the space of functions with finitely many analytic expressions and, hence, this methodology is named the finite expression method (FEX). It is proved in approximation theory that FEX can avoid the curse of dimensionality. As a proof of concept, a deep reinforcement learning method is proposed to implement FEX for various high-dimensional PDEs in different dimensions, achieving high and even machine accuracy with a memory complexity polynomial in dimension and an amenable time complexity. An approximate solution with finite analytic expressions also provides interpretable insights into the ground truth PDE solution, which can further help to advance the understanding of physical systems and design postprocessing techniques for a refined solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Categorical Policies: Multimodal Policy Learning and Exploration in Continuous Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13922v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone, limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures; Has been submitted and accepted at IEEE SMC, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Diffusion Q-Learning: From Iterative Denoising to One-Step Action Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13904v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning (RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time compared to DQL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Deployable Multi-Robot Collaboration via a Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13877v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer (GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable, and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks. We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.</p></details> |  |

This motivates self-sustainable IoT ecosystems based on Energy Harvesting (EH). This paper treats IoT deployments in which IoT devices (IoTDs) rely solely on EH to sense and transmit information about events/alarms to a base station (BS). The objective is to effectively manage the duty cycling of the IoTDs to prolong battery life and maximize the relevant data sent to the BS. The BS can also wake up specific IoTDs if extra information about an event is needed upon initial detection. We propose a K-nearest neighbors (KNN)-based duty cycling management to optimize energy efficiency and detection accuracy by considering spatial correlations among IoTDs' activity and their EH process. We evaluate machine learning approaches, including reinforcement learning (RL) and decision transformers (DT), to maximize information captured from events while managing energy consumption. Significant improvements over the state-ofthe-art approaches are obtained in terms of energy saving by all three proposals, KNN, RL, and DT. Moreover, the RL-based solution approaches the performance of a genie-aided benchmark as the number of IoTDs increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been partially supported by the Research Council of Finland (Grant 369116 (6G Flagship Programme), Grant 362782), the Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion, the European Commission through the Horizon Europe/JU SNS project AMBIENT-6G (Grant 101192113), and in Chile, by ANID FONDECYT Regular No.1241977</p></details> |

| **[Dual-Head Physics-Informed Graph Decision Transformer for Distribution System Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06634v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by recent advances in sensing and computing, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technologies have shown great potential for addressing distribution system restoration (DSR) under uncertainty. However, their data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit their ability to handle scenarios that require long-term temporal dependencies or few-shot and zero-shot decision making. Emerging Decision Transformers (DTs), which leverage causal transformers for sequence modeling in DRL tasks, offer a promising alternative. However, their reliance on return-to-go (RTG) cloning and limited generalization capacity restricts their effectiveness in dynamic power system environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative Dual-Head Physics-informed Graph Decision Transformer (DH-PGDT) that integrates physical modeling, structural reasoning, and subgoal-based guidance to enable scalable and robust DSR even in zero-shot or few-shot scenarios. DH-PGDT features a dual-head physics-informed causal transformer architecture comprising Guidance Head, which generates subgoal representations, and Action Head, which uses these subgoals to generate actions independently of RTG. It also incorporates an operational constraint-aware graph reasoning module that encodes power system topology and operational constraints to generate a confidence-weighted action vector for refining DT trajectories. This design effectively improves generalization and enables robust adaptation to unseen scenarios. While this work focuses on DSR, the underlying computing model of the proposed PGDT is broadly applicable to sequential decision making across various power system operations and other complex engineering domains.</p></details> |  |

| **[Scaling Up without Fading Out: Goal-Aware Sparse GNN for RL-based Generalized Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10747v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow, especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale generalized planning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement learning for robust dynamic metabolic control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00735v4)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic metabolic control allows key metabolic fluxes to be modulated in real time, enhancing bioprocess flexibility and expanding available optimization degrees of freedom. This is achieved, e.g., via targeted modulation of metabolic enzyme expression. However, identifying optimal dynamic control policies is challenging due to the generally high-dimensional solution space and the need to manage metabolic burden and cytotoxic effects arising from inducible enzyme expression. The task is further complicated by stochastic dynamics, which reduce bioprocess reproducibility. We propose a reinforcement learning framework} to derive optimal policies by allowing an agent (the controller) to interact with a surrogate dynamic model. To promote robustness, we apply domain randomization, enabling the controller to generalize across uncertainties. When transferred to an experimental system, the agent can in principle continue fine-tuning the policy. Our framework provides an alternative to conventional model-based control such as model predictive control, which requires model differentiation with respect to decision variables; often impractical for complex stochastic, nonlinear, stiff, and piecewise-defined dynamics. In contrast, our approach relies on forward integration of the model, thereby simplifying the task. We demonstrate the framework in two $\textit{Escherichia coli}$ bioprocesses: dynamic control of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for fatty-acid synthesis and of adenosine triphosphatase for lactate synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depth-Breadth Synergy in RLVR: Unlocking LLM Reasoning Gains with Adaptive Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13755v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions: Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR.</p></details> | 11pages, 9 figures |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances access to external information, yet remains limited in multi-hop reasoning and strategic search due to rigid workflows. Recent advancements in agentic deep research empower LLMs to autonomously reason, search, and synthesize information. However, current approaches relying on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) face critical issues such as conflicting gradients and reward sparsity, limiting performance gains and training efficiency. To address these, we first propose Atomic Thought, a novel LLM thinking paradigm that decomposes reasoning into fine-grained functional units. These units are supervised by Reasoning Reward Models (RRMs), which provide Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR) for fine-grained guidance. Building on this, we propose Atom-Searcher, a novel RL framework for agentic deep research that integrates Atomic Thought and ATR. Atom-Searcher uses a curriculum-inspired reward schedule, prioritizing process-level ATR early and transitioning to outcome rewards, accelerating convergence on effective reasoning paths. Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art. Key advantages include: (1) Atom-Searcher scales computation at test-time. (2) Atomic Thought provides supervision anchors for RRMs, bridging deep research tasks and RRMs. (3) Atom-Searcher exhibits more interpretable, human-like reasoning patterns.</p></details> |  |

To simultaneously support two groups of users energy receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs) without sacrificing time frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving ERs with the aid of a BDRIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A protective partial zero forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs to manage the non coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently, closed form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average sum of harvested energy at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power control, and scattering matrix design at the BDRIS, all based on long term statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub problems, efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power control design. Numerical results show that a BDRIS with a group or fully connected architecture achieves significant energy harvesting gains over the conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a seven fold increase in the average sum of harvested energy when a heuristic based scattering matrix design is employed.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is the journal version of the article arXiv:2402.00646v1</p></details> |
| **[CausalPlan: Empowering Efficient LLM Multi-Agent Collaboration Through Causality-Driven Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13721v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop, CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B. Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.</p></details> |  |

Distributing samples across nodes usually yields the best performance, but poses scaling challenges due to global information dissemination and load imbalance across uneven sample lengths. State-of-the-art decentralized optimizers mitigate the problem, but require more iterations to achieve the same accuracy as their globally-communicating counterparts. We present Wait-Avoiding Group Model Averaging (WAGMA) SGD, a wait-avoiding stochastic optimizer that reduces global communication via subgroup weight exchange. The key insight is a combination of algorithmic changes to the averaging scheme and the use of a group allreduce operation. We prove the convergence of WAGMA-SGD, and empirically show that it retains convergence rates similar to Allreduce-SGD. For evaluation, we train ResNet-50 on ImageNet; Transformer for machine translation; and deep reinforcement learning for navigation at scale. Compared with state-of-the-art decentralized SGD variants, WAGMA-SGD significantly improves training throughput (e.g., 2.1x on 1,024 GPUs for reinforcement learning), and achieves the fastest time-to-solution (e.g., the highest score using the shortest training time for Transformer).</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (IEEE TPDS), vol. 32, no. 7, pp. 1725-1739, 1 July 2021</p></details> |

However, existing communication protocols in MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents. Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We consider a variant of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) as a case study for our method. Through a set of experiments where our method is compared against a Dynamic Programming (DP)-based heuristic for solving the PP, we show that our method solves the linear relaxation up to a reasonable objective gap in significantly shorter running times.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables, Journal Submission</p></details> |

Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient, highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date, containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau, improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced closed-source models.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[Toward Better EHR Reasoning in LLMs: Reinforcement Learning with Expert Attention Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13579v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR) reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been available at https://github.com/devilran6/EAG-RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving DAPO from a Mixed-Policy Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12931v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm [1], approached from a mixed-policy perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this, we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size. Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods, demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance. Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The platform will be released open-source on GitHub: https://github.com/BuildNexusX/MuFlex once pre-printed</p></details> |

While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG) reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1) SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2) SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing robustly to out-of-domain cases.</p></details> |  |

A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, its efficiency remains a challenge due to the generation of excessive intermediate reasoning tokens, which introduce semantic redundancy and overly detailed reasoning steps. Moreover, computational expense and latency are significant concerns, as the cost scales with the number of output tokens, including those intermediate steps. In this work, we observe that most CoT tokens are unnecessary, and retaining only a small portion of them is sufficient for producing high-quality responses. Inspired by this, we propose HAWKEYE, a novel post-training and inference framework where a large model produces concise CoT instructions to guide a smaller model in response generation. HAWKEYE quantifies redundancy in CoT reasoning and distills high-density information via reinforcement learning. By leveraging these concise CoTs, HAWKEYE is able to expand responses while reducing token usage and computational cost significantly. Our evaluation shows that HAWKEYE can achieve comparable response quality using only 35% of the full CoTs, while improving clarity, coherence, and conciseness by approximately 10%. Furthermore, HAWKEYE can accelerate end-to-end reasoning by up to 3.4x on complex math tasks while reducing inference cost by up to 60%. HAWKEYE will be open-sourced and the models will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

However, existing legal LLMs still struggle to generate reliable and interpretable reasoning processes. They often default to fast-thinking behavior by producing direct answers without explicit multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in complex legal scenarios that demand rigorous justification. To address this challenge, we propose Legal$\Delta$, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance legal reasoning through chain-of-thought guided information gain. During training, Legal$\Delta$ employs a dual-mode input setup-comprising direct answer and reasoning-augmented modes-and maximizes the information gain between them. This encourages the model to acquire meaningful reasoning patterns rather than generating superficial or redundant explanations. Legal$\Delta$ follows a two-stage approach: (1) distilling latent reasoning capabilities from a powerful Large Reasoning Model (LRM), DeepSeek-R1, and (2) refining reasoning quality via differential comparisons, combined with a multidimensional reward mechanism that assesses both structural coherence and legal-domain specificity. Experimental results on multiple legal reasoning tasks demonstrate that Legal$\Delta$ outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and interpretability. It consistently produces more robust and trustworthy legal judgments without relying on labeled preference data. All code and data will be released at https://github.com/NEUIR/LegalDelta.</p></details> |  |

Previous attempts, including pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50 diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1 obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully. Our implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/PKU-ML/G1, with models and datasets hosted on Hugging Face collections https://huggingface.co/collections/PKU-ML/g1-683d659e992794fc99618cf2 for broader accessibility.</p></details> |  |

Various AI techniques have been explored to develop autonomous agents capable of trading financial assets. These approaches encompass traditional methods such as neural networks, fuzzy logic, and reinforcement learning, as well as more recent advancements, including deep neural networks and deep reinforcement learning. Many developers report success in creating strategies that exhibit strong performance during simulations using historical price data, a process commonly referred to as backtesting. However, when these strategies are deployed in real markets, their performance often deteriorates, particularly in terms of risk-adjusted returns. In this study, we propose an AI-based strategy inspired by a classical investment paradigm: Value Investing. Financial AI models are highly susceptible to lookahead bias and other forms of bias that can significantly inflate performance in backtesting compared to live trading conditions. To address this issue, we conducted a series of computational simulations while controlling for these biases, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. Our results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms major Brazilian market benchmarks. Moreover, the strategy, named AlphaX, demonstrated superior performance relative to widely used technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI), with statistically significant results. Finally, we discuss several open challenges and highlight emerging technologies in qualitative analysis that may contribute to the development of a comprehensive AI-based Value Investing framework in the future</p></details> | 6 pages |

Whilst there is work on achieving tractable policies for experimental design problems, there is significantly less work on obtaining policies that are able to generalise well - i.e. able to give good performance despite a change in the underlying statistical properties of the experiments. Conducting experiments sequentially has recently brought about the use of reinforcement learning, where an agent is trained to navigate the design space to select the most informative designs for experimentation. However, there is still a lack of understanding about the benefits and drawbacks of using certain reinforcement learning algorithms to train these agents. In our work, we investigate several reinforcement learning algorithms and their efficacy in producing agents that take maximally informative design decisions in sequential experimental design scenarios. We find that agent performance is impacted depending on the algorithm used for training, and that particular algorithms, using dropout or ensemble approaches, empirically showcase attractive generalisation properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 mai...</summary><p>7 main pages, 19 pages of appendices - paper accepted at the 8th Workshop on Generalization in Planning at AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Language-Guided Multi-Agent Learning in Simulations: A Unified Framework and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04251v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning in Multi-Goal Spatial Navigation with Autonomous Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18794v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is hypothesized to be able to leverage the inherent hierarchy in learning tasks where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) often fails. In this research, HRL is evaluated and contrasted with traditional RL in complex robotic navigation tasks. We evaluate unique characteristics of HRL, including its ability to create sub-goals and the termination functions. We constructed a number of experiments to test: 1) the differences between RL proximal policy optimization (PPO) and HRL, 2) different ways of creating sub-goals in HRL, 3) manual vs automatic sub-goal creation in HRL, and 4) the effects of the frequency of termination on performance in HRL. These experiments highlight the advantages of HRL over RL and how it achieves these advantages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Efficient Safe Policy Improvement Using Parametric Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15532v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe policy improvement (SPI) is an offline reinforcement learning problem in which a new policy that reliably outperforms the behavior policy with high confidence needs to be computed using only a dataset and the behavior policy. Markov decision processes (MDPs) are the standard formalism for modeling environments in SPI. In many applications, additional information in the form of parametric dependencies between distributions in the transition dynamics is available. We make SPI more data-efficient by leveraging these dependencies through three contributions: (1) a parametric SPI algorithm that exploits known correlations between distributions to more accurately estimate the transition dynamics using the same amount of data; (2) a preprocessing technique that prunes redundant actions from the environment through a game-based abstraction; and (3) a more advanced preprocessing technique, based on satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solving, that can identify more actions to prune. Empirical results and an ablation study show that our techniques increase the data efficiency of SPI by multiple orders of magnitude while maintaining the same reliability guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Manipulate-to-Navigate: Reinforcement Learning with Visual Affordances and Manipulability Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13151v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile manipulation in dynamic environments is challenging due to movable obstacles blocking the robot's path. Traditional methods, which treat navigation and manipulation as separate tasks, often fail in such 'manipulate-to-navigate' scenarios, as obstacles must be removed before navigation. In these cases, active interaction with the environment is required to clear obstacles while ensuring sufficient space for movement. To address the manipulate-to-navigate problem, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach for learning manipulation actions that facilitate subsequent navigation. Our method combines manipulability priors to focus the robot on high manipulability body positions with affordance maps for selecting high-quality manipulation actions. By focusing on feasible and meaningful actions, our approach reduces unnecessary exploration and allows the robot to learn manipulation strategies more effectively. We present two new manipulate-to-navigate simulation tasks called Reach and Door with the Boston Dynamics Spot robot. The first task tests whether the robot can select a good hand position in the target area such that the robot base can move effectively forward while keeping the end effector position fixed. The second task requires the robot to move a door aside in order to clear the navigation path. Both of these tasks need first manipulation and then navigating the base forward. Results show that our method allows a robot to effectively interact with and traverse dynamic environments. Finally, we transfer the learned policy to a real Boston Dynamics Spot robot, which successfully performs the Reach task.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDPO: Overcoming the Training-Inference Divide of Masked Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13148v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens, whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random. Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and 54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine tokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we refer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains when combined with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.

| **[Improving Detection of Watermarked Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13131v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking has recently emerged as an effective strategy for detecting the generations of large language models (LLMs). The strength of a watermark typically depends strongly on the entropy afforded by the language model and the set of input prompts. However, entropy can be quite limited in practice, especially for models that are post-trained, for example via instruction tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which makes detection based on watermarking alone challenging. In this work, we investigate whether detection can be improved by combining watermark detectors with non-watermark ones. We explore a number of hybrid schemes that combine the two, observing performance gains over either class of detector under a wide range of experimental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaRL: Learning Scalable Planning Policies with Simple Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17838v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate reinforcement learning (RL) for privileged planning in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based, but these methods do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is scalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning. Contemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum multiple individual rewards, \eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. We show that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the mini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches. Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single intuitive reward term: route completion. Infractions are penalized by terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion. We find that PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our simple reward, even improving performance. Training with large mini-batch sizes enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. We scale PPO to 300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The resulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark, outperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin. Requiring only minimal adaptations from its use in CARLA, the same method is the best learning-based approach on nuPlan. It scores 91.3 in non-reactive and 90.6 in reactive traffic on the Val14 benchmark while being an order of magnitude faster than prior work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Conference on Robot Learning 2025</p></details> |
| **[Large VLM-based Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13073v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

| **[Reinforced Context Order Recovery for Adaptive Reasoning and Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13070v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern causal language models, followed by rapid developments in discrete diffusion models, can now produce a wide variety of interesting and useful content. However, these families of models are predominantly trained to output tokens with a fixed (left-to-right) or random order, which may deviate from the logical order in which tokens are generated originally. In this paper, we observe that current causal and diffusion models encounter difficulties in problems that require adaptive token generation orders to solve tractably, which we characterize with the $\mathcal{V}$-information framework. Motivated by this, we propose Reinforced Context Order Recovery (ReCOR), a reinforcement-learning-based framework to extract adaptive, data-dependent token generation orders from text data without annotations. Self-supervised by token prediction statistics, ReCOR estimates the hardness of predicting every unfilled token and adaptively selects the next token during both training and inference. Experiments on challenging reasoning and planning datasets demonstrate the superior performance of ReCOR compared with baselines, sometimes outperforming oracle models supervised with the ground-truth order.</p></details> |  |

We investigate a contextual bandit version of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL), where models learn in-context, online, from external reward, instead of supervised data. We show that LLMs effectively demonstrate such learning, and provide a detailed study of the phenomena, experimenting with challenging classification tasks and models of sizes from 500M to 70B parameters. This includes identifying and addressing the instability of the process, demonstrating learning with both semantic and abstract labels, and showing scaling trends. Our findings highlight ICRL capabilities in LLMs, while also underscoring fundamental limitations in their implicit reasoning about errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLM 2025</p></details> |

Its success, however, largely depends on strong base models with rich world knowledge, yielding only modest improvements for small-size language models (SLMs). To address this limitation, we investigate Guided GRPO, which injects ground-truth reasoning steps into roll-out trajectories to compensate for SLMs' inherent weaknesses. Through a comprehensive study of various guidance configurations, we find that naively adding guidance delivers limited gains. These insights motivate G$^2$RPO-A, an adaptive algorithm that automatically adjusts guidance strength in response to the model's evolving training dynamics. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code-generation benchmarks confirm that G$^2$RPO-A substantially outperforms vanilla GRPO. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/T-Lab-CUHKSZ/G2RPO-A.</p></details> |  |
| **[An MRP Formulation for Supervised Learning: Generalized Temporal Difference Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15518v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traditional statistical learning, data points are usually assumed to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) following an unknown probability distribution. This paper presents a contrasting viewpoint, perceiving data points as interconnected and employing a Markov reward process (MRP) for data modeling. We reformulate the typical supervised learning as an on-policy policy evaluation problem within reinforcement learning (RL), introducing a generalized temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm as a resolution. Theoretically, our analysis establishes connections between the solutions of linear TD learning and ordinary least squares (OLS). Under specific conditions -- particularly when the noise is correlated -- the TD solution serves as a more effective estimator than OLS. Furthermore, we show that when our algorithm is applied with many commonly used loss functions -- such as those found in generalized linear models -- it corresponds to the application of a novel and generalized Bellman operator. We prove that this operator admits a unique fixed point, and based on this, we establish convergence guarantees for our generalized TD algorithm under linear function approximation. Empirical studies verify our theoretical results, examine the vital design of our TD algorithm and show practical utility across various datasets, encompassing tasks such as regression and image classification with deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by JAIR.

| **[Breaking Reward Collapse: Adaptive Reinforcement for Open-ended Medical Reasoning with Enhanced Semantic Discrimination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12957v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards has demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning and generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs), while reducing computational overhead. However, its application in medical imaging remains underexplored. Existing reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches in this domain primarily target closed-ended visual question answering (VQA), limiting their applicability to real-world clinical reasoning. In contrast, open-ended medical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited attention. While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via semantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often suffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic differences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive Reinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended medical VQA. ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning with textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning quality. We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks. Results show that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving a 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks. These results highlight the critical role of reward discriminability in medical RL and the promise of semantically guided rewards for enabling robust and clinically meaningful multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTPO and GRPO-S: Token and Sequence-Level Reward Shaping with Policy Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04349v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks. This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces OPTIC-ER, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for real-time, adaptive, and equitable emergency response. OPTIC-ER uses an attention-guided actor-critic architecture to manage the complexity of dispatch environments. Its key innovations are a Context-Rich State Vector, encoding action sub-optimality, and a Precision Reward Function, which penalizes inefficiency. Training occurs in a high-fidelity simulation using real data from Rivers State, Nigeria, accelerated by a precomputed Travel Time Atlas. The system is built on the TALS framework (Thin computing, Adaptability, Low-cost, Scalability) for deployment in low-resource settings. In evaluations on 500 unseen incidents, OPTIC-ER achieved a 100.00% optimality rate with negligible inefficiency, confirming its robustness and generalization. Beyond dispatch, the system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring Dashboards to guide proactive governance and data-informed development. This work presents a validated blueprint for AI-augmented public services, showing how context-aware RL can bridge the gap between algorithmic decision-making and measurable human impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code and data available at: https://github.com/marytonwe/OPTIC-ER.git</p></details> |
| **[Towards Open-Ended Emotional Support Conversations in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning with Future-Oriented Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12935v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) systems aim to alleviate users' emotional difficulties and provide long-term, systematic support for emotional well-being. However, most large language model (LLM)-based ESC systems rely on predefined strategies, which limits their effectiveness in complex, real-life scenarios. To enable flexible responses to diverse emotional problem scenarios, this paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework (RLFF-ESC) that directly learns enduring emotionally supportive response skills using reinforcement learning. For sustained emotional support, we first employ an LLM-based multi-agent mechanism to simulate future dialogue trajectories and collect future-oriented rewards. We then train a future-oriented reward model, which is subsequently used to train the emotional support policy model. Additionally, we incorporate an explicit reasoning process during response generation to further enhance the quality, relevance, and contextual appropriateness of the system's responses. We evaluate the backbone policy model on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct models, testing the proposed RLFF-ESC framework across two public ESC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RLFF-ESC consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of goal completion and response quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseMap: A Sparse Tensor Accelerator Framework Based on Evolution Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12906v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for sparse tensor algebra (SpTA) in machine learning and big data has driven the development of various sparse tensor accelerators. However, most existing manually designed accelerators are limited to specific scenarios, and it's time-consuming and challenging to adjust a large number of design factors when scenarios change. Therefore, automating the design of SpTA accelerators is crucial. Nevertheless, previous works focus solely on either mapping (i.e., tiling communication and computation in space and time) or sparse strategy (i.e., bypassing zero elements for efficiency), leading to suboptimal designs due to the lack of comprehensive consideration of both. A unified framework that jointly optimizes both is urgently needed. However, integrating mapping and sparse strategies leads to a combinatorial explosion in the design space(e.g., as large as $O(10^{41})$ for the workload $P_{32 \times 64} \times Q_{64 \times 48} = Z_{32 \times 48}$). This vast search space renders most conventional optimization methods (e.g., particle swarm optimization, reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search) inefficient. To address this challenge, we propose an evolution strategy-based sparse tensor accelerator optimization framework, called SparseMap. SparseMap constructing a more comprehensive design space with the consideration of both mapping and sparse strategy. We introduce a series of enhancements to genetic encoding and evolutionary operators, enabling SparseMap to efficiently explore the vast and diverse design space. We quantitatively compare SparseMap with prior works and classical optimization methods, demonstrating that SparseMap consistently finds superior solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[REACH: Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Allocation in Community and Heterogeneous Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12857v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Community GPU platforms are emerging as a cost-effective and democratized alternative to centralized GPU clusters for AI workloads, aggregating idle consumer GPUs from globally distributed and heterogeneous environments. However, their extreme hardware/software diversity, volatile availability, and variable network conditions render traditional schedulers ineffective, leading to suboptimal task completion. In this work, we present REACH (Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Allocation in Community and Heterogeneous Networks), a Transformer-based reinforcement learning framework that redefines task scheduling as a sequence scoring problem to balance performance, reliability, cost, and network efficiency. By modeling both global GPU states and task requirements, REACH learns to adaptively co-locate computation with data, prioritize critical jobs, and mitigate the impact of unreliable resources. Extensive simulation results show that REACH improves task completion rates by up to 17%, more than doubles the success rate for high-priority tasks, and reduces bandwidth penalties by over 80% compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Stress tests further demonstrate its robustness to GPU churn and network congestion, while scalability experiments confirm its effectiveness in large-scale, high-contention scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Econometrics and AI: VaR Estimation via Reinforcement Learning and GARCH Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16635v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an environment of increasingly volatile financial markets, the accurate estimation of risk remains a major challenge. Traditional econometric models, such as GARCH and its variants, are based on assumptions that are often too rigid to adapt to the complexity of the current market dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework for Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation, combining GARCH volatility models with deep reinforcement learning. Our approach incorporates directional market forecasting using the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) model, treating the task as an imbalanced classification problem. This architecture enables the dynamic adjustment of risk-level forecasts according to market conditions. Empirical validation on daily Eurostoxx 50 data covering periods of crisis and high volatility shows a significant improvement in the accuracy of VaR estimates, as well as a reduction in the number of breaches and also in capital requirements, while respecting regulatory risk thresholds. The ability of the model to adjust risk levels in real time reinforces its relevance to modern and proactive risk management.</p></details> |  |

While many MARL benchmarks have been proposed, few combine continuous state and action spaces with challenging coordination and planning tasks. We introduce CAMAR, a new MARL benchmark designed explicitly for multi-agent pathfinding in environments with continuous actions. CAMAR supports cooperative and competitive interactions between agents and runs efficiently at up to 100,000 environment steps per second. We also propose a three-tier evaluation protocol to better track algorithmic progress and enable deeper analysis of performance. In addition, CAMAR allows the integration of classical planning methods such as RRT and RRT* into MARL pipelines. We use them as standalone baselines and combine RRT* with popular MARL algorithms to create hybrid approaches. We provide a suite of test scenarios and benchmarking tools to ensure reproducibility and fair comparison. Experiments show that CAMAR presents a challenging and realistic testbed for the MARL community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning with Rubric Anchors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12790v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by the success of OpenAI's o-series. In RLVR, rewards are derived from verifiable signals-such as passing unit tests in code generation or matching correct answers in mathematical reasoning. While effective, this requirement largely confines RLVR to domains with automatically checkable outcomes. To overcome this, we extend the RLVR paradigm to open-ended tasks by integrating rubric-based rewards, where carefully designed rubrics serve as structured, model-interpretable criteria for automatic scoring of subjective outputs. We construct, to our knowledge, the largest rubric reward system to date, with over 10,000 rubrics from humans, LLMs, or a hybrid human-LLM collaboration. Implementing rubric-based RL is challenging; we tackle these issues with a clear framework and present an open-sourced Qwen-30B-A3B model with notable gains: 1) With only 5K+ samples, our system improves by +5.2% on open-ended benchmarks (especially humanities), outperforming a 671B DeepSeek-V3 model by +2.4%, while preserving general and reasoning abilities. 2) Our method provides fine-grained stylistic control, using rubrics as anchors to mitigate the "AI-like" tone and produce more human-like, expressive responses. We share key lessons in rubric construction, data selection, and training, and discuss limitations and future releases.</p></details> | technical report |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code executability over existing VLMs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Control Barrier Functions for Safety-Critical Autonomous Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14850v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of safe policy learning in multi-agent safety-critical autonomous systems. In such systems, it is necessary for each agent to meet the safety requirements at all times while also cooperating with other agents to accomplish the task. Toward this end, we propose a safe Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HMARL) approach based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Our proposed hierarchical approach decomposes the overall reinforcement learning problem into two levels learning joint cooperative behavior at the higher level and learning safe individual behavior at the lower or agent level conditioned on the high-level policy. Specifically, we propose a skill-based HMARL-CBF algorithm in which the higher level problem involves learning a joint policy over the skills for all the agents and the lower-level problem involves learning policies to execute the skills safely with CBFs. We validate our approach on challenging environment scenarios whereby a large number of agents have to safely navigate through conflicting road networks. Compared with existing state of the art methods, our approach significantly improves the safety achieving near perfect (within 5%) success/safety rate while also improving performance across all the environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Game-Theoretic and Reinforcement Learning-Based Cluster Head Selection for Energy-Efficient Wireless Sensor Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12707v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is critical to network lifetime and data delivery. However, the primary impediment to the durability and dependability of these sensor nodes is their short battery life. Currently, power-saving algorithms such as clustering and routing algorithms have improved energy efficiency in standard protocols. This paper proposes a clustering-based routing approach for creating an adaptive, energy-efficient mechanism. Our system employs a multi-step clustering strategy to select dynamic cluster heads (CH) with optimal energy distribution. We use Game Theory (GT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize resource utilization. Modeling the network as a multi-agent RL problem using GT principles allows for self-clustering while optimizing sensor lifetime and energy balance. The proposed AI-powered CH-Finding algorithm improves network efficiency by preventing premature energy depletion in specific nodes while also ensuring uniform energy usage across the network. Our solution enables controlled power consumption, resulting in a deterministic network lifetime. This predictability lowers maintenance costs by reducing the need for node replacement. Furthermore, our proposed method prevents sensor nodes from disconnecting from the network by designating the sensor with the highest charge as an intermediary and using single-hop routing. This approach improves the energy efficiency and stability of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Taxonomy of Hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems: Design Patterns, Coordination Mechanisms, and Industrial Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12683v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical multi-agent systems (HMAS) organize collections of agents into layered structures that help manage complexity and scale. These hierarchies can simplify coordination, but they also can introduce trade-offs that are not always obvious. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional taxonomy for HMAS along five axes: control hierarchy, information flow, role and task delegation, temporal layering, and communication structure. The intent is not to prescribe a single "best" design but to provide a lens for comparing different approaches. Rather than treating these dimensions in isolation, the taxonomy is connected to concrete coordination mechanisms - from the long-standing contract-net protocol for task allocation to more recent work in hierarchical reinforcement learning. Industrial contexts illustrate the framework, including power grids and oilfield operations, where agents at production, maintenance, and supply levels coordinate to diagnose well issues or balance energy demand. These cases suggest that hierarchical structures may achieve global efficiency while preserving local autonomy, though the balance is delicate. The paper closes by identifying open challenges: making hierarchical decisions explainable to human operators, scaling to very large agent populations, and assessing whether learning-based agents such as large language models can be safely integrated into layered frameworks. This paper presents what appears to be the first taxonomy that unifies structural, temporal, and communication dimensions of hierarchical MAS into a single design framework, bridging classical coordination mechanisms with modern reinforcement learning and large language model agents.</p></details> |  |

However, the long propagation delay and limited network capacity of underwater communication networks (UCN) negatively impact the service quality of SAGAIN. To address this issue, this paper presents U-HPNF, a hierarchical framework designed to achieve a high-performance network with self-management, self-configuration, and self-optimization capabilities. U-HPNF leverages the sensing and decision-making capabilities of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to manage limited resources in UCNs, including communication bandwidth, computational resources, and energy supplies. Additionally, we incorporate federated learning (FL) to iteratively optimize the decision-making model, thereby reducing communication overhead and protecting the privacy of node observation information. By deploying digital twins (DT) at both the intelligent sink layer and aggregation layer, U-HPNF can mimic numerous network scenarios and adapt to varying network QoS requirements. Through a three-tier network design with two-levels DT, U-HPNF provides an AI-native high-performance underwater network. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed U-HPNF framework can effectively optimize network performance across various situations and adapt to changing QoS requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 3rd International Conference on Internet of Things, Communication and Intelligent Technology (IoTCIT 2024)</p></details> |

Dataset-based methods reproduce realistic trajectories but suffer from covariate shift in closed-loop deployment, compounded by simplified dynamics models that further reduce reliability. Conversely, physics-based simulation methods enhance reliable and controllable closed-loop interactions but often lack expert demonstrations, compromising realism. To address these challenges, we introduce a dual-stage AV-centric simulation framework that conducts open-loop imitation learning pre-training in a data-driven simulator to capture trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability, followed by closed-loop reinforcement learning fine-tuning in a physics-based simulator to enhance style-level controllability and mitigate covariate shift. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose RIFT, a novel RL fine-tuning strategy that evaluates all candidate modalities through group-relative optimization with a dual-clip surrogate objective, enhancing style-level controllability and mitigating covariate shift, while preserving the trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability inherited from IL pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFT improves realism and controllability in traffic simulation while simultaneously exposing the limitations of modern AV systems in closed-loop evaluation.

However, cognitive structure assessment remains a long-standing challenge in student modeling and psychometrics, persisting as a foundational yet largely unassessable concept in educational practice. This paper introduces a novel framework, Cognitive Structure Generation (CSG), in which we first pretrain a Cognitive Structure Diffusion Probabilistic Model (CSDPM) to generate students' cognitive structures from educational priors, and then further optimize its generative process as a policy with hierarchical reward signals via reinforcement learning to align with genuine cognitive development levels during students' learning processes. Experimental results on four popular real-world education datasets show that cognitive structures generated by CSG offer more comprehensive and effective representations for student modeling, substantially improving performance on KT and CD tasks while enhancing interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Plan Transformer for Trajectory Abstraction: Planning as Latent Space Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04647v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In tasks aiming for long-term returns, planning becomes essential. We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[DCT-MARL: A Dynamic Communication Topology-Based MARL Algorithm for Connected Vehicle Platoon Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12633v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of vehicular communication and autonomous driving technologies, connected vehicle platoon has emerged as a promising approach to improve traffic efficiency and driving safety. Reliable Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication is critical to achieving efficient cooperative control. However, in real-world traffic environments, V2V links may suffer from time-varying delay and packet loss, leading to degraded control performance and even safety risks. To mitigate the adverse effects of non-ideal communication, this paper proposes a Dynamic Communication Topology based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DCT-MARL) algorithm for robust cooperative platoon control. Specifically, the state space is augmented with historical control action and delay to enhance robustness against communication delay. To mitigate the impact of packet loss, a multi-key gated communication mechanism is introduced, which dynamically adjusts the communication topology based on the correlation between agents and their current communication status.Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DCT-MARL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of string stability and driving comfort, validating its superior robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

An eye-catching creative image can enhance the shopping experience for users, boosting income for advertisers and advertising revenue for platforms. With the advent of AIGC technology, advertisers can produce large quantities of creative images at minimal cost. However, they struggle to assess the creative quality to select. Existing methods primarily focus on creative ranking, which fails to address the need for explainable creative selection. In this work, we propose the first paradigm for explainable creative assessment and selection. Powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs), our approach integrates the assessment and selection of creative images into a natural language generation task. To facilitate this research, we construct CreativePair, the first comparative reasoning-induced creative dataset featuring 8k annotated image pairs, with each sample including a label indicating which image is superior. Additionally, we introduce Creative4U (pronounced Creative for You), a MLLMs-based creative selector that takes into account users' interests. Through Reason-to-Select RFT, which includes supervised fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning, Creative4U is able to evaluate and select creative images accurately. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code and dataset will be made public to advance research and industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SALSA-RL: Stability Analysis in the Latent Space of Actions for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15512v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have made significant advances in handling continuous action spaces. However, real-world control systems--especially those requiring precise and reliable performance--often demand interpretability in the sense of a-priori assessments of agent behavior to identify safe or failure-prone interactions with environments. To address this limitation, we propose SALSA-RL (Stability Analysis in the Latent Space of Actions), a novel RL framework that models control actions as dynamic, time-dependent variables evolving within a latent space. By employing a pre-trained encoder-decoder and a state-dependent linear system, our approach enables interpretability through local stability analysis, where instantaneous growth in action-norms can be predicted before their execution. We demonstrate that SALSA-RL can be deployed in a non-invasive manner for assessing the local stability of actions from pretrained RL agents without compromising on performance across diverse benchmark environments. By enabling a more interpretable analysis of action generation, SALSA-RL provides a powerful tool for advancing the design, analysis, and theoretical understanding of RL systems.</p></details> |  |

However, mainstream post-training methods (i.e., reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning) often incur substantial computational overhead due to auxiliary models and overthinking. In this paper, we empirically reveal that the incorrect answers partially stem from verbose reasoning processes lacking correct self-fix, where errors accumulate across multiple reasoning steps. To this end, we propose Self-traced Step-wise Preference Optimization (SSPO), a pluggable RL process supervision framework that enables fine-grained optimization of each reasoning step. Specifically, SSPO requires neither auxiliary models nor stepwise manual annotations. Instead, it leverages step-wise preference signals generated by the model itself to guide the optimization process for reasoning compression. Experiments demonstrate that the generated reasoning sequences from SSPO are both accurate and succinct, effectively mitigating overthinking behaviors without compromising model performance across diverse domains and languages.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Despite the notable advances enabled by existing RLHF training frameworks, significant challenges remain to scale to complex multimodal workflows and adapt to dynamic workloads. In particular, current systems often encounter limitations related to controller scalability when managing large models, as well as inefficiencies in orchestrating intricate RLHF pipelines, especially in scenarios that require dynamic sampling and resource allocation. In this paper, we introduce WeChat-YATT Yet Another Transformer Trainer in WeChat, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework specifically designed to address these challenges. WeChat-YATT features a parallel controller programming model that enables flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows, effectively mitigating bottlenecks associated with centralized controller architectures and facilitating scalability in large-scale data scenarios. In addition, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions computational resources and schedules workloads, thereby significantly reducing hardware idle time and improving GPU utilization under variable training conditions. We evaluate WeChat-YATT across diverse experimental scenarios, demonstrating its substantial throughput improvements over state-of-the-art RLHF training frameworks. Furthermore, WeChat-YATT has been successfully deployed to train models that support WeChat product features for a large-scale user base, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in real-world applications.

In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically require extensive retraining even when new tasks share structural similarities with previously learned ones. In this work, we propose MAGIK, a novel framework that enables RL agents to transfer knowledge to analogous tasks without interacting with the target environment. Our approach leverages an imagination mechanism to map entities in the target task to their analogues in the source domain, allowing the agent to reuse its original policy. Experiments on custom MiniGrid and MuJoCo tasks show that MAGIK achieves effective zero-shot transfer using only a small number of human-labelled examples. We compare our approach to related baselines and highlight how it offers a novel and effective mechanism for knowledge transfer via imagination-based analogy mapping.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often face challenges in terms of efficiency, scalability, and generalization. This paper introduces OS-R1, an agentic Linux kernel tuning framework powered by rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). By abstracting the kernel configuration space as an RL environment, OS-R1 facilitates efficient exploration by large language models (LLMs) and ensures accurate configuration modifications. Additionally, custom reward functions are designed to enhance reasoning standardization, configuration modification accuracy, and system performance awareness of the LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase training process that accelerates convergence and minimizes retraining across diverse tuning scenarios. Experimental results show that OS-R1 significantly outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving up to 5.6% performance improvement over heuristic tuning and maintaining high data efficiency. Notably, OS-R1 is adaptable across various real-world applications, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in diverse environments.

Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has an added complexity due to the temporal nature of sequential decision-making. Further, non-AI experts do not necessarily have the ability to alter an agent or its policy. We introduce a technique for using World Models to generate explanations for Model-Based Deep RL agents. World Models predict how the world will change when actions are performed, allowing for the generation of counterfactual trajectories. However, identifying what a user wanted the agent to do is not enough to understand why the agent did something else. We augment Model-Based RL agents with a Reverse World Model, which predicts what the state of the world should have been for the agent to prefer a given counterfactual action. We show that explanations that show users what the world should have been like significantly increase their understanding of the agent policy. We hypothesize that our explanations can help users learn how to control the agents execution through by manipulating the environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Infant Sleep-Optimized Driving: Synergizing Wearable and Vehicle Sensing in Intelligent Cruise Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06459v3)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated driving (AD) has substantially improved vehicle safety and driving comfort, but their impact on passenger well-being, particularly infant sleep, is not sufficiently studied. Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and sharp maneuvers can disrupt infant sleep, compromising both passenger comfort and parental convenience. To solve this problem, this paper explores the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving behavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In particular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to varying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively synergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the relationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse traffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the wearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data from map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving aggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control strategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and overtaking. Simulation experiments conducted in the CARLA environment indicate that the proposed solution significantly improves infant sleep quality compared to baseline methods, while preserving desirable travel efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Cryptographic reasoning offers an ideal RL testbed: it combines precise validation, structured multi-step inference, and reliance on reliable computational tool use. Leveraging these properties, we fine-tune a Python tool-augmented Llama-3.1-8B via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in a secure execution environment. The resulting agent achieves a significant improvement in Pass@8 on previously unseen challenges. Moreover, the improvements generalize to two external benchmarks: 'picoCTF', spanning both crypto and non-crypto tasks, and 'AICrypto MCQ', a multiple-choice benchmark of 135 cryptography questions. Ablation studies attribute the gains to enhanced tool usage and procedural reasoning. These findings position 'Random-Crypto' as a rich training ground for building intelligent, adaptable LLM agents capable of handling complex cybersecurity tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |

We introduce Cold-RL, a learned eviction policy for NGINX that replaces LRU's forced-expire path with a dueling Deep Q-Network served by an ONNX sidecar within a strict microsecond budget. On each eviction, Cold-RL samples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features (age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT), and requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers immediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying NGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained object earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against LRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial workloads. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538, a 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from 0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods (about 0.918). Inference adds less than 2 percent CPU overhead and keeps 95th percentile eviction latency within budget. To our knowledge, this is the first reinforcement learning eviction policy integrated into NGINX with strict SLOs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures (system architecture, eviction path, training pipeline, and DQN algorithm), 2 tables.

Existing ToM benchmarks, however, are restricted to passive observer settings or lack an assessment of how agents establish and maintain common ground over time. To address these gaps, we introduce the Yokai Learning Environment (YLE) - a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on the cooperative card game Yokai. In the YLE, agents take turns peeking at hidden cards and moving them to form clusters based on colour. Success requires tracking evolving beliefs, remembering past observations, using hints as grounded communication, and maintaining common ground with teammates. Our evaluation yields two key findings: First, current RL agents struggle to solve the YLE, even when given access to perfect memory. Second, while belief modelling improves performance, agents are still unable to effectively generalise to unseen partners or form accurate beliefs over longer games, exposing a reliance on brittle conventions rather than robust belief tracking. We use the YLE to investigate research questions in belief modelling, memory, partner generalisation, and scaling to higher-order ToM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the the ToM IJCAI 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

This could generate reliability issues in safety-critical applications, such as in some multiagent domains where agents, and possibly humans, need to interact to reach their goals without harming each other. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL approach, inspired by Seldonian optimization, which returns policies with good performance and statistically guaranteed properties with respect to predefined desirable behaviors. In particular, our focus is on Ad Hoc Teamwork settings, where agents must collaborate with new teammates without prior coordination. Our method requires only a pre-collected dataset, a set of candidate policies for our agent, and a specification about the possible policies followed by the other players -- it does not require further interactions, training, or assumptions on the type and architecture of the policies. We test our algorithm in Ad Hoc Teamwork problems and show that it consistently finds reliable policies while improving sample efficiency with respect to standard ML baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2nd Reinforcement Learning Conference (RLC2025), Edmonton, Canada.

However, existing methods have significant limitations: serialized chain-of-thought approaches generate overly long outputs, leading to increased latency and exhausted context windows, while parallel methods such as self-consistency suffer from insufficient coordination, resulting in redundant computations and limited performance gains. To address these shortcomings, we propose Adaptive Parallel Reasoning (APR), a novel reasoning framework that enables language models to orchestrate both serialized and parallel computations end-to-end. APR generalizes existing reasoning methods by enabling adaptive multi-threaded inference using spawn() and join() operations. A key innovation is our end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, optimizing both parent and child inference threads to enhance task success rate without requiring predefined reasoning structures. Experiments on the Countdown reasoning task demonstrate significant benefits of APR: (1) higher performance within the same context window (83.4% vs. 60.0% at 4k context); (2) superior scalability with increased computation (80.1% vs. 66.6% at 20k total tokens); (3) improved accuracy at equivalent latency (75.2% vs. 57.3% at approximately 5,000ms). APR represents a step towards enabling language models to autonomously optimize their reasoning processes through adaptive allocation of computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COLM 2025.

Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs.</p></details> |  |

However, translating natural language instructions into effective robotic control policies remains a significant challenge, especially for tasks requiring long-horizon planning and operating under sparse reward conditions. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) provides a natural framework to address this challenge in robotics; however, it typically suffers from non-stationarity caused by the changing behavior of the lower-level policy during training, destabilizing higher-level policy learning. We introduce LGR2, a novel HRL framework that leverages LLMs to generate language-guided reward functions for the higher-level policy. By decoupling high-level reward generation from low-level policy changes, LGR2 fundamentally mitigates the non-stationarity problem in off-policy HRL, enabling stable and efficient learning. To further enhance sample efficiency in sparse environments, we integrate goal-conditioned hindsight experience relabeling. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world robotic navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate LGR2 outperforms both hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines, achieving over 55% success rates on challenging tasks and robust transfer to real robots, without additional fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

We propose CRISP, a curriculum-driven framework that tackles this instability with three key ingredients: (1) primitive-informed parsing (PIP), which adaptively re-labels a handful of expert demonstrations to always generate reachable subgoals by the current low-level primitive, (2) an inverse-reinforcement-learning regularizer that steers the high-level policy toward the expert-induced subgoal distribution and stabilizes learning, and (3) a unified training loop that leverages these components to boost sample efficiency. Across six sparse-reward robotic navigation and manipulation benchmarks, CRISP improves success rates by more than 40% over strong hierarchical and flat baselines and successfully transfers to real-world tasks, demonstrating the promise of curriculum-based HRL for practical scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion Large Language Model May Demand a Distinct Position](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12398v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a competitive non-autoregressive paradigm due to their unique training and inference approach. However, there is currently a lack of safety study on this novel architecture. In this paper, we present the first analysis of dLLMs' safety performance and propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to their unique generation characteristics. Specifically, we identify a critical asymmetry between the defender and attacker in terms of security. For the defender, we reveal that the middle tokens of the response, rather than the initial ones, are more critical to the overall safety of dLLM outputs; this seems to suggest that aligning middle tokens can be more beneficial to the defender. The attacker, on the contrary, may have limited power to manipulate middle tokens, as we find dLLMs have a strong tendency towards a sequential generation order in practice, forcing the attack to meet this distribution and diverting it from influencing the critical middle tokens. Building on this asymmetry, we introduce Middle-tOken Safety Alignment (MOSA), a novel method that directly aligns the model's middle generation with safe refusals exploiting reinforcement learning. We implement MOSA and compare its security performance against eight attack methods on two benchmarks. We also test the utility of MOSA-aligned dLLM on coding, math, and general reasoning. The results strongly prove the superiority of MOSA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direct Preference Optimization for Primitive-Enabled Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00361v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) enables agents to solve complex, long-horizon tasks by decomposing them into manageable sub-tasks. However, HRL methods often suffer from two fundamental challenges: (i) non-stationarity, caused by the changing behavior of the lower-level policy during training, which destabilizes higher-level policy learning, and (ii) the generation of infeasible subgoals that lower-level policies cannot achieve. In this work, we introduce DIPPER, a novel HRL framework that formulates hierarchical policy learning as a bi-level optimization problem and leverages direct preference optimization (DPO) to train the higher-level policy using preference feedback. By optimizing the higher-level policy with DPO, we decouple higher-level learning from the non-stationary lower-level reward signal, thus mitigating non-stationarity. To further address the infeasible subgoal problem, DIPPER incorporates a regularization that tries to ensure the feasibility of subgoal tasks within the capabilities of the lower-level policy. Extensive experiments on challenging robotic navigation and manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that DIPPER achieves up to 40\% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in sparse reward scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding limitations of HRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIGN: Safety-Aware Image-Goal Navigation for Autonomous Drones via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12394v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-goal navigation (ImageNav) tasks a robot with autonomously exploring an unknown environment and reaching a location that visually matches a given target image. While prior works primarily study ImageNav for ground robots, enabling this capability for autonomous drones is substantially more challenging due to their need for high-frequency feedback control and global localization for stable flight. In this paper, we propose a novel sim-to-real framework that leverages visual reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve ImageNav for drones. To enhance visual representation ability, our approach trains the vision backbone with auxiliary tasks, including image perturbations and future transition prediction, which results in more effective policy training. The proposed algorithm enables end-to-end ImageNav with direct velocity control, eliminating the need for external localization. Furthermore, we integrate a depth-based safety module for real-time obstacle avoidance, allowing the drone to safely navigate in cluttered environments. Unlike most existing drone navigation methods that focus solely on reference tracking or obstacle avoidance, our framework supports comprehensive navigation behaviors--autonomous exploration, obstacle avoidance, and image-goal seeking--without requiring explicit global mapping. Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReaLM: Reflection-Enhanced Autonomous Reasoning with Small Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12387v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small Language Models (SLMs) are a cost-effective alternative to Large Language Models (LLMs), but often struggle with complex reasoning due to their limited capacity and a tendency to produce mistakes or inconsistent answers during multi-step reasoning. Existing efforts have improved SLM performance, but typically at the cost of one or more of three key aspects: (1) reasoning capability, due to biased supervision that filters out negative reasoning paths and limits learning from errors; (2) autonomy, due to over-reliance on externally generated reasoning signals; and (3) generalization, which suffers when models overfit to teacher-specific patterns. In this paper, we introduce ReaLM, a reinforcement learning framework for robust and self-sufficient reasoning in vertical domains. To enhance reasoning capability, we propose Multi-Route Process Verification (MRPV), which contrasts both positive and negative reasoning paths to extract decisive patterns. To reduce reliance on external guidance and improve autonomy, we introduce Enabling Autonomy via Asymptotic Induction (EAAI), a training strategy that gradually fades external signals. To improve generalization, we apply guided chain-of-thought distillation to encode domain-specific rules and expert knowledge into SLM parameters, making them part of what the model has learned. Extensive experiments on both vertical and general reasoning tasks demonstrate that ReaLM significantly improves SLM performance across aspects (1)-(3) above.</p></details> | 16pages, 3 figures |
| **[Synthetic Data is Sufficient for Zero-Shot Visual Generalization from Offline Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12356v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising framework for training agents using pre-collected datasets without the need for further environment interaction. However, policies trained on offline data often struggle to generalise due to limited exposure to diverse states. The complexity of visual data introduces additional challenges such as noise, distractions, and spurious correlations, which can misguide the policy and increase the risk of overfitting if the training data is not sufficiently diverse. Indeed, this makes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust agents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we propose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We propose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline data to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a diffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method across both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces (Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without requiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods. We show that our method not only increases the diversity of the training data but also significantly reduces the generalization gap at test time while maintaining computational efficiency. We believe this approach could fuel additional progress in generating synthetic data to train more general agents in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRAGE: Towards AI-Generated Image Detection in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13223v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust. Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage. By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10% on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wisdom of the Crowd: Reinforcement Learning from Coevolutionary Collective Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12338v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but its reliance on expensive human-labeled data or complex reward models severely limits scalability. While existing self-feedback methods aim to address this problem, they are constrained by the capabilities of a single model, which can lead to overconfidence in incorrect answers, reward hacking, and even training collapse. To this end, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Coevolutionary Collective Feedback (RLCCF), a novel RL framework that enables multi-model collaborative evolution without external supervision. Specifically, RLCCF optimizes the ability of a model collective by maximizing its Collective Consistency (CC), which jointly trains a diverse ensemble of LLMs and provides reward signals by voting on collective outputs. Moreover, each model's vote is weighted by its Self-Consistency (SC) score, ensuring that more confident models contribute more to the collective decision. Benefiting from the diverse output distributions and complementary abilities of multiple LLMs, RLCCF enables the model collective to continuously enhance its reasoning ability through coevolution. Experiments on four mainstream open-source LLMs across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our framework yields significant performance gains, achieving an average relative improvement of 16.72\% in accuracy. Notably, RLCCF not only improves the performance of individual models but also enhances the group's majority-voting accuracy by 4.51\%, demonstrating its ability to extend the collective capability boundary of the model collective.</p></details> |  |
| **[A robust and compliant robotic assembly control strategy for batch precision assembly task with uncertain fit types and fit amounts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12296v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In some high-precision industrial applications, robots are deployed to perform precision assembly tasks on mass batches of manufactured pegs and holes. If the peg and hole are designed with transition fit, machining errors may lead to either a clearance or an interference fit for a specific pair of components, with uncertain fit amounts. This paper focuses on the robotic batch precision assembly task involving components with uncertain fit types and fit amounts, and proposes an efficient methodology to construct the robust and compliant assembly control strategy. Specifically, the batch precision assembly task is decomposed into multiple deterministic subtasks, and a force-vision fusion controller-driven reinforcement learning method and a multi-task reinforcement learning training method (FVFC-MTRL) are proposed to jointly learn multiple compliance control strategies for these subtasks. Subsequently, the multi-teacher policy distillation approach is designed to integrate multiple trained strategies into a unified student network, thereby establishing a robust control strategy. Real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed method successfully constructs the robust control strategy for high-precision assembly task with different fit types and fit amounts. Moreover, the MTRL framework significantly improves training efficiency, and the final developed control strategy achieves superior force compliance and higher success rate compared with many existing methods.</p></details> |  |

While recent research on humanoid control has leveraged reinforcement learning to track human motions for skill acquisition, applying this paradigm to balance-intensive tasks remains challenging. In this work, we identify three key obstacles: instability from reference motion errors, learning difficulties due to morphological mismatch, and the sim-to-real gap caused by sensor noise and unmodeled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose HuB (Humanoid Balance), a unified framework that integrates reference motion refinement, balance-aware policy learning, and sim-to-real robustness training, with each component targeting a specific challenge. We validate our approach on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot across challenging quasi-static balance tasks, including extreme single-legged poses such as Swallow Balance and Bruce Lee's Kick. Our policy remains stable even under strong physical disturbances-such as a forceful soccer strike-while baseline methods consistently fail to complete these tasks.

The high number of degrees of freedom to control mirrors, lenses, or phases of light makes automatic control challenging, especially when the complexity of the system cannot be adequately modeled due to noise or non-linearities. Here, we show that reinforcement learning (RL) can overcome these challenges when coupling laser light into an optical fiber, using a model-free RL approach that trains directly on the experiment without pre-training on simulations. By utilizing the sample-efficient algorithms Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), or CrossQ, our agents learn to couple with 90% efficiency. A human expert reaches this efficiency, but the RL agents are quicker. In particular, the CrossQ agent outperforms the other agents in coupling speed while requiring only half the training time. We demonstrate that direct training on an experiment can replace extensive system modeling. Our result exemplifies RL's potential to tackle problems in optics, paving the way for more complex applications where full noise modeling is not feasible.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages + 12 pages appendices, 2 + 12 figures</p></details> |

Real-world learning, despite being crucial for overcoming the sim-to-real gap, faces substantial challenges related to safety, reward design, and learning efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Robot-Trains-Robot (RTR), a novel framework where a robotic arm teacher actively supports and guides a humanoid robot student. The RTR system provides protection, learning schedule, reward, perturbation, failure detection, and automatic resets. It enables efficient long-term real-world humanoid training with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, we propose a novel RL pipeline that facilitates and stabilizes sim-to-real transfer by optimizing a single dynamics-encoded latent variable in the real world. We validate our method through two challenging real-world humanoid tasks: fine-tuning a walking policy for precise speed tracking and learning a humanoid swing-up task from scratch, illustrating the promising capabilities of real-world humanoid learning realized by RTR-style systems.

Existing methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning, treating tool learning as a text generation problem while overlooking the decision-making complexities inherent in multi-step contexts. In this work, we propose modeling tool learning as a dynamic decision-making process and introduce StepTool, a novel step-grained reinforcement learning framework that enhances LLMs' capabilities in multi-step tool use. StepTool comprises two key components: Step-grained Reward Shaping, which assigns rewards to each tool interaction based on its invocation success and contribution to task completion; and Step-grained Optimization, which applies policy gradient methods to optimize the model across multiple decision steps. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that StepTool consistently outperforms both SFT-based and RL-based baselines in terms of task Pass Rate and Recall of relevant tools. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that StepTool helps models discover new tool-use strategies rather than merely re-weighting prior knowledge. These results highlight the importance of fine-grained decision modeling in tool learning and establish StepTool as a general and robust solution for enhancing multi-step tool use in LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/yuyq18/StepTool.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM'25 |

There are a couple of offline methods for tuning PID gains. However, due to the uncertainty of model parameters and external disturbances, real systems such as Quadrotors need more robust and reliable PID controllers. In this research, a self-tuning PID controller using a Reinforcement-Learning-based Neural Network for attitude and altitude control of a Quadrotor has been investigated. An Incremental PID, which contains static and dynamic gains, has been considered and only the variable gains have been tuned. To tune dynamic gains, a model-free actor-critic-based hybrid neural structure was used that was able to properly tune PID gains, and also has done the best as an identifier. In both tunning and identification tasks, a Neural Network with two hidden layers and sigmoid activation functions has been learned using Adaptive Momentum (ADAM) optimizer and Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm. This method is online, able to tackle disturbance, and fast in training. In addition to robustness to mass uncertainty and wind gust disturbance, results showed that the proposed method had a better performance when compared to a PID controller with constant gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 18 figures, The 30th Annual International Conference of Iranian Society of Mechanical Engineers</p></details> |
| **[Towards Safe Autonomous Driving Policies using a Neuro-Symbolic Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01316v3)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamic nature of driving environments and the presence of diverse road users pose significant challenges for decision-making in autonomous driving. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a popular approach to tackle this problem. However, the application of existing DRL solutions is mainly confined to simulated environments due to safety concerns, impeding their deployment in real-world. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel neuro-symbolic model-free DRL approach, called DRL with Symbolic Logic (DRLSL) that combines the strengths of DRL (learning from experience) and symbolic first-order logic (knowledge-driven reasoning) to enable safe learning in real-time interactions of autonomous driving within real environments. This innovative approach provides a means to learn autonomous driving policies by actively engaging with the physical environment while ensuring safety. We have implemented the DRLSL framework in a highway driving scenario using the HighD dataset and demonstrated that our method successfully avoids unsafe actions during both the training and testing phases. Furthermore, our results indicate that DRLSL achieves faster convergence during training and exhibits better generalizability to new highway driving scenarios compared to traditional DRL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Improving Pre-Trained Vision-Language-Action Policies with Model-Based Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12211v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for generalist robot policies, but often produce brittle behaviours or unsafe failures when deployed zero-shot in out-of-distribution scenarios. We present Vision-Language-Action Planning & Search (VLAPS) -- a novel framework and accompanying algorithms that embed model-based search into the inference procedure of pre-trained VLA policies to improve their performance on robotic tasks. Specifically, our method biases a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm -- run using a model of the target environment -- using action priors defined by the VLA policy. By using VLA-derived abstractions and priors in model-based search, VLAPS efficiently explores language-conditioned robotics tasks whose search spaces would otherwise be intractably large. Conversely, by integrating model-based search with the VLA policy's inference procedure, VLAPS yields behaviours that are more performant than those obtained by directly following the VLA policy's action predictions. VLAPS offers a principled framework to: i) control test-time compute in VLA models, ii) leverage a priori knowledge of the robotic environment, and iii) integrate established planning and reinforcement learning techniques into the VLA inference process. Across all experiments, VLAPS significantly outperforms VLA-only baselines on language-specified tasks that would otherwise be intractable for uninformed search algorithms, increasing success rates by as much as 67 percentage points.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Embod...</summary><p>Embodied-R1 technical report</p></details> |

Unfortunately, researchers use the term "social context" in varied ways. This can lead to miscommunication, making it challenging to draw connections between related work on understanding and modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions. To address this gap, we survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term "social context". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social context of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and we discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers plan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights after interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open research questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems</p></details> |

To achieve that, HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars, robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, presented at TRUST workshop, organised in conjunction with the IEEE RO-MAN 2025 conference, held in Eindhoven, Netherlands</p></details> |

However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer (GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable, and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks. We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blast Hole Seeking and Dipping -- The Navigation and Perception Framework in a Mine Site Inspection Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13785v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site and detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to be inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and properties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in material handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow and expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological properties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - "DIPPeR". In this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a robust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based navigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first processes point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D cone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D domain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face. We then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while suppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for down-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable autonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection parameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity and hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This allows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field tests.

Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators, interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle.

However, current gaze-based assistive systems mainly help users with basic grasping actions, offering limited support. Moreover, the restricted intent recognition capability constrains the assistive system's ability to provide diverse assistance functions. In this paper, we propose an open implicit intention recognition framework powered by Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Foundation Model (VFM), which can process gaze input and recognize user intents that are not confined to predefined or specific scenarios. Furthermore, we implement a gaze-driven LLM-enhanced assistive robot system (MindEye-OmniAssist) that recognizes user's intentions through gaze and assists in completing task. To achieve this, the system utilizes open vocabulary object detector, intention recognition network and LLM to infer their full intentions. By integrating eye movement feedback and LLM, it generates action sequences to assist the user in completing tasks. Real-world experiments have been conducted for assistive tasks, and the system achieved an overall success rate of 41/55 across various undefined tasks. Preliminary results show that the proposed method holds the potential to provide a more user-friendly human-computer interaction interface and significantly enhance the versatility and effectiveness of assistive systems by supporting more complex and diverse task.</p></details> |  |

Our focus is on learning about requirements and potential applications. We are particularly interested in getting both perspectives, the teachers' and the learners' view on how robots could be used and what features they should or should not have. Results show that teachers as well as students are very open to robots in the classroom. However, requirements are partially quite heterogeneous among the groups. This leads to complex design challenges which we discuss at the end of this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, Late Breaking Report accepted for RO-MAN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Assessing Pedestrian Behavior Around Autonomous Cleaning Robots in Public Spaces: Findings from a Field Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13699v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous robots become more common in public spaces, spontaneous encounters with laypersons are more frequent. For this, robots need to be equipped with communication strategies that enhance momentary transparency and reduce the probability of critical situations. Adapting these robotic strategies requires consideration of robot movements, environmental conditions, and user characteristics and states. While numerous studies have investigated the impact of distraction on pedestrians' movement behavior, limited research has examined this behavior in the presence of autonomous robots. This research addresses the impact of robot type and robot movement pattern on distracted and undistracted pedestrians' movement behavior. In a field setting, unaware pedestrians were videotaped while moving past two working, autonomous cleaning robots. Out of N=498 observed pedestrians, approximately 8% were distracted by smartphones. Distracted and undistracted pedestrians did not exhibit significant differences in their movement behaviors around the robots. Instead, both the larger sweeping robot and the offset rectangular movement pattern significantly increased the number of lateral adaptations compared to the smaller cleaning robot and the circular movement pattern. The offset rectangular movement pattern also led to significantly more close lateral adaptations. Depending on the robot type, the movement patterns led to differences in the distances of lateral adaptations. The study provides initial insights into pedestrian movement behavior around an autonomous cleaning robot in public spaces, contributing to the growing field of HRI research.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Three-Level Whole-Body Disturbance Rejection Control Framework for Dynamic Motions in Legged Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13531v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a control framework designed to enhance the stability and robustness of legged robots in the presence of uncertainties, including model uncertainties, external disturbances, and faults. The framework enables the full-state feedback estimator to estimate and compensate for uncertainties in whole-body dynamics of the legged robots. First, we propose a novel moving horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and mitigate noise in legged systems, which can be integrated into the framework for disturbance compensation. Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC). Unlike the previous two-level approach, this three-level framework considers both the plan based on whole-body dynamics without uncertainties and the plan based on dynamics with uncertainties, significantly improving payload transportation, external disturbance rejection, and fault tolerance. Third, simulations of both humanoid and quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of T-WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on a quadruped robot validate the robustness and stability of the system when using T-WB-DRC under various disturbance conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Robot Navigation in Social Mini-Games: Definitions, Taxonomy, and Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13459v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to navigate constrained and cluttered environments (e.g., doorways, hallways, corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs are tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general multi-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain distinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them. Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs, which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods specialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years. However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation, etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly.</p></details> |  |

However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We present Switch4EAI(Switch-for-Embodied-AI), a low-cost and easily deployable pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games to evaluate whole-body robot control policies. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future work to for benchmarking embodied AI.</p></details> | Workshop Submission |
| **[Integrating emotional intelligence, memory architecture, and gestures to achieve empathetic humanoid robot interaction in an educational setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19803v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the integration of individual human traits into an empathetically adaptive educational robot tutor system designed to improve student engagement and learning outcomes with corresponding Engagement Vector measurement. While prior research in the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has examined the integration of the traits, such as emotional intelligence, memory-driven personalization, and non-verbal communication, by themselves, they have thus-far neglected to consider their synchronized integration into a cohesive, operational education framework. To address this gap, we customize a Multi-Modal Large Language Model (LLaMa 3.2 from Meta) deployed with modules for human-like traits (emotion, memory and gestures) into an AI-Agent framework. This constitutes to the robot's intelligent core mimicing the human emotional system, memory architecture and gesture control to allow the robot to behave more empathetically while recognizing and responding appropriately to the student's emotional state. It can also recall the student's past learning record and adapt its style of interaction accordingly. This allows the robot tutor to react to the student in a more sympathetic manner by delivering personalized verbal feedback synchronized with relevant gestures. Our study investigates the extent of this effect through the introduction of Engagement Vector Model which can be a surveyor's pole for judging the quality of HRI experience. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that such an empathetic responsive approach significantly improves student engagement and learning outcomes compared with a baseline humanoid robot without these human-like traits. This indicates that robot tutors with empathetic capabilities can create a more supportive, interactive learning experience that ultimately leads to better outcomes for the student.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Surveillance Based Interactive Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13319v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and responds to speech so a user can monitor and steer it from a phone or browser. The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU acceleration, and adding face and text recognition.</p></details> | 4 pages, 5 figures |

In this research, HRL is evaluated and contrasted with traditional RL in complex robotic navigation tasks. We evaluate unique characteristics of HRL, including its ability to create sub-goals and the termination functions. We constructed a number of experiments to test: 1) the differences between RL proximal policy optimization (PPO) and HRL, 2) different ways of creating sub-goals in HRL, 3) manual vs automatic sub-goal creation in HRL, and 4) the effects of the frequency of termination on performance in HRL. These experiments highlight the advantages of HRL over RL and how it achieves these advantages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large VLM-based Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13073v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide a regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation</p></details> |

However, they are still missing a fundamental social skill: making use of the multiple modalities that carry social interactions. While previous work has focused on task-oriented interactions that require referencing the environment or specific phenomena in social interactions such as dialogue breakdowns, we outline the overall needs of a multimodal system for social conversations with robots. We then argue that vision-language models are able to process this wide range of visual information in a sufficiently general manner for autonomous social robots. We describe how to adapt them to this setting, which technical challenges remain, and briefly discuss evaluation practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the workshop "Human - Foundation Models Interaction: A Focus On Multimodal Information" (FoMo-HRI) at IEEE RO-MAN 2025 (Camera-ready version)</p></details> |
| **[STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |
| **[RoboRetriever: Single-Camera Robot Object Retrieval via Active and Interactive Perception with Dynamic Scene Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12916v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans effortlessly retrieve objects in cluttered, partially observable environments by combining visual reasoning, active viewpoint adjustment, and physical interaction-with only a single pair of eyes. In contrast, most existing robotic systems rely on carefully positioned fixed or multi-camera setups with complete scene visibility, which limits adaptability and incurs high hardware costs. We present \textbf{RoboRetriever}, a novel framework for real-world object retrieval that operates using only a \textbf{single} wrist-mounted RGB-D camera and free-form natural language instructions. RoboRetriever grounds visual observations to build and update a \textbf{dynamic hierarchical scene graph} that encodes object semantics, geometry, and inter-object relations over time. The supervisor module reasons over this memory and task instruction to infer the target object and coordinate an integrated action module combining \textbf{active perception}, \textbf{interactive perception}, and \textbf{manipulation}. To enable task-aware scene-grounded active perception, we introduce a novel visual prompting scheme that leverages large reasoning vision-language models to determine 6-DoF camera poses aligned with the semantic task goal and geometry scene context. We evaluate RoboRetriever on diverse real-world object retrieval tasks, including scenarios with human intervention, demonstrating strong adaptability and robustness in cluttered scenes with only one RGB-D camera.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Model-Predictive Control of a Soft Continuum Robot Using a Physics-Informed Neural Network Based on Cosserat Rod Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12681v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic control of soft continuum robots (SCRs) holds great potential for expanding their applications, but remains a challenging problem due to the high computational demands of accurate dynamic models. While data-driven approaches like Koopman-operator-based methods have been proposed, they typically lack adaptability and cannot capture the full robot shape, limiting their applicability. This work introduces a real-time-capable nonlinear model-predictive control (MPC) framework for SCRs based on a domain-decoupled physics-informed neural network (DD-PINN) with adaptable bending stiffness. The DD-PINN serves as a surrogate for the dynamic Cosserat rod model with a speed-up factor of 44000. It is also used within an unscented Kalman filter for estimating the model states and bending compliance from end-effector position measurements. We implement a nonlinear evolutionary MPC running at 70 Hz on the GPU. In simulation, it demonstrates accurate tracking of dynamic trajectories and setpoint control with end-effector position errors below 3 mm (2.3% of the actuator's length). In real-world experiments, the controller achieves similar accuracy and accelerations up to 3.55 m/s2.</p></details> | 20 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Embodied Image Quality Assessment for Robotic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18774v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of User-Generated Content (UGC) is a critical technique for human Quality of Experience (QoE). However, does the the image quality of Robot-Generated Content (RGC) demonstrate traits consistent with the Moravec paradox, potentially conflicting with human perceptual norms? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the perception mechanism of embodied robots for image quality. We propose the first Embodied Preference Database (EPD), which contains 12,500 distorted image annotations. We establish assessment metrics based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, there is a gap between UGC and RGC. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-scale Attention Embodied Image Quality Assessment called MA-EIQA. For the proposed EPD dataset, this is the first no-reference IQA model designed for embodied robot. Finally, the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vibration-Based Energy Metric for Restoring Needle Alignment in Autonomous Robotic Ultrasound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06921v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise needle alignment is essential for percutaneous needle insertion in robotic ultrasound-guided procedures. However, inherent challenges such as speckle noise, needle-like artifacts, and low image resolution make robust needle detection difficult, particularly when visibility is reduced or lost. In this paper, we propose a method to restore needle alignment when the ultrasound imaging plane and the needle insertion plane are misaligned. Unlike many existing approaches that rely heavily on needle visibility in ultrasound images, our method uses a more robust feature by periodically vibrating the needle using a mechanical system. Specifically, we propose a vibration-based energy metric that remains effective even when the needle is fully out of plane. Using this metric, we develop a control strategy to reposition the ultrasound probe in response to misalignments between the imaging plane and the needle insertion plane in both translation and rotation. Experiments conducted on ex-vivo porcine tissue samples using a dual-arm robotic ultrasound-guided needle insertion system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results show the translational error of 0.41$\pm$0.27 mm and the rotational error of 0.51$\pm$0.19 degrees.</p></details> | Accepted by IROS2025 |

In response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++ (Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time performance at $\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Although safe reactive approaches have been proposed to ensure robot safety in complex environments, many base their theory off the assumption that the robot has prior knowledge on obstacle locations and geometries. In this paper, we present a real-time, vision-based framework that constructs continuous, first-order differentiable Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) of unknown environments entirely online, without any pre-training, and is fully compatible with established SDF-based reactive controllers. To achieve robust performance under practical sensing conditions, our approach explicitly accounts for noise in affordable RGB-D cameras, refining the neural SDF representation online for smoother geometry and stable gradient estimates. We validate the proposed method in simulation and real-world experiments using a Fetch robot.</p></details> |  |

Predicting and managing oil spill trajectories is highly complex, due to the interplay of physical, chemical, and environmental factors such as wind, currents, and temperature, which makes timely and effective response challenging. Accurate real-time trajectory forecasting and coordinated mitigation are vital for minimizing the impact of these disasters. This study introduces an integrated framework combining a multi-agent swarm robotics system built on the MOOS-IvP platform with Liquid Time-Constant Neural Networks (LTCNs). The proposed system fuses adaptive machine learning with autonomous marine robotics, enabling real-time prediction, dynamic tracking, and rapid response to evolving oil spills. By leveraging LTCNs--well-suited for modeling complex, time-dependent processes--the framework achieves real-time, high-accuracy forecasts of spill movement. Swarm intelligence enables decentralized, scalable, and resilient decision-making among robot agents, enhancing collective monitoring and containment efforts. Our approach was validated using data from the Deepwater Horizon spill, where the LTC-RK4 model achieved 0.96 spatial accuracy, surpassing LSTM approaches by 23%. The integration of advanced neural modeling with autonomous, coordinated robotics demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction precision, flexibility, and operational scalability. Ultimately, this research advances the state-of-the-art for sustainable, autonomous oil spill management and environmental protection by enhancing both trajectory prediction and response coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 40 figures.

| **[The Foundational Pose as a Selection Mechanism for the Design of Tool-Wielding Multi-Finger Robotic Hands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14158v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To wield an object means to hold and move it in a way that exploits its functions. When humans wield tools -- such as writing with a pen or cutting with scissors -- our hands would reach very specific poses, often drastically different from how we pick up the same objects just to transport them. In this work, we investigate the design of tool-wielding multi-finger robotic hand through a hypothesis: If a hand can kinematically reach a foundational pose (FP) with a tool, then it can wield the tool from that FP. We interpret FPs as snapshots that capture the workings of underlying parallel mechanisms formed by the tool and the hand, and one hand can form multiple mechanisms with the same tool. We tested our hypothesis in a hand design experiment, where we developed a sampling-based multi-objective design optimization framework that uses three FPs to computationally generate many different hand designs and evaluate them. The results show that 10,785 out of the 100,480 hand designs we sampled reached the FPs; more than 99\% of the 10,785 hands that reached the FPs successfully wielded tools, supporting our hypothesis. Meanwhile, our methods provide insights into the non-convex, multi-objective hand design optimization problem -- such as clustering and the Pareto front -- that could be hard to unveil with methods that return a single ``optimal" design. Lastly, we demonstrate our methods' real-world feasibility and potential with a hardware prototype equipped with rigid endoskeleton and soft skin.</p></details> |  |

We evaluated various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and collected two datasets to study the impact of data representation and model architecture on the recognition accuracy. Our results show that spectrogram-based representations significantly improve accuracy, while model architecture plays a smaller role. We also tested generalization to new robot poses, where spectrogram-based models performed better. Implemented on a Franka Emika Research robot, two of our methods, STFT2DCNN and STT3DCNN, achieved over 95% accuracy in contact detection and gesture classification. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of external-sensor-free tactile recognition and promote further research toward cost-effective, scalable solutions for HRC.</p></details> |  |
| **[A robust and compliant robotic assembly control strategy for batch precision assembly task with uncertain fit types and fit amounts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12296v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In some high-precision industrial applications, robots are deployed to perform precision assembly tasks on mass batches of manufactured pegs and holes. If the peg and hole are designed with transition fit, machining errors may lead to either a clearance or an interference fit for a specific pair of components, with uncertain fit amounts. This paper focuses on the robotic batch precision assembly task involving components with uncertain fit types and fit amounts, and proposes an efficient methodology to construct the robust and compliant assembly control strategy. Specifically, the batch precision assembly task is decomposed into multiple deterministic subtasks, and a force-vision fusion controller-driven reinforcement learning method and a multi-task reinforcement learning training method (FVFC-MTRL) are proposed to jointly learn multiple compliance control strategies for these subtasks. Subsequently, the multi-teacher policy distillation approach is designed to integrate multiple trained strategies into a unified student network, thereby establishing a robust control strategy. Real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed method successfully constructs the robust control strategy for high-precision assembly task with different fit types and fit amounts. Moreover, the MTRL framework significantly improves training efficiency, and the final developed control strategy achieves superior force compliance and higher success rate compared with many existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bimanual Robot-Assisted Dressing: A Spherical Coordinate-Based Strategy for Tight-Fitting Garments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12274v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot-assisted dressing is a popular but challenging topic in the field of robotic manipulation, offering significant potential to improve the quality of life for individuals with mobility limitations. Currently, the majority of research on robot-assisted dressing focuses on how to put on loose-fitting clothing, with little attention paid to tight garments. For the former, since the armscye is larger, a single robotic arm can usually complete the dressing task successfully. However, for the latter, dressing with a single robotic arm often fails due to the narrower armscye and the property of diminishing rigidity in the armscye, which eventually causes the armscye to get stuck. This paper proposes a bimanual dressing strategy suitable for dressing tight-fitting clothing. To facilitate the encoding of dressing trajectories that adapt to different human arm postures, a spherical coordinate system for dressing is established. We uses the azimuthal angle of the spherical coordinate system as a task-relevant feature for bimanual manipulation. Based on this new coordinate, we employ Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) for imitation learning of bimanual dressing trajectories, generating dressing strategies that adapt to different human arm postures. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through various experiments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 41 figures |
| **[Robot Trains Robot: Automatic Real-World Policy Adaptation and Learning for Humanoids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12252v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced humanoid locomotion tasks, yet direct real-world RL from scratch or adapting from pretrained policies remains rare, limiting the full potential of humanoid robots. Real-world learning, despite being crucial for overcoming the sim-to-real gap, faces substantial challenges related to safety, reward design, and learning efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Robot-Trains-Robot (RTR), a novel framework where a robotic arm teacher actively supports and guides a humanoid robot student. The RTR system provides protection, learning schedule, reward, perturbation, failure detection, and automatic resets. It enables efficient long-term real-world humanoid training with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, we propose a novel RL pipeline that facilitates and stabilizes sim-to-real transfer by optimizing a single dynamics-encoded latent variable in the real world. We validate our method through two challenging real-world humanoid tasks: fine-tuning a walking policy for precise speed tracking and learning a humanoid swing-up task from scratch, illustrating the promising capabilities of real-world humanoid learning realized by RTR-style systems.

An automated-but-audited pipeline combined Google Scholar seeding, backward/forward snowballing, and large-language-model (LLM) assistance for screening and data extraction, with ~10% human audits at each automated step and consensus-with-tie-breaks for full-text decisions. The final corpus comprises 79 peer-reviewed studies analyzed across application domain, metrics, evaluation type, energy models, major energy consumers, software technique families, and energy-quality trade-offs. Industrial settings dominate (31.6%) followed by exploration (25.3%). Motors/actuators are identified as the primary consumer in 68.4% of studies, with computing/controllers a distant second (13.9%). Simulation-only evaluations remain most common (51.9%), though hybrid evaluations are frequent (25.3%). Representational (physics-grounded) energy models predominate (87.3%). Motion and trajectory optimization is the leading technique family (69.6%), often paired with learning/prediction (40.5%) and computation allocation/scheduling (26.6%); power management/idle control (11.4%) and communication/data efficiency (3.8%) are comparatively underexplored. Reporting is heterogeneous: composite objectives that include energy are most common, while task-normalized and performance-per-energy metrics appear less often, limiting cross-paper comparability. The review offers a minimal reporting checklist (e.g., total energy and average power plus a task-normalized metric and clear baselines) and highlights opportunities in cross-layer designs and in quantifying non-performance trade-offs (accuracy, stability). A replication package with code, prompts, and frozen datasets accompanies the review.</p></details> |  |

We describe our difficulties with deploying a social robot in two different public settings: 1) Student services center; 2) Refugees and asylum seekers drop-in service. Although this is a failure report, in each use case we eventually managed to earn the trust of the staff and form a relationship with them, allowing us to deploy our robot and conduct our studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the workshop on Real-World HRI in Public and Private Spaces: Successes, Failures, and Lessons Learned (PubRob-Fails), held at the IEEE RO-MAN Conference, 2025 (paper PubRob-Fails/2025/4)</p></details> |
| **[Fully Spiking Actor-Critic Neural Network for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12038v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a hybrid curriculum reinforcement learning (CRL) framework based on a fully spiking neural network (SNN) for 9-degree-of-freedom robotic arms performing target reaching and grasping tasks. To reduce network complexity and inference latency, the SNN architecture is simplified to include only an input and an output layer, which shows strong potential for resource-constrained environments. Building on the advantages of SNNs-high inference speed, low energy consumption, and spike-based biological plausibility, a temporal progress-partitioned curriculum strategy is integrated with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. Meanwhile, an energy consumption modeling framework is introduced to quantitatively compare the theoretical energy consumption between SNNs and conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). A dynamic two-stage reward adjustment mechanism and optimized observation space further improve learning efficiency and policy accuracy. Experiments on the Isaac Gym simulation platform demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance under realistic physical constraints. Comparative evaluations with conventional PPO and ANN baselines validate the scalability and energy efficiency of the proposed approach in dynamic robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ExploreVLM: Closed-Loop Robot Exploration Task Planning with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11918v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of embodied intelligence is accelerating the integration of robots into daily life as human assistants. This evolution requires robots to not only interpret high-level instructions and plan tasks but also perceive and adapt within dynamic environments. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) present a promising solution by combining visual understanding and language reasoning. However, existing VLM-based methods struggle with interactive exploration, accurate perception, and real-time plan adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose ExploreVLM, a novel closed-loop task planning framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The framework is built around a step-wise feedback mechanism that enables real-time plan adjustment and supports interactive exploration. At its core is a dual-stage task planner with self-reflection, enhanced by an object-centric spatial relation graph that provides structured, language-grounded scene representations to guide perception and planning. An execution validator supports the closed loop by verifying each action and triggering re-planning. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that ExploreVLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in exploration-centric tasks. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the reflective planner and structured perception in achieving robust and efficient task execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Control of Legged Robots using Model Predictive Optimized Path Integral](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11917v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legged robots possess a unique ability to traverse rough terrains and navigate cluttered environments, making them well-suited for complex, real-world unstructured scenarios. However, such robots have not yet achieved the same level as seen in natural systems. Recently, sampling-based predictive controllers have demonstrated particularly promising results. This paper investigates a sampling-based model predictive strategy combining model predictive path integral (MPPI) with cross-entropy (CE) and covariance matrix adaptation (CMA) methods to generate real-time whole-body motions for legged robots across multiple scenarios. The results show that combining the benefits of MPPI, CE and CMA, namely using model predictive optimized path integral (MPOPI), demonstrates greater sample efficiency, enabling robots to attain superior locomotion results using fewer samples when compared to typical MPPI algorithms. Extensive simulation experiments in multiple scenarios on a quadruped robot show that MPOPI can be used as an anytime control strategy, increasing locomotion capabilities at each iteration.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 13 figures, Humanoid conference</p></details> |

However, effective navigation and situational awareness depend on users' prior knowledge of the environment, limiting the usefulness of these systems for exploring unfamiliar places. We explore how integrating location-aware LLM-based narrative capabilities into a mobile robot can support remote exploration. We developed a prototype system, called NarraGuide, that provides narrative guidance for users to explore and learn about a remote place through a dialogue-based interface. We deployed our prototype in a geology museum, where remote participants (n=20) used the robot to tour the museum. Our findings reveal how users perceived the robot's role, engaged in dialogue in the tour, and expressed preferences for bystander encountering. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLM-enabled robotic capabilities to deliver location-aware narrative guidance and enrich the experience of exploring remote environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crossing the Human-Robot Embodiment Gap with Sim-to-Real RL using One Human Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12609v3)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching robots dexterous manipulation skills often requires collecting hundreds of demonstrations using wearables or teleoperation, a process that is challenging to scale. Videos of human-object interactions are easier to collect and scale, but leveraging them directly for robot learning is difficult due to the lack of explicit action labels and human-robot embodiment differences. We propose Human2Sim2Robot, a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework for training dexterous manipulation policies using only one RGB-D video of a human demonstrating a task. Our method utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation to cross the embodiment gap without relying on wearables, teleoperation, or large-scale data collection. From the video, we extract: (1) the object pose trajectory to define an object-centric, embodiment-agnostic reward, and (2) the pre-manipulation hand pose to initialize and guide exploration during RL training. These components enable effective policy learning without any task-specific reward tuning. In the single human demo regime, Human2Sim2Robot outperforms object-aware replay by over 55% and imitation learning by over 68% on grasping, non-prehensile manipulation, and multi-step tasks.

Entertainment as a field prioritizes visuals and form, a principle that contrasts with the purely functional designs of most contemporary humanoid robots. Designing entertainment humanoid robots capable of fluid movement presents a number of unique challenges. In this paper, we present Kid Cosmo, a research platform designed for robust locomotion and life-like motion generation while imitating the look and mannerisms of its namesake character from Netflix's movie The Electric State. Kid Cosmo is a child-sized humanoid robot, standing 1.45 m tall and weighing 25 kg. It contains 28 degrees of freedom and primarily uses proprioceptive actuators, enabling torque-control walking and lifelike motion generation. Following worldwide showcases as part of the movie's press tour, we present the system architecture, challenges of a functional entertainment robot and unique solutions, and our initial findings on stability during simultaneous upper and lower body movement. We demonstrate the viability of performance-oriented humanoid robots that prioritize both character embodiment and technical functionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 14 figures, accepted by IEEE Humanoids 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bioinspired underwater soft robots: from biology to robotics and back](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11883v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ocean vast unexplored regions and diverse soft-bodied marine organisms have spurred interest in bio-inspired underwater soft robotics. Recent advances have enabled new capabilities in underwater movement, sensing, and interaction. However, these efforts are largely unidirectional, with biology guiding robotics while insights from robotics rarely feed back into biology. Here we propose a holistic, bidirectional framework that integrates biological principles, robotic implementation, and biological validation. We show that soft robots can serve as experimental tools to probe biological functions and even test evolutionary hypotheses. Their inherent compliance also allows them to outperform rigid systems in unstructured environments, supporting applications in marine exploration, manipulation, and medicine. Looking forward, we introduce bio-universal-inspired robotics, a paradigm that transcends species-specific mimicry by identifying convergent principles across species to inspire more adaptable designs. Despite rapid progress, challenges persist in material robustness, actuation efficiency, autonomy, and intelligence. By uniting biology and engineering, soft robots can advance ocean exploration and deepen scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe and Efficient Robot Action Planning in the Presence of Unconcerned Humans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13203v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a robot action planning scheme that provides an efficient and probabilistically safe plan for a robot interacting with an unconcerned human -- someone who is either unaware of the robot's presence or unwilling to engage in ensuring safety. The proposed scheme is predictive, meaning that the robot is required to predict human actions over a finite future horizon; such predictions are often inaccurate in real-world scenarios. One possible approach to reduce the uncertainties is to provide the robot with the capability of reasoning about the human's awareness of potential dangers. This paper discusses that by using a binary variable, so-called danger awareness coefficient, it is possible to differentiate between concerned and unconcerned humans, and provides a learning algorithm to determine this coefficient by observing human actions. Moreover, this paper argues how humans rely on predictions of other agents' future actions (including those of robots in human-robot interaction) in their decision-making. It also shows that ignoring this aspect in predicting human's future actions can significantly degrade the efficiency of the interaction, causing agents to deviate from their optimal paths. The proposed robot action planning scheme is verified and validated via extensive simulation and experimental studies on a LoCoBot WidowX-250.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anticipatory and Adaptive Footstep Streaming for Teleoperated Bipedal Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11802v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving seamless synchronization between user and robot motion in teleoperation, particularly during high-speed tasks, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel approach for transferring stepping motions from the user to the robot in real-time. Instead of directly replicating user foot poses, we retarget user steps to robot footstep locations, allowing the robot to utilize its own dynamics for locomotion, ensuring better balance and stability. Our method anticipates user footsteps to minimize delays between when the user initiates and completes a step and when the robot does it. The step estimates are continuously adapted to converge with the measured user references. Additionally, the system autonomously adjusts the robot's steps to account for its surrounding terrain, overcoming challenges posed by environmental mismatches between the user's flat-ground setup and the robot's uneven terrain. Experimental results on the humanoid robot Nadia demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE-RAS 24th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids)</p></details> |
| **[Using Natural Language for Human-Robot Collaboration in the Real World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11759v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have a vision of a day when autonomous robots can collaborate with humans as assistants in performing complex tasks in the physical world. This vision includes that the robots will have the ability to communicate with their human collaborators using language that is natural to the humans. Traditional Interactive Task Learning (ITL) systems have some of this ability, but the language they can understand is very limited. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides an opportunity to greatly improve the language understanding of robots, yet integrating the language abilities of LLMs with robots that operate in the real physical world is a challenging problem. In this chapter we first review briefly a few commercial robot products that work closely with humans, and discuss how they could be much better collaborators with robust language abilities. We then explore how an AI system with a cognitive agent that controls a physical robot at its core, interacts with both a human and an LLM, and accumulates situational knowledge through its experiences, can be a possible approach to reach that vision. We focus on three specific challenges of having the robot understand natural language, and present a simple proof-of-concept experiment using ChatGPT for each. Finally, we discuss what it will take to turn these simple experiments into an operational system where LLM-assisted language understanding is a part of an integrated robotic assistant that uses language to collaborate with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Why Report Failed Interactions With Robots?! Towards Vignette-based Interaction Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10603v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the quality of human-robot interactions has improved with the advent of LLMs, there are still various factors that cause systems to be sub-optimal when compared to human-human interactions. The nature and criticality of failures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be generalized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been implemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique overlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight these failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the methodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on our personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the strength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a multi-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of robots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted from research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing interaction evaluation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the workshop on Real-World HRI in Public and Private Spaces: Successes, Failures, and Lessons Learned (PubRob-Fails), held at the IEEE RO-MAN Conference, 2025. 6 pages</p></details> |
| **[Dancing with REEM-C: A robot-to-human physical-social communication study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05301v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans often work closely together and relay a wealth of information through physical interaction. Robots, on the other hand, are not yet able to work similarly closely with humans and to effectively convey information when engaging in physical-social human-robot interaction (psHRI). This currently limits the potential of human-robot collaboration to solve real-world problems. This paper investigates how to establish clear and intuitive robot-to-human communication, while considering human comfort during psHRI. We approach this question from the perspective of a leader-follower dancing scenario, in which a full-body humanoid robot leads a human by signaling the next steps through a choice of communication modalities including haptic, visual, and audio signals. This is achieved through the development of a split whole-body control framework combining admittance and impedance control on the upper body, with position control on the lower body for balancing and stepping. Robot-led psHRI participant experiments allowed us to verify controller performance, as well as to build an understanding of what types of communication work better from the perspective of human partners, particularly in terms of perceived effectiveness and comfort.</p></details> | 21 pages, 16 figures |

However, current UGV datasets fall short in meeting the demands for advancing navigation and mapping techniques due to limitations in sensor configuration, time synchronization, ground truth, and scenario diversity. To address these challenges, we present i2Nav-Robot, a large-scale dataset designed for multi-sensor fusion navigation and mapping in indoor-outdoor environments. We integrate multi-modal sensors, including the newest front-view and 360-degree solid-state LiDARs, 4-dimensional (4D) radar, stereo cameras, odometer, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, and inertial measurement units (IMU) on an omnidirectional wheeled robot. Accurate timestamps are obtained through both online hardware synchronization and offline calibration for all sensors. The dataset comprises ten larger-scale sequences covering diverse UGV operating scenarios, such as outdoor streets, and indoor parking lots, with a total length of about 17060 meters. High-frequency ground truth, with centimeter-level accuracy for position, is derived from post-processing integrated navigation methods using a navigation-grade IMU. The proposed i2Nav-Robot dataset is evaluated by more than ten open-sourced multi-sensor fusion systems, and it has proven to have superior data quality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |

Deep neural networks have shown remarkable success in grasp synthesis by learning rich and abstract representations of objects. When deployed at the edge, these models can enable low-latency, low-power inference, making real-time grasping feasible in resource-constrained environments. This work implements Heatmap-Guided Grasp Detection, an end-to-end framework for the detection of 6-Dof grasp poses, on the GAP9 RISC-V System-on-Chip. The model is optimised using hardware-aware techniques, including input dimensionality reduction, model partitioning, and quantisation. Experimental evaluation on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark validates the feasibility of fully on-chip inference, highlighting the potential of low-power MCUs for real-time, autonomous manipulation.</p></details> | Accepted by SMC 2025 |

Traditional methods of manual inspection pose significant challenges, including safety risks, high cognitive demands, and potential inaccuracies due to human limitations. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotic technologies have opened new possibilities for safer, more efficient, and accurate inspection methodologies. Specifically, Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), leveraging robotic platforms equipped with advanced detection algorithms, promises significant improvements in inspection outcomes and reductions in human workload. This study explores the effectiveness of AI-assisted visual crack detection integrated into a mobile Jackal robot platform. The experiment results indicate that HRC enhances inspection accuracy and reduces operator workload, resulting in potential superior performance outcomes compared to traditional manual methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing ROS 2 Communication for Wireless Robotic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11366v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wireless transmission of large payloads, such as high-resolution images and LiDAR point clouds, is a major bottleneck in ROS 2, the leading open-source robotics middleware. The default Data Distribution Service (DDS) communication stack in ROS 2 exhibits significant performance degradation over lossy wireless links. Despite the widespread use of ROS 2, the underlying causes of these wireless communication challenges remain unexplored. In this paper, we present the first in-depth network-layer analysis of ROS 2's DDS stack under wireless conditions with large payloads. We identify the following three key issues: excessive IP fragmentation, inefficient retransmission timing, and congestive buffer bursts. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight and fully compatible DDS optimization framework that tunes communication parameters based on link and payload characteristics. Our solution can be seamlessly applied through the standard ROS 2 application interface via simple XML-based QoS configuration, requiring no protocol modifications, no additional components, and virtually no integration efforts. Extensive experiments across various wireless scenarios demonstrate that our framework successfully delivers large payloads in conditions where existing DDS modes fail, while maintaining low end-to-end latency.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing platforms often lack dedicated support for magnetic materials, making them difficult to use for researchers at different expertise levels. This work introduces an open-source, user-friendly simulation interface using the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), specifically designed to model magnetic soft robots. The tool enables users to define material properties, apply magnetic fields, and observe resulting deformations in real time. By integrating intuitive controls and stress analysis capabilities, it aims to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical design. Four benchmark models -- a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly -- demonstrate its functionality. The software's ease of use makes it accessible to both beginners and advanced researchers. Future improvements will refine accuracy through experimental validation and comparison with industry-standard finite element solvers, ensuring realistic and predictive simulations of magnetic soft robots.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose UniTracker, a three-stage training framework that enables robust and scalable motion tracking across a wide range of human behaviors. In the first stage, we train a teacher policy with privileged observations to generate high-quality actions. In the second stage, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model a universal student policy that can be deployed directly on real hardware. The CVAE structure allows the policy to learn a global latent representation of motion, enhancing generalization to unseen behaviors and addressing the limitations of standard MLP-based policies under partial observations. Unlike pure MLPs that suffer from drift in global attributes like orientation, our CVAE-student policy incorporates global intent during training by aligning a partial-observation prior to the full-observation encoder. In the third stage, we introduce a fast adaptation module that fine-tunes the universal policy on harder motion sequences that are difficult to track directly. This adaptation can be performed both for single sequences and in batch mode, further showcasing the flexibility and scalability of our approach. We evaluate UniTracker in both simulation and real-world settings using a Unitree G1 humanoid, demonstrating strong performance in motion diversity, tracking accuracy, and deployment robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>three...</summary><p>three-stage universal motion tracker for humanoid robots</p></details> |

Developing such tactile capabilities is important for numerous emerging applications that require robots to co-exist and interact closely with humans. Consequently, there has been growing interest in tactile sensing, leading to the development of various technologies, including piezoresistive and piezoelectric sensors, capacitive sensors, magnetic sensors, and optical tactile sensors. These diverse approaches utilise different transduction methods and materials to equip robots with distributed sensing capabilities, enabling more effective physical interactions. These advances have been supported in recent years by simulation tools that generate large-scale tactile datasets to support sensor designs and algorithms to interpret and improve the utility of tactile data. The integration of tactile sensing with other modalities, such as vision, as well as with action strategies for active tactile perception highlights the growing scope of this field. To further the transformative progress in tactile robotics, a holistic approach is essential. In this outlook article, we examine several challenges associated with the current state of the art in tactile robotics and explore potential solutions to inspire innovations across multiple domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, recycling and agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 figures, accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to an arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual units according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, we propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

While task symmetry has emerged as a promising inductive bias to improve efficiency, most prior work is limited to isometric symmetries -- applying the same group transformation to all task objects across all timesteps. In this work, we explore non-isometric symmetries, applying multiple independent group transformations across spatial and temporal dimensions to relax these constraints. We introduce a novel formulation of the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) that incorporates the non-isometric symmetry structures, and propose a simple yet effective data augmentation method, Multi-Group Equivariance Augmentation (MEA). We integrate MEA with offline reinforcement learning to enhance sampling efficiency, and introduce a voxel-based visual representation that preserves translational equivariance. Extensive simulation and real-robot experiments across two manipulation domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visuomotor Grasping with World Models for Surgical Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11200v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grasping is a fundamental task in robot-assisted surgery (RAS), and automating it can reduce surgeon workload while enhancing efficiency, safety, and consistency beyond teleoperated systems. Most prior approaches rely on explicit object pose tracking or handcrafted visual features, limiting their generalization to novel objects, robustness to visual disturbances, and the ability to handle deformable objects. Visuomotor learning offers a promising alternative, but deploying it in RAS presents unique challenges, such as low signal-to-noise ratio in visual observations, demands for high safety and millimeter-level precision, as well as the complex surgical environment. This paper addresses three key challenges: (i) sim-to-real transfer of visuomotor policies to ex vivo surgical scenes, (ii) visuomotor learning using only a single stereo camera pair -- the standard RAS setup, and (iii) object-agnostic grasping with a single policy that generalizes to diverse, unseen surgical objects without retraining or task-specific models. We introduce Grasp Anything for Surgery V2 (GASv2), a visuomotor learning framework for surgical grasping. GASv2 leverages a world-model-based architecture and a surgical perception pipeline for visual observations, combined with a hybrid control system for safe execution. We train the policy in simulation using domain randomization for sim-to-real transfer and deploy it on a real robot in both phantom-based and ex vivo surgical settings, using only a single pair of endoscopic cameras. Extensive experiments show our policy achieves a 65% success rate in both settings, generalizes to unseen objects and grippers, and adapts to diverse disturbances, demonstrating strong performance, generality, and robustness.</p></details> |  |

EmbodiedAgent addresses critical limitations of hallucination in impractical tasks. Our approach integrates a next-action prediction paradigm with a structured memory system to decompose tasks into executable robot skills while dynamically validating actions against environmental constraints. We present MultiPlan+, a dataset of more than 18,000 annotated planning instances spanning 100 scenarios, including a subset of impractical cases to mitigate hallucination. To evaluate performance, we propose the Robot Planning Assessment Schema (RPAS), combining automated metrics with LLM-aided expert grading.

Real-world validation in an office service task highlights its ability to coordinate heterogeneous robots for long-horizon objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Scale Multi-Robot Assembly Planning for Autonomous Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00192v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile autonomous robots have the potential to revolutionize manufacturing processes. However, employing large robot fleets in manufacturing requires addressing challenges including collision-free movement in a shared workspace, effective multi-robot collaboration to manipulate and transport large payloads, complex task allocation due to coupled manufacturing processes, and spatial planning for parallel assembly and transportation of nested subassemblies. We propose a full algorithmic stack for large-scale multi-robot assembly planning that addresses these challenges and can synthesize construction plans for complex assemblies with thousands of parts in a matter of minutes. Our approach takes in a CAD-like product specification and automatically plans a full-stack assembly procedure for a group of robots to manufacture the product. We propose an algorithmic stack that comprises: (i) an iterative radial layout optimization procedure to define a global staging layout for the manufacturing facility, (ii) a graph-repair mixed-integer program formulation and a modified greedy task allocation algorithm to optimally allocate robots and robot sub-teams to assembly and transport tasks, (iii) a geometric heuristic and a hill-climbing algorithm to plan collaborative carrying configurations of robot sub-teams, and (iv) a distributed control policy that enables robots to execute the assembly motion plan collision-free. We also present an open-source multi-robot manufacturing simulator implemented in Julia as a resource to the research community, to test our algorithms and to facilitate multi-robot manufacturing research more broadly. Our empirical results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach by generating plans to manufacture a LEGO model of a Saturn V launch vehicle with 1845 parts, 306 subassemblies, and 250 robots in under three minutes on a standard laptop computer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repos...</summary><p>Repository: https://github.com/sisl/ConstructionBots.jl.

While action chunking is a promising paradigm for robotic manipulation, using RL to directly learn continuous action chunks in a stable and data-efficient manner remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces AC3 (Actor-Critic for Continuous Chunks), a novel RL framework that learns to generate high-dimensional, continuous action sequences. To make this learning process stable and data-efficient, AC3 incorporates targeted stabilization mechanisms for both the actor and the critic. First, to ensure reliable policy improvement, the actor is trained with an asymmetric update rule, learning exclusively from successful trajectories. Second, to enable effective value learning despite sparse rewards, the critic's update is stabilized using intra-chunk $n$-step returns and further enriched by a self-supervised module providing intrinsic rewards at anchor points aligned with each action chunk. We conducted extensive experiments on 25 tasks from the BiGym and RLBench benchmarks. Results show that by using only a few demonstrations and a simple model architecture, AC3 achieves superior success rates on most tasks, validating its effective design.</p></details> |  |

We present an online collision avoidance methodology leveraging 3D convex shape-based High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) to address this issue. While prior works focused on using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for human-robotic arm and single-arm collision avoidance, we explore the problem of collision avoidance between multiple robotic arms operating in a shared space. In our methodology, we utilize the proposed HOCBFs as centralized and decentralized safety filters. These safety filters are compatible with many nominal controllers and ensure safety without significantly restricting the robots' workspace. A key challenge in implementing these filters is the computational overhead caused by the large number of safety constraints and the computation of a Hessian matrix per constraint. We address this challenge by employing numerical differentiation methods to approximate computationally intensive terms. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and real-world experiments with Franka Research 3 robotic arms.

Instead of directly controlling robots through Programming by Demonstration (PbD) or teleoperation, we propose giving instructions by interacting with GhostObjects-world-aligned, life-size virtual twins of physical objects-in augmented reality (AR). By direct manipulation of GhostObjects, users can precisely specify physical goals and spatial parameters, with features including real-world lasso selection of multiple objects and snapping back to default positions, enabling tasks beyond simple pick-and-place.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robotic Ultrasound-Guided Femoral Artery Reconstruction of Anatomically-Representative Phantoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06795v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Femoral artery access is essential for numerous clinical procedures, including diagnostic angiography, therapeutic catheterization, and emergency interventions. Despite its critical role, successful vascular access remains challenging due to anatomical variability, overlying adipose tissue, and the need for precise ultrasound (US) guidance. Needle placement errors can result in severe complications, thereby limiting the procedure to highly skilled clinicians operating in controlled hospital environments. While robotic systems have shown promise in addressing these challenges through autonomous scanning and vessel reconstruction, clinical translation remains limited due to reliance on simplified phantom models that fail to capture human anatomical complexity. In this work, we present a method for autonomous robotic US scanning of bifurcated femoral arteries, and validate it on five vascular phantoms created from real patient computed tomography (CT) data. Additionally, we introduce a video-based deep learning US segmentation network tailored for vascular imaging, enabling improved 3D arterial reconstruction. The proposed network achieves a Dice score of 89.21% and an Intersection over Union of 80.54% on a new vascular dataset. The reconstructed artery centerline is evaluated against ground truth CT data, showing an average L2 error of 0.91+/-0.70 mm, with an average Hausdorff distance of 4.36+/-1.11mm. This study is the first to validate an autonomous robotic system for US scanning of the femoral artery on a diverse set of patient-specific phantoms, introducing a more advanced framework for evaluating robotic performance in vascular imaging and intervention.</p></details> |  |

While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature to characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure, little work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are able to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to model specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners. It is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction with and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In this paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based on models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a large self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss function, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both classification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that the best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1 score of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result makes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an interaction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in social robots with social cognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Task Execution Hierarchies for Redundant Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10780v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern robotic systems, such as mobile manipulators, humanoids, and aerial robots with arms, often possess high redundancy, enabling them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Managing this redundancy is key to achieving reliable and flexible behavior. A widely used approach is the Stack of Tasks (SoT), which organizes control objectives by priority within a unified framework. However, traditional SoTs are manually designed by experts, limiting their adaptability and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework that automatically learns both the hierarchy and parameters of a SoT from user-defined objectives. By combining Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Programming, the system discovers task priorities and control strategies without manual intervention. A cost function based on intuitive metrics such as precision, safety, and execution time guides the learning process. We validate our method through simulations and experiments on the mobile-YuMi platform, a dual-arm mobile manipulator with high redundancy. Results show that the learned SoTs enable the robot to dynamically adapt to changing environments and inputs, balancing competing objectives while maintaining robust task execution. This approach provides a general and user-friendly solution for redundancy management in complex robots, advancing human-centered robot programming and reducing the need for expert design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Episodic Memory Verbalization using Hierarchical Representations of Life-Long Robot Experience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17702v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verbalization of robot experience, i.e., summarization of and question answering about a robot's past, is a crucial ability for improving human-robot interaction. Previous works applied rule-based systems or fine-tuned deep models to verbalize short (several-minute-long) streams of episodic data, limiting generalization and transferability. In our work, we apply large pretrained models to tackle this task with zero or few examples, and specifically focus on verbalizing life-long experiences. For this, we derive a tree-like data structure from episodic memory (EM), with lower levels representing raw perception and proprioception data, and higher levels abstracting events to natural language concepts. Given such a hierarchical representation built from the experience stream, we apply a large language model as an agent to interactively search the EM given a user's query, dynamically expanding (initially collapsed) tree nodes to find the relevant information. The approach keeps computational costs low even when scaling to months of robot experience data. We evaluate our method on simulated household robot data, human egocentric videos, and real-world robot recordings, demonstrating its flexibility and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Human...</summary><p>Humanoids 2025.

| **[Synthesis of Deep Neural Networks with Safe Robust Adaptive Control for Reliable Operation of Wheeled Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10634v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) can enable precise control while maintaining low computational costs by circumventing the need for dynamic modeling. However, the deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international standards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical control policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with differing levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and deployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance under nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach a level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined threshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary control policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC) policy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring stability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system robustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a high-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during operation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently severe such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would jeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC policy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while adhering to safety standards to some extent. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was further validated through real-time experiments using a 6,000 kg WMR.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or large behavior models (LBMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those works advancing towards agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's literature.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose MLM, a reinforcement learning framework driven by both real-world and simulation data. It enables a six-DoF robotic arm--equipped quadruped robot to perform whole-body loco-manipulation for multiple tasks autonomously or under human teleoperation. To address the problem of balancing multiple tasks during the learning of loco-manipulation, we introduce a trajectory library with an adaptive, curriculum-based sampling mechanism. This approach allows the policy to efficiently leverage real-world collected trajectories for learning multi-task loco-manipulation. To address deployment scenarios with only historical observations and to enhance the performance of policy execution across tasks with different spatial ranges, we propose a Trajectory-Velocity Prediction policy network. It predicts unobservable future trajectories and velocities. By leveraging extensive simulation data and curriculum-based rewards, our controller achieves whole-body behaviors in simulation and zero-shot transfer to real-world deployment. Ablation studies in simulation verify the necessity and effectiveness of our approach, while real-world experiments on the Go2 robot with an Airbot robotic arm demonstrate the policy's good performance in multi-task execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Planning Diffusion: Learning and Adapting Robot Motion Planning with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19948v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of optimization-based robot motion planning algorithms is highly dependent on the initial solutions, commonly obtained by running a sampling-based planner to obtain a collision-free path. However, these methods can be slow in high-dimensional and complex scenes and produce non-smooth solutions. Given previously solved path-planning problems, it is highly desirable to learn their distribution and use it as a prior for new similar problems. Several works propose utilizing this prior to bootstrap the motion planning problem, either by sampling initial solutions from it, or using its distribution in a maximum-a-posterior formulation for trajectory optimization. In this work, we introduce Motion Planning Diffusion (MPD), an algorithm that learns trajectory distribution priors with diffusion models. These generative models have shown increasing success in encoding multimodal data and have desirable properties for gradient-based motion planning, such as cost guidance. Given a motion planning problem, we construct a cost function and sample from the posterior distribution using the learned prior combined with the cost function gradients during the denoising process. Instead of learning the prior on all trajectory waypoints, we propose learning a lower-dimensional representation of a trajectory using linear motion primitives, particularly B-spline curves. This parametrization guarantees that the generated trajectory is smooth, can be interpolated at higher frequencies, and needs fewer parameters than a dense waypoint representation. We demonstrate the results of our method ranging from simple 2D to more complex tasks using a 7-dof robot arm manipulator. In addition to learning from simulated data, we also use human demonstrations on a real-world pick-and-place task.</p></details> |  |

Particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) where robotics expertise is lacking, implementing, maintaining and developing robotic systems can be a challenge. As a result, many companies rely on external expertise through system integrators, which, in some cases, can lead to vendor lock-in and external dependency. In the academic research on intelligent manufacturing systems, robots play a critical role in the design of robust autonomous systems. Similar challenges are faced by researchers who want to use robotic systems as a component in a larger smart system, without having to deal with the complexity and vastness of the robot interfaces in detail. In this paper, we propose a software framework that reduces the effort required to deploy a working robotic system. The focus is solely on providing a concept for simplifying the different interfaces of a modern robot system and using an abstraction layer for different manufacturers and models. The Python programming language is used to implement a prototype of the concept.

| **[Split Covariance Intersection Filter Based Visual Localization With Accurate AprilTag Map For Warehouse Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17879v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient localization with conveniently-established map is the fundamental requirement for mobile robot operation in warehouse environments. An accurate AprilTag map can be conveniently established with the help of LiDAR-based SLAM. It is true that a LiDAR-based system is usually not commercially competitive in contrast with a vision-based system, yet fortunately for warehouse applications, only a single LiDAR-based SLAM system is needed to establish an accurate AprilTag map, whereas a large amount of visual localization systems can share this established AprilTag map for their own operations. Therefore, the cost of a LiDAR-based SLAM system is actually shared by the large amount of visual localization systems, and turns to be acceptable and even negligible for practical warehouse applications. Once an accurate AprilTag map is available, visual localization is realized as recursive estimation that fuses AprilTag measurements (i.e. AprilTag detection results) and robot motion data. AprilTag measurements may be nonlinear partial measurements; this can be handled by the well-known extended Kalman filter (EKF) in the spirit of local linearization. AprilTag measurements tend to have temporal correlation as well; however, this cannot be reasonably handled by the EKF. The split covariance intersection filter (Split CIF) is adopted to handle temporal correlation among AprilTag measurements. The Split CIF (in the spirit of local linearization) can also handle AprilTag nonlinear partial measurements. The Split CIF based visual localization system incorporates a measurement adaptive mechanism to handle outliers in AprilTag measurements and adopts a dynamic initialization mechanism to address the kidnapping problem. A comparative study in real warehouse environments demonstrates the potential and advantage of the Split CIF based visual localization solution.</p></details> |  |

Our framework integrates collapsibility information into our existing traversability analysis, as vision and geometric information alone could be misled by unpredictable non-rigid terrains such as soft soil, bush area, or water puddles. With the new traversability analysis framework, our robot has a more comprehensive assessment of unpredictable terrain, which is critical for its safety in outdoor environments. The pipeline first identifies the terrain's geometric and semantic properties using an RGB-D camera and desired probing locations on questionable terrains. These regions are probed using a force sensor to determine the risk of terrain collapsing when the robot steps over it. This risk is formulated as a collapsibility metric, which estimates an unpredictable region's ground collapsibility. Thereafter, the collapsibility metric, together with geometric and semantic spatial data, is combined and analyzed to produce global and local traversability grid maps. These traversability grid maps tell the robot whether it is safe to step over different regions of the map. The grid maps are then utilized to generate optimal paths for the robot to safely navigate to its goal. Our approach has been successfully verified on a quadrupedal robot in both simulation and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |

Based on the very same physical model and motion control, this work exploits the use of such simulated digital double synchronized with a real robot to capture and extract discrepancy information between the two systems, which provides high dimensional cues in multiple physical quantities to represent differences between the modelled and the real world. Soft, non-rigid terrains cause common failures in legged locomotion, whereby visual perception solely is insufficient in estimating such physical properties of terrains. We used digital double to develop the estimation of the collapsibility, which addressed this issue through physical interactions during dynamic walking. The discrepancy in sensory measurements between the real robot and its digital double are used as input of a learning-based algorithm for terrain collapsibility analysis. Although trained only in simulation, the learned model can perform collapsibility estimation successfully in both simulation and real world. Our evaluation of results showed the generalization to different scenarios and the advantages of the digital double to reliably detect nuances in ground conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).

While most existing methods typically employ single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm: applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new insights into efficient locomotion strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Super LiDAR Reflectance for Robotic Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10398v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventionally, human intuition often defines vision as a modality of passive optical sensing, while active optical sensing is typically regarded as measuring rather than the default modality of vision. However, the situation now changes: sensor technologies and data-driven paradigms empower active optical sensing to redefine the boundaries of vision, ushering in a new era of active vision. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors capture reflectance from object surfaces, which remains invariant under varying illumination conditions, showcasing significant potential in robotic perception tasks such as detection, recognition, segmentation, and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). These applications often rely on dense sensing capabilities, typically achieved by high-resolution, expensive LiDAR sensors. A key challenge with low-cost LiDARs lies in the sparsity of scan data, which limits their broader application. To address this limitation, this work introduces an innovative framework for generating dense LiDAR reflectance images from sparse data, leveraging the unique attributes of non-repeating scanning LiDAR (NRS-LiDAR). We tackle critical challenges, including reflectance calibration and the transition from static to dynamic scene domains, facilitating the reconstruction of dense reflectance images in real-world settings. The key contributions of this work include a comprehensive dataset for LiDAR reflectance image densification, a densification network tailored for NRS-LiDAR, and diverse applications such as loop closure and traffic lane detection using the generated dense reflectance images.</p></details> |  |

Our approach enables mobile robots to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation by modeling normalized signal strength as a surrogate probability of source location. Building on Behavioral Entropy(BE) with Prelec's probability weighting function, we define an objective function that adapts robot behavior from risk-averse to risk-seeking based on signal reliability and mission urgency. The framework provides theoretical convergence guarantees under unimodal signal assumptions and practical stability under bounded disturbances. Experimental validation across DARPA SubT and multi-room scenarios demonstrates that BEASST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15% reduction in path length and 20% faster source localization through intelligent uncertainty-driven navigation that dynamically transitions between aggressive pursuit and cautious exploration.</p></details> |  |

However, our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm. Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction. Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of precise manipulation and generalization.

However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging OS-Level Primitives for Robotic Action Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10259v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end imitation learning frameworks (e.g., VLA) are increasingly prominent in robotics, as they enable rapid task transfer by learning directly from perception to control, eliminating the need for complex hand-crafted features. However, even when employing SOTA VLA-based models, they still exhibit limited generalization capabilities and suboptimal action efficiency, due to the constraints imposed by insufficient robotic training datasets. In addition to addressing this problem using model-based approaches, we observe that robotic action slices, which consist of contiguous action steps, exhibit strong analogies to the time slices of threads in traditional operating systems. This insight presents a novel opportunity to tackle the problem at the system level. In this paper, we propose AMS, a robot action management system enhanced with OS-level primitives like exception, context switch and record-and-replay, that improves both execution efficiency and success rates of robotic tasks. AMS first introduces action exception, which facilitates the immediate interruption of robotic actions to prevent error propagation. Secondly, AMS proposes action context, which eliminates redundant computations for VLA-based models, thereby accelerating execution efficiency in robotic actions. Finally, AMS leverages action replay to facilitate repetitive or similar robotic tasks without the need for re-training efforts. We implement AMS in both an emulated environment and on a real robot platform. The evaluation results demonstrate that AMS significantly enhances the model's generalization ability and action efficiency, achieving task success rate improvements ranging from 7x to 24x and saving end-to-end execution time ranging from 29% to 74% compared to existing robotic system without AMS support.</p></details> |  |

Application of neuromorphic computing in robotic locomotion research have largely focused on Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) for bionics robotic control algorithms - inspired from neural circuits governing the collaboration of the limb muscles in animal movement. Implementation of artificial CPGs on neuromorphic hardware platforms can potentially enable adaptive and energy-efficient edge robotics applications in resource constrained environments. However, underlying rewiring mechanisms in CPG for gait emergence process is not well understood. This work addresses the missing gap in literature pertaining to CPG plasticity and underscores the critical homeostatic functionality of astrocytes - a cellular component in the brain that is believed to play a major role in multiple brain functions. This paper introduces an astrocyte regulated Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based CPG for learning locomotion gait through Reward-Modulated STDP for quadruped robots, where the astrocytes help build inhibitory connections among the artificial motor neurons in different limbs. The SNN-based CPG is simulated on a multi-object physics simulation platform resulting in the emergence of a trotting gait while running the robot on flat ground. $23.3\times$ computational power savings is observed in comparison to a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning based robot control algorithm. Such a neuroscience-algorithm co-design approach can potentially enable a quantum leap in the functionality of neuromorphic systems incorporating glial cell functionality.</p></details> |  |
| **[PPL: Point Cloud Supervised Proprioceptive Locomotion Reinforcement Learning for Legged Robots in Crawl Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09950v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The legged locomotion in spatially constrained structures (called crawl spaces) is challenging. In crawl spaces, current exteroceptive locomotion learning methods are limited by large noises and errors of the sensors in possible low visibility conditions, and current proprioceptive locomotion learning methods are difficult in traversing crawl spaces because only ground features are inferred. In this study, a point cloud supervised proprioceptive locomotion reinforcement learning method for legged robots in crawl spaces is proposed. A state estimation network is designed to estimate the robot's surrounding ground and spatial features as well as the robot's collision states using historical proprioceptive sensor data. The point cloud is represented in polar coordinate frame and a point cloud processing method is proposed to efficiently extract the ground and spatial features that are used to supervise the state estimation network learning. Comprehensive reward functions that guide the robot to traverse through crawl spaces after collisions are designed. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, our method exhibits more agile locomotion in crawl spaces. This study enhances the ability of legged robots to traverse spatially constrained environments without requiring exteroceptive sensors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Human-Robot Teaming: Learning Handover Behaviors from 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09855v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-robot teaming (HRT) systems often rely on large-scale datasets of human and robot interactions, especially for close-proximity collaboration tasks such as human-robot handovers. Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although simulation training offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation. We introduce a method for training HRT policies, focusing on human-to-robot handovers, solely from RGB images without the need for real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The goal is to enable the robot to reliably receive objects from a human with stable grasping while avoiding collisions with the human hand. The proposed policy learner leverages sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that our method serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover task, contributing to more seamless and robust HRT.</p></details> | 3 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Physical Autoregressive Model for Robotic Manipulation without Action Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09822v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

As these platforms gain relevance in industrial domains such as construction, mining, and disaster response, immersive interfaces must be rethought to support scalable, safe, and effective human-robot collaboration.

To ensure safe navigation and avoid potential collisions with obstacles, the concept of virtual tubes has been introduced to define safe and navigable regions. However, current control methods in virtual tubes face the congestion issues, particularly in narrow ones with low throughput. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel control method that combines a modified artificial potential field (APF) for swarm navigation and density feedback control for distribution regulation. Then we generate a global velocity field that not only ensures collision-free navigation but also achieves locally input-to-state stability (LISS) for density tracking. Finally, numerical simulations and realistic applications validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method in navigating robot swarms through narrow virtual tubes.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages(brief paper), 12 figures</p></details> |

| **[Interpretable Robot Control via Structured Behavior Trees and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09621v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As intelligent robots become more integrated into human environments, there is a growing need for intuitive and reliable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) interfaces that are adaptable and more natural to interact with. Traditional robot control methods often require users to adapt to interfaces or memorize predefined commands, limiting usability in dynamic, unstructured environments. This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as person tracking and hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the system, a series of real-world experiments was conducted across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical in real-world scenarios, with an average cognition-to-execution accuracy of approximately 94%, making a significant contribution to HRI systems and robots.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) is an essential requirement for ensuring the safety and well-being of workers in laboratories, self-driving or otherwise. Fires are another important risk factor in chemical laboratories. In SDLs, fires that occur close to mobile robots, which use flammable lithium batteries, could have increased severity. Here, we present Chemist Eye, a distributed safety monitoring system designed to enhance situational awareness in SDLs. The system integrates multiple stations equipped with RGB, depth, and infrared cameras, designed to monitor incidents in SDLs. Chemist Eye is also designed to spot workers who have suffered a potential accident or medical emergency, PPE compliance and fire hazards. To do this, Chemist Eye uses decision-making driven by a vision-language model (VLM). Chemist Eye is designed for seamless integration, enabling real-time communication with robots. Based on the VLM recommendations, the system attempts to drive mobile robots away from potential fire locations, exits, or individuals not wearing PPE, and issues audible warnings where necessary. It also integrates with third-party messaging platforms to provide instant notifications to lab personnel. We tested Chemist Eye with real-world data from an SDL equipped with three mobile robots and found that the spotting of possible safety hazards and decision-making performances reached 97 % and 95 %, respectively.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents ESCoT, an enhanced step-based coordinate trajectory planning method for multiple car-like robots. ESCoT incorporates two key strategies: collaborative planning for local robot groups and replanning for duplicate configurations. These strategies effectively enhance the performance of step-based MVTP methods. Through extensive experiments, we show that ESCoT 1) in sparse scenarios, significantly improves solution quality compared to baseline step-based method, achieving up to 70% improvement in typical conflict scenarios and 34% in randomly generated scenarios, while maintaining high solving efficiency; and 2) in dense scenarios, outperforms all baseline methods, maintains a success rate of over 50% even in the most challenging configurations. The results demonstrate that ESCoT effectively solves MVTP, further extending the capabilities of step-based methods. Finally, practical robot tests validate the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Existing models, such as Vicsek and Cucker-Smale, lack collision avoidance, whereas the Olfati-Saber model imposes rigid formations, limiting their applicability in swarm robotics. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a minimal yet expressive model that governs agent dynamics using relative positions, velocities, and local density, modulated by two tunable parameters: the spatial offset and kinetic offset. The model achieves spatially flexible, collision-free behaviors that reflect naturalistic group dynamics. Furthermore, we extend the framework to cognitive autonomous systems, enabling energy-aware phase transitions between swarming and flocking through adaptive control parameter tuning. This cognitively inspired approach offers a robust foundation for real-world applications in multi-robot systems, particularly autonomous aerial swarms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems.

| **[Reactive Model Predictive Contouring Control for Robot Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09502v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This contribution presents a robot path-following framework via Reactive Model Predictive Contouring Control (RMPCC) that successfully avoids obstacles, singularities and self-collisions in dynamic environments at 100 Hz. Many path-following methods rely on the time parametrization, but struggle to handle collision and singularity avoidance while adhering kinematic limits or other constraints. Specifically, the error between the desired path and the actual position can become large when executing evasive maneuvers. Thus, this paper derives a method that parametrizes the reference path by a path parameter and performs the optimization via RMPCC. In particular, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are introduced to avoid collisions and singularities in dynamic environments. A Jacobian-based linearization and Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation enable solving the nonlinear RMPCC problem at 100 Hz, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a factor of 10. Experiments confirm that the framework handles dynamic obstacles in real-world settings with low contouring error and low robot acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, conference paper, Accepted for publication at IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems(IROS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Human2Robot: Learning Robot Actions from Paired Human-Robot Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16587v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilling knowledge from human demonstrations is a promising way for robots to learn and act. Existing methods, which often rely on coarsely-aligned video pairs, are typically constrained to learning global or task-level features. As a result, they tend to neglect the fine-grained frame-level dynamics required for complex manipulation and generalization to novel tasks. We posit that this limitation stems from a vicious circle of inadequate datasets and the methods they inspire. To break this cycle, we propose a paradigm shift that treats fine-grained human-robot alignment as a conditional video generation problem. To this end, we first introduce H&R, a novel third-person dataset containing 2,600 episodes of precisely synchronized human and robot motions, collected using a VR teleoperation system. We then present Human2Robot, a framework designed to leverage this data. Human2Robot employs a Video Prediction Model to learn a rich and implicit representation of robot dynamics by generating robot videos from human input, which in turn guides a decoupled action decoder. Our real-world experiments demonstrate that this approach not only achieves high performance on seen tasks but also exhibits significant one-shot generalization to novel positions, objects, instances, and even new task categories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Touch and Tell: Multimodal Decoding of Human Emotions and Social Gestures for Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03300v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human emotions are complex and can be conveyed through nuanced touch gestures. Previous research has primarily focused on how humans recognize emotions through touch or on identifying key features of emotional expression for robots. However, there is a gap in understanding how reliably these emotions and gestures can be communicated to robots via touch and interpreted using data driven methods. This study investigates the consistency and distinguishability of emotional and gestural expressions through touch and sound. To this end, we integrated a custom piezoresistive pressure sensor as well as a microphone on a social robot. Twenty-eight participants first conveyed ten different emotions to the robot using spontaneous touch gestures, then they performed six predefined social touch gestures. Our findings reveal statistically significant consistency in both emotion and gesture expression among participants. However, some emotions exhibited low intraclass correlation values, and certain emotions with similar levels of arousal or valence did not show significant differences in their conveyance. To investigate emotion and social gesture decoding within affective human-robot tactile interaction, we developed single-modality models and multimodal models integrating tactile and auditory features. A support vector machine (SVM) model trained on multimodal features achieved the highest accuracy for classifying ten emotions, reaching 40 %.For gesture classification, a Convolutional Neural Network- Long Short-Term Memory Network (CNN-LSTM) achieved 90.74 % accuracy. Our results demonstrate that even though the unimodal models have the potential to decode emotions and touch gestures, the multimodal integration of touch and sound significantly outperforms unimodal approaches, enhancing the decoding of both emotions and gestures.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a framework that autonomously generates realistic and diverse robotic emotional expressions based on expert human demonstrations captured in Mixed Reality (MR). Our system enables experts to teleoperate a virtual robot from a first-person perspective, capturing their facial expressions, head movements, and upper-body gestures, and mapping these behaviors onto corresponding robotic components including eyes, ears, neck, and arms. Leveraging a flow-matching-based generative process, our model learns to produce coherent and varied behaviors in real-time in response to moving objects, conditioned explicitly on given emotional states. A preliminary test validated the effectiveness of our approach for generating autonomous expressions.</p></details> | 4 |

While prior work focused on learning simple forward gaits, our framework extends on-robot learning to omnidirectional locomotion. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach in different indoor and outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shape Completion and Real-Time Visualization in Robotic Ultrasound Spine Acquisitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08923v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency, reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup. Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a volunteer scan.</p></details> |  |

However, a key hurdle in achieving this goal lies in the robots' ability to manipulate objects in their unstructured surrounding environments according to different tasks. The learning-based approach is considered an effective way to address generalization. The impressive performance of foundation models in the fields of computer vision and natural language suggests the potential of embedding foundation models into manipulation tasks as a viable path toward achieving general manipulation capability. However, we believe achieving general manipulation capability requires an overarching framework akin to auto driving. This framework should encompass multiple functional modules, with different foundation models assuming distinct roles in facilitating general manipulation capability. This survey focuses on the contributions of foundation models to robot learning for manipulation. We propose a comprehensive framework and detail how foundation models can address challenges in each module of the framework. What's more, we examine current approaches, outline challenges, suggest future research directions, and identify potential risks associated with integrating foundation models into this domain.</p></details> |  |
