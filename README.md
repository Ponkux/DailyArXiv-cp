| **[psiUnity: A Platform for Multimodal Data-Driven XR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05304v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extended reality (XR) research increasingly relies on the ability to stream and synchronize multimodal data between headsets and immersive applications for data-driven interaction and experimentation. However, developers face a critical gap: the Platform for Situated Intelligence (psi), which excels at deterministic temporal alignment and multimodal data management, has been largely inaccessible to the dominant Unity/MRTK ecosystem used for HoloLens development. We introduce psiUnity, an open-source C# integration that bridges psi's .NET libraries with Unity 2022.3 and MRTK3 for HoloLens 2. psiUnity enables bidirectional, real-time streaming of head pose, hand tracking, gaze, IMU, audio, and depth sensor data (AHAT and long-throw) with microsecond-level temporal precision, allowing Unity applications to both consume and produce synchronized multimodal data streams. By embedding psi's native serialization, logging, and temporal coordination directly within Unity's architecture, psiUnity extends psi beyond its previous StereoKit limitations and empowers the HRI, HCI, and embodied-AI communities to develop reproducible, data-driven XR interactions and experiments within the familiar Unity environment. The integration is available at https://github.com/sailgt/psiUnity.</p></details> |  |
| **[iFlyBot-VLM Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04976v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce iFlyBot-VLM, a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (VLM) used to improve the domain of Embodied Intelligence. The central objective of iFlyBot-VLM is to bridge the cross-modal semantic gap between high-dimensional environmental perception and low-level robotic motion control. To this end, the model abstracts complex visual and spatial information into a body-agnostic and transferable Operational Language, thereby enabling seamless perception-action closed-loop coordination across diverse robotic platforms. The architecture of iFlyBot-VLM is systematically designed to realize four key functional capabilities essential for embodied intelligence: 1) Spatial Understanding and Metric Reasoning; 2) Interactive Target Grounding; 3) Action Abstraction and Control Parameter Generation; 4) Task Planning and Skill Sequencing. We envision iFlyBot-VLM as a scalable and generalizable foundation model for embodied AI, facilitating the progression from specialized task-oriented systems toward generalist, cognitively capable agents. We conducted evaluations on 10 current mainstream embodied intelligence-related VLM benchmark datasets, such as Blink and Where2Place, and achieved optimal performance while preserving the model's general capabilities. We will publicly release both the training data and model weights to foster further research and development in the field of Embodied Intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Action Deviation-Aware Inference for Low-Latency Wireless Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02851v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML with computational resources in mobile, edge, and cloud connected over hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: a lightweight on-device model locally generates drafts while a more capable remote target model on a server verifies and corrects them in parallel with speculative sampling, thus resulting in lower latency without compromising accuracy. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each generated action depends on observation updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference (ADAHI), wherein drafts are selectively transmitted and verified based on action deviation, which has a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model. By invoking server operation only when necessary, communication and computational overhead can be reduced while accuracy gain from speculative sampling is preserved. Experiments on our testbed show that ADAHI reduces transmission and server operations by approximately 40%, lowers end-to-end latency by 39.2%, and attains up to 97.2% of the task-success rate of baseline that invokes speculative sampling for every draft embedding vector.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysCorr: Dual-Reward DPO for Physics-Constrained Text-to-Video Generation with Automated Preference Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03997v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics, incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaRF: Enhancing Multi-View Consistency in Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03992v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically, CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization. Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively. Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and autonomous perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROSBag MCP Server: Analyzing Robot Data with LLMs for Agentic Embodied AI Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03497v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.

| **[EQ-Negotiator: Dynamic Emotional Personas Empower Small Language Models for Edge-Deployable Credit Negotiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03370v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in automated negotiation has set a high performance benchmark, but their computational cost and data privacy requirements render them unsuitable for many privacy-sensitive, on-device applications such as mobile assistants, embodied AI agents or private client interactions. While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative, they suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing emotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This paper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability gap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates game theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional states online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs with the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating conflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent simulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial debtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show that a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its size. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles to dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints. Besides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw model scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation, paving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators that can operate on the edge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02912v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), which uses the agent's own policy to simulate future states. A Message Generation Network (MGN) then compresses this plan into a message. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems, while scaling environmental complexity. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

| **[Learning Interactive World Model for Object-Centric Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02225v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents that understand objects and their interactions can learn policies that are more robust and transferable. However, most object-centric RL methods factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular interaction learning is crucial for robust control.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[URDF-Anything: Constructing Articulated Objects with 3D Multimodal Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00940v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing accurate digital twins of articulated objects is essential for robotic simulation training and embodied AI world model building, yet historically requires painstaking manual modeling or multi-stage pipelines. In this work, we propose \textbf{URDF-Anything}, an end-to-end automatic reconstruction framework based on a 3D multimodal large language model (MLLM). URDF-Anything utilizes an autoregressive prediction framework based on point-cloud and text multimodal input to jointly optimize geometric segmentation and kinematic parameter prediction. It implements a specialized $[SEG]$ token mechanism that interacts directly with point cloud features, enabling fine-grained part-level segmentation while maintaining consistency with the kinematic parameter predictions. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches regarding geometric segmentation (mIoU 17\% improvement), kinematic parameter prediction (average error reduction of 29\%), and physical executability (surpassing baselines by 50\%). Notably, our method exhibits excellent generalization ability, performing well even on objects outside the training set. This work provides an efficient solution for constructing digital twins for robotic simulation, significantly enhancing the sim-to-real transfer capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Spatial Reasoning in the Large Model Era: A Survey and Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25760v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However, systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space. We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated information about this survey, codes and implementation of the open benchmarks can be found at https://github.com/zhengxuJosh/Awesome-Spatial-Reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Modal Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Spatial Reasoning-Based Visual Grounding in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27033v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual reasoning, particularly spatial reasoning, is a challenging cognitive task that requires understanding object relationships and their interactions within complex environments, especially in robotics domain. Existing vision_language models (VLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning due to their implicit, correlation-driven reasoning and reliance solely on images. We propose a novel neuro_symbolic framework that integrates both panoramic-image and 3D point cloud information, combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning to explicitly model spatial and logical relationships. Our framework consists of a perception module for detecting entities and extracting attributes, and a reasoning module that constructs a structured scene graph to support precise, interpretable queries. Evaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, our approach demonstrates superior performance and reliability in crowded, human_built environments while maintaining a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[PoseDiff: A Unified Diffusion Model Bridging Robot Pose Estimation and Video-to-Action Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24591v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI. The video visualization results can be found on the project page: https://haozhuo-zhang.github.io/PoseDiff-project-page/.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The experimental setup and metrics lacks rigor, affecting the fairness of the comparisons</p></details> |
| **[SynHLMA:Synthesizing Hand Language Manipulation for Articulated Object with Discrete Human Object Interaction Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25268v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating hand grasps with language instructions is a widely studied topic that benefits from embodied AI and VR/AR applications. While transferring into hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[SceneWeaver: All-in-One 3D Scene Synthesis with an Extensible and Self-Reflective Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20414v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

| **[Two-Steps Diffusion Policy for Robotic Manipulation via Genetic Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21991v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, such as diffusion policy, have achieved state-of-the-art results in robotic manipulation by imitating expert demonstrations. While diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and video generation, many of their inference strategies have been directly transferred to control domains without adaptation. In this work, we show that by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied AI tasks -- particularly structured, low-dimensional nature of action distributions -- diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as 5 neural function evaluations (NFE). Building on this insight, we propose a population-based sampling strategy, genetic denoising, which enhances both performance and stability by selecting denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk. Our method solves challenging tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. We evaluate our approach across 14 robotic manipulation tasks from D4RL and Robomimic, spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets. In over 2 million evaluations, our method consistently outperforms standard diffusion-based policies, achieving up to 20\% performance gains with significantly fewer inference steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figure, 2 tables, accepted at Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[MEReQ: Max-Ent Residual-Q Inverse RL for Sample-Efficient Alignment from Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16258v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning robot behavior with human preferences is crucial for deploying embodied AI agents in human-centered environments. A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmbodiedBrain: Expanding Performance Boundaries of Task Planning for Embodied Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20578v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model (GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency. For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks, highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data, model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at https://zterobot.github.io/EmbodiedBrain.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05341v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://directlayout.github.io/</p></details> |

World simulators provide such environments but face distinct limitations: video-based methods generate diverse content but lack real-time physics feedback for interactive learning, while physics-based engines provide accurate dynamics but face scalability limitations from costly manual asset creation. We present Seed3D 1.0, a foundation model that generates simulation-ready 3D assets from single images, addressing the scalability challenge while maintaining physics rigor. Unlike existing 3D generation models, our system produces assets with accurate geometry, well-aligned textures, and realistic physically-based materials. These assets can be directly integrated into physics engines with minimal configuration, enabling deployment in robotic manipulation and simulation training. Beyond individual objects, the system scales to complete scene generation through assembling objects into coherent environments. By enabling scalable simulation-ready content creation, Seed3D 1.0 provides a foundation for advancing physics-based world simulators.

They also serve as the foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project and benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/MV-RoboBench</p></details> |
| **[Seeing through Uncertainty: Robust Task-Oriented Optimization in Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00441v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual navigation is a fundamental problem in embodied AI, yet practical deployments demand long-horizon planning capabilities to address multi-objective tasks. A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned from limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural network-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that paradoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper introduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization. Specifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it transforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal calibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii) it reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization problem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments. Extensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation tasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in generalization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIKI-R: Coordinating Embodied Multi-Agent Cooperation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09049v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://faceong.github.io/VIKI-R/</p></details> |
| **[3D Audio-Visual Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02236v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing the sounding objects in scenes is a longstanding objective in embodied AI, with diverse applications in robotics and AR/VR/MR. To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

| **[Bridging Embodiment Gaps: Deploying Vision-Language-Action Models on Soft Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17369v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic systems are increasingly expected to operate in human-centered, unstructured environments where safety, adaptability, and generalization are essential. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been proposed as a language guided generalized control framework for real robots. However, their deployment has been limited to conventional serial link manipulators. Coupled by their rigidity and unpredictability of learning based control, the ability to safely interact with the environment is missing yet critical. In this work, we present the deployment of a VLA model on a soft continuum manipulator to demonstrate autonomous safe human-robot interaction. We present a structured finetuning and deployment pipeline evaluating two state-of-the-art VLA models (OpenVLA-OFT and $\pi_0$) across representative manipulation tasks, and show while out-of-the-box policies fail due to embodiment mismatch, through targeted finetuning the soft robot performs equally to the rigid counterpart. Our findings highlight the necessity of finetuning for bridging embodiment gaps, and demonstrate that coupling VLA models with soft robots enables safe and flexible embodied AI in human-shared environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 SpaVLE workshop. 4 pages, 2 figures(in main paper, excluding references and supplements)</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has led to a growing demand for AI-enabled wireless networks. The open-source DeepSeek models are famous for their innovative designs, such as large-scale pure RL and cost-efficient training, which make them well-suited for practical deployment in wireless networks. By integrating DeepSeek-style LLMs with wireless infrastructures, a synergistic opportunity arises: the DeepSeek-style LLMs enhance network optimization with strong reasoning and decision-making abilities, while wireless infrastructure enables the broad deployment of these models. Motivated by this convergence, this survey presents a comprehensive DeepSeek-inspired exploration of RL-based LLMs in the context of wireless networks. We begin by reviewing key techniques behind network optimization to establish a foundation for understanding DeepSeek-style LLM integration. Next, we examine recent advancements in RL-based LLMs, using DeepSeek models as a representative example. Building on this, we explore the synergy between the two domains, highlighting motivations, challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we highlight emerging directions for integrating LLMs with wireless networks, such as quantum, on-device, and neural-symbolic LLM models, as well as embodied AI agents. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive examination of the interplay between DeepSeek-style LLMs and wireless networks, demonstrating how these domains can mutually enhance each other to drive innovation.</p></details> | 45 pages, 12 figures |

World models serve as internal simulators that capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2) Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges, including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal consistency while mitigating error accumulation.

| **[Elevating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs with Visual Embedding Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09585v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, the standard practice for developing MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/visper_lm/</p></details> |

Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware, interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Project Page: https://cl-splats.github.io</p></details> |

| **[SPORTS: Simultaneous Panoptic Odometry, Rendering, Tracking and Segmentation for Urban Scenes Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12749v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity, and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> |
| **[ERA: Transforming VLMs into Embodied Agents via Embodied Prior Learning and Online Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12693v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2) Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of 8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for future embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Quality Assessment for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16815v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI has developed rapidly in recent years, but it is still mainly deployed in laboratories, with various distortions in the Real-world limiting its application. Traditionally, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are applied to predict human preferences for distorted images; however, there is no IQA method to assess the usability of an image in embodied tasks, namely, the perceptual quality for robots. To provide accurate and reliable quality indicators for future embodied scenarios, we first propose the topic: IQA for Embodied AI. Specifically, we (1) based on the Mertonian system and meta-cognitive theory, constructed a perception-cognition-decision-execution pipeline and defined a comprehensive subjective score collection process; (2) established the Embodied-IQA database, containing over 36k reference/distorted image pairs, with more than 5m fine-grained annotations provided by Vision Language Models/Vision Language Action-models/Real-world robots; (3) trained and validated the performance of mainstream IQA methods on Embodied-IQA, demonstrating the need to develop more accurate quality indicators for Embodied AI. We sincerely hope that through evaluation, we can promote the application of Embodied AI under complex distortions in the Real-world.

However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond 'Templates': Category-Agnostic Object Pose, Size, and Shape Estimation from a Single View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11687v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL, spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D understanding in robotics and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy. For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables, NeurIPS 2025 Camera Ready Version (oral)</p></details> |

However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall, our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied tasks.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Although recent advances in simulation platforms have greatly enhanced task diversity to train embodied Vision Language Models (VLMs), most platforms rely on simplified robot morphologies and bypass the stochastic nature of low-level execution, which limits their transferability to real-world robots. To address these issues, we present a physics-based simulation platform DualTHOR for complex dual-arm humanoid robots, built upon an extended version of AI2-THOR. Our simulator includes real-world robot assets, a task suite for dual-arm collaboration, and inverse kinematics solvers for humanoid robots. We also introduce a contingency mechanism that incorporates potential failures through physics-based low-level execution, bridging the gap to real-world scenarios. Our simulator enables a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness and generalization of VLMs in household environments. Extensive evaluations reveal that current VLMs struggle with dual-arm coordination and exhibit limited robustness in realistic environments with contingencies, highlighting the importance of using our simulator to develop more capable VLMs for embodied tasks.

We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[TabVLA: Targeted Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10932v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing deployment of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in real-world embodied AI systems, their increasing vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses a serious safety threat. A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly triggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions, potentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor attacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on untargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of targeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor attacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such attacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant inference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve attack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal that the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors succeed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger design, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and inference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense against TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream to flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the vulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores the need for more advanced defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 tables, 1 figure.

FormCoach transforms a simple camera into an always-on, interactive AI training partner, capable of spotting subtle form errors and delivering tailored corrections in real time, leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems.

In a grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop, plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search, belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Unlike previous surveys that often focus on specific modalities or limited fusion strategies, our work presents a structure-centric and method-driven framework that emphasizes generalizable techniques. We systematically categorize and analyze key approaches to alignment and fusion through both structural perspectives -- data-level, feature-level, and output-level fusion -- and methodological paradigms -- including statistical, kernel-based, graphical, generative, contrastive, attention-based, and large language model (LLM)-based methods, drawing insights from an extensive review of over 260 relevant studies. Furthermore, this survey highlights critical challenges such as cross-modal misalignment, computational bottlenecks, data quality issues, and the modality gap, along with recent efforts to address them. Applications ranging from social media analysis and medical imaging to emotion recognition and embodied AI are explored to illustrate the real-world impact of robust multimodal systems. The insights provided aim to guide future research toward optimizing multimodal learning systems for improved scalability, robustness, and generalizability across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCV 2025</p></details> |

For any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs. It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source, specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

These aspects are critical for embodied AI, where agents must act under uncertainty and delayed perception. We introduce FOGMACHINE , an open-source framework that fuses DSGs with discrete-event simulation to model object dynamics, agent observations, and interactions at scale. This setup enables the study of uncertainty propagation, planning under limited perception, and emergent multi-agent behavior. Experiments in urban scenarios illustrate realistic temporal and spatial patterns while revealing the challenges of belief estimation under sparse observations. By combining structured representations with efficient simulation, FOGMACHINE establishes an effective tool for benchmarking, model training, and advancing embodied AI in complex, uncertain environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the IEEE for possible publication; 8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Goal-oriented Backdoor Attack against Vision-Language-Action Models via Physical Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09269v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have greatly improved embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers. Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions. In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and BadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at https://goba-attack.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTR-Bench: Evaluating Geo-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07791v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

While recent studies leverage visual or textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain. Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise, prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D affordance segmentation.</p></details> | Work in process |

While current learning tools show promise for speaking practice, most focus on dyadic, scripted scenarios, limiting opportunities for dynamic group interactions. To address this gap, we present ConversAR, a Mixed Reality system that leverages Generative AI and XR to support situated and personalized group conversations. It integrates embodied AI agents, scene recognition, and generative 3D props anchored to real-world surroundings. Based on a formative study with experts in language acquisition, we developed and tested this system with a user study with 21 second-language learners. Results indicate that the system enhanced learner engagement, increased willingness to communicate, and offered a safe space for speaking. We discuss the implications for integrating Generative AI and XR into the design of future language learning applications.</p></details> | 22 pages |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in semantic reasoning and task planning, a significant gap persists between their high-level understanding and the precise physical execution required for real-world manipulation. To bridge this "semantic-to-physical" gap, we introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world environments, without requiring task-specific training.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, submitted for ICLR 2026 conference</p></details> |

However, their robustness to natural language variability in real-world scenarios has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a novel systematic study of the robustness of state-of-the-art VLA models under linguistic perturbations. Specifically, we evaluate model performance under two types of instruction noise: (1) human-generated paraphrasing and (2) the addition of irrelevant context. We further categorize irrelevant contexts into two groups according to their length and their semantic and lexical proximity to robot commands. In this study, we observe consistent performance degradation as context size expands. We also demonstrate that the model can exhibit relative robustness to random context, with a performance drop within 10%, while semantically and lexically similar context of the same length can trigger a quality decline of around 50%. Human paraphrases of instructions lead to a drop of nearly 20%. To mitigate this, we propose an LLM-based filtering framework that extracts core commands from noisy inputs. Incorporating our filtering step allows models to recover up to 98.5% of their original performance under noisy conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Safety Challenge of World Models for Embodied AI Agents: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05865v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret, and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a quantitative evaluation of the results.</p></details> |  |

Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative: they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction, enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation. Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at https://worv-ai.github.io/d2e/</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 17 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

These models have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark, VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation. Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.</p></details> | We are revising it |

Despite the rapid progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation. It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs, mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions, conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, Project Page:https://hyelinnam.github.io/Cameo/</p></details> |

This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making.

Furthermore, we extend our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system.

However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1.

To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions.

These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete. Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models, provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand, advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility, dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers.

An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

However, existing interactive segmentation methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained, multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new 3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale, scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines, PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency.

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Embodied Planning with Verifiable Reward for Real-World Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25852v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the planner. We will open-source both the dataset and the trained model upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning with Vision-Language Models in Ego-Centric Multi-View Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06266v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-and-Language Navigation with Analogical Textual Descriptions in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25139v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions. We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in navigation performance.</p></details> |  |

Yet prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge; and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders, suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability. Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time, and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across four public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a poster in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Intentional Gesture: Deliver Your Intentions with Gestures for Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15197v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When humans speak, gestures help convey communicative intentions, such as adding emphasis or describing concepts. However, current co-speech gesture generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (e.g. speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To address this gap, we introduce Intentional-Gesture, a novel framework that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in high-level communicative functions. First, we curate the InG dataset by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (i.e., text sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the Intentional Gesture Motion Tokenizer to leverage these intention annotations. It injects high-level communicative functions (e.g., intentions) into tokenized motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture</p></details> |  |
| **[Can AI Perceive Physical Danger and Intervene?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21651v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent -- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions. The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at https://asimov-benchmark.github.io/v2</p></details> |  |
| **[iTACO: Interactable Digital Twins of Articulated Objects from Casually Captured RGBD Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08334v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Interactable digital twins of such objects have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. Unfortunately, current methods to digitize articulated real-world objects require carefully captured data, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable acquisition. We focus on motion analysis and part-level segmentation of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to obtain at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is challenging due to simultaneous object and camera motion and significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iTACO: a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories that is 20$\times$ larger than available in prior work. We then compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Our experiments show that iTACO outperforms existing articulated object digital twin methods on both synthetic and real casually captured RGBD videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website can be found at https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/video2articulation/</p></details> |
| **[Embodied AI: From LLMs to World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20021v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models (WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building internal representations and future predictions of the external world, facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances, covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e., embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs, meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE CASM</p></details> |
| **[PersONAL: Towards a Comprehensive Benchmark for Personalized Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19843v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Embodied AI have enabled agents to perform increasingly complex tasks and adapt to diverse environments. However, deploying such agents in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes. Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards real-world assistive robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plan Verification for LLM-Based Embodied Task Completion Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02761v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions, redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout). The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25 fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view), providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially, we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the leaderboards of Embodied Arena. This helps to establish clear research veins and pinpoint critical research problems, thereby driving forward progress in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, Embodied Arena Technical Report</p></details> |

Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmbodiedSplat: Personalized Real-to-Sim-to-Real Navigation with Gaussian Splats from a Mobile Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17430v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Embodied AI predominantly relies on simulation for training and evaluation, often using either fully synthetic environments that lack photorealism or high-fidelity real-world reconstructions captured with expensive hardware. As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate improvements of 20% and 40% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover, our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87-0.97) for the reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to diverse environments with minimal effort.

| **[Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16176v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories (ACDC), an autonomous drone cinematography system driven by natural language communication between human directors and drones. The main limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent, which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models (VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emulating Human-like Adaptive Vision for Efficient and Flexible Machine Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15333v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition.

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

To overcome these obstacles, we propose RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pku-epic.github.io/NavFoM-Web/</p></details> |

For example, such knowledge directs an agent to grasp a knife by the handle for cutting or by the blade for safe handover. While existing approaches have made notable progress, affordance research still faces three key challenges: data scarcity, poor generalization, and real-world deployment. Specifically, there is a lack of large-scale affordance datasets with precise segmentation maps, existing models struggle to generalize across different domains or novel object and affordance classes, and little work demonstrates deployability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a complete affordance learning system that (1) takes in egocentric videos and outputs precise affordance annotations without human labeling, (2) leverages geometric information and vision foundation models to improve generalization, and (3) introduces a framework that facilitates affordance-oriented robotic manipulation such as tool grasping and robot-to-human tool handover. Experimental results show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by 13.8% in mIoU, and the framework achieves 77.1% successful grasping among 179 trials, including evaluations on seen, unseen classes, and cluttered scenes.

| **[Integrating Prior Observations for Incremental 3D Scene Graph Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11895v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships. While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world, incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g., CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented architecture will be made available at https://github.com/m4renz/incremental-scene-graph-prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 24th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'25)</p></details> |

It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents.

Existing approaches often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought (CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format, understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its robustness under limited onboard resources. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/Nav-R1.

| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v6)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |

Traditional sequential computation patterns, while effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by 2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and providing high throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling.

Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://aopolin-lv.github.io/F1-VLA/</p></details> |

World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

Several previous studies have tried to enhance the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities. To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning 19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeSearch-R: Adaptive Temporal Search for Long-Form Video Understanding via Self-Verification Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05489v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL). However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV, filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably, TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1% improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video reasoning model Video-R1.

| **[Ethics-Aware Safe Reinforcement Learning for Rare-Event Risk Control in Interactive Urban Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14926v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on embedding credible and transparent ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers, particularly to protect vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists. Here, we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that augments standard driving objectives with ethics-aware cost signals. At the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level motion targets. A dynamic, risk-sensitive Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level, polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our approach on closed-loop simulation environments derived from large-scale, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods in reducing risk to others while maintaining ego performance and comfort. This work provides a reproducible benchmark for Safe RL with explicitly ethics-aware objectives in human-mixed traffic scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically accountable autonomy that explicitly protects those most at risk in urban traffic environments. Across two interactive benchmarks and five random seeds, our policy decreases conflict frequency by 25-45% compared to matched task successes while maintaining comfort metrics within 5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Approximation with Unbounded Markovian Noise: A General-Purpose Theorem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21704v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by engineering applications such as resource allocation in networks and inventory systems, we consider average-reward Reinforcement Learning with unbounded state space and reward function. Recent works studied this problem in the actor-critic framework and established finite sample bounds assuming access to a critic with certain error guarantees. We complement their work by studying Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation and establishing finite-time bounds with the optimal $\mathcal{O}\left(1/\epsilon^2\right)$ sample complexity. These results are obtained using the following general-purpose theorem for non-linear Stochastic Approximation (SA). Suppose that one constructs a Lyapunov function for a non-linear SA with certain drift condition. Then, our theorem establishes finite-time bounds when this SA is driven by unbounded Markovian noise under suitable conditions. It serves as a black box tool to generalize sample guarantees on SA from i.i.d. or martingale difference case to potentially unbounded Markovian noise. The generality and the mild assumption of the setup enables broad applicability of our theorem. We illustrate its power by studying two more systems: (i) We improve upon the finite-time bounds of $Q$-learning by tightening the error bounds and also allowing for a larger class of behavior policies. (ii) We establish the first ever finite-time bounds for distributed stochastic optimization of high-dimensional smooth strongly convex function using cyclic block coordinate descent.</p></details> |  |

When the same response strategy is applied across users, minority users may assign different satisfaction ratings than majority users due to variations in individual intents and preferences. However, existing alignment methods typically train one-size-fits-all models that aim for broad consensus, often overlooking minority perspectives and user-specific adaptation. We propose a unified framework that models both individual- and group-level preferences for user satisfaction estimation. First, we introduce Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning (CoPeR) to capture individual preferences through interpretable reasoning chains. Second, we propose an expectation-maximization-based Majority-Minority Preference-Aware Clustering (M2PC) algorithm that discovers distinct user groups in an unsupervised manner to learn group-level preferences. Finally, we integrate these components into a preference-adaptive reinforcement learning framework (PAda-PPO) that jointly optimizes alignment with both individual and group preferences. Experiments on the Emotional Support Conversation dataset demonstrate consistent improvements in user satisfaction estimation, particularly for underrepresented user groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCNL...</summary><p>IJCNLP-AACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |
| **[Sample Complexity of Distributionally Robust Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning with Online Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05396v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment transition dynamics are different, can be formulated as learning in a robust Markov decision process (RMDP) where uncertainties in transition dynamics are imposed. Existing literature mostly assumes access to generative models allowing arbitrary state-action queries or pre-collected datasets with a good state coverage of the deployment environment, bypassing the challenge of exploration. In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting where the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment. To capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we introduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the mismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show that if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear regret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We also establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm achieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the number of interaction episodes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through comprehensive numerical experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables.

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and 28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5 VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30% and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues underlying quality judgments.

While recent breakthroughs have matched elite human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued: most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies, randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class human players.</p></details> |  |
| **[TeaRAG: A Token-Efficient Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05385v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) utilizes external knowledge to augment Large Language Models' (LLMs) reliability. For flexibility, agentic RAG employs autonomous, multi-round retrieval and reasoning to resolve queries. Although recent agentic RAG has improved via reinforcement learning, they often incur substantial token overhead from search and reasoning processes. This trade-off prioritizes accuracy over efficiency. To address this issue, this work proposes TeaRAG, a token-efficient agentic RAG framework capable of compressing both retrieval content and reasoning steps. 1) First, the retrieved content is compressed by augmenting chunk-based semantic retrieval with a graph retrieval using concise triplets. A knowledge association graph is then built from semantic similarity and co-occurrence. Finally, Personalized PageRank is leveraged to highlight key knowledge within this graph, reducing the number of tokens per retrieval. 2) Besides, to reduce reasoning steps, Iterative Process-aware Direct Preference Optimization (IP-DPO) is proposed. Specifically, our reward function evaluates the knowledge sufficiency by a knowledge matching mechanism, while penalizing excessive reasoning steps. This design can produce high-quality preference-pair datasets, supporting iterative DPO to improve reasoning conciseness. Across six datasets, TeaRAG improves the average Exact Match by 4% and 2% while reducing output tokens by 61% and 59% on Llama3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/TeaRAG.</p></details> | 32 pages |

However, GR often struggles to generalize and is costly to scale. We introduce QUESTER (QUEry SpecificaTion gEnerative Retrieval), which reframes GR as query specification generation - in this work, a simple keyword query handled by BM25 - using a (small) LLM. The policy is trained using reinforcement learning techniques (GRPO). Across in- and out-of-domain evaluations, we show that our model is more effective than BM25, and competitive with neural IR models, while maintaining a good efficiency</p></details> |  |
| **[Reflective Personalization Optimization: A Post-hoc Rewriting Framework for Black-Box Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05286v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The personalization of black-box large language models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging task. Existing approaches predominantly rely on context injection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the generation process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on the model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with user-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output quality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we propose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that redefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from alignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a high-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly rewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection module is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning is employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core personalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to user-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to further refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs. Comprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by decoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of explicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO introduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be seamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new and effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation. We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding, mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2 exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks.

| **[An End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05265v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of truck-drone collaborative systems in last-mile logistics has positioned the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D) as a pivotal extension of classical routing optimization, where synchronized vehicle coordination promises substantial operational efficiency and reduced environmental impact, yet introduces NP-hard combinatorial complexity beyond the reach of conventional optimization paradigms. Deep reinforcement learning offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel, optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm. Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales (N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods. Moreover, compared to advanced reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarks, the proposed framework significantly reduces the total training time required while achieving superior final performance, highlighting its notable advantage in training efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergence from Emergence: Financial Market Simulation via Learning with Heterogeneous Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05207v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-based models help explain stock price dynamics as emergent phenomena driven by interacting investors. In this modeling tradition, investor behavior has typically been captured by two distinct mechanisms -- learning and heterogeneous preferences -- which have been explored as separate paradigms in prior studies. However, the impact of their joint modeling on the resulting collective dynamics remains largely unexplored. We develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework in which agents endowed with heterogeneous risk aversion, time discounting, and information access collectively learn trading strategies within a unified shared-policy framework. The experiment reveals that (i) learning with heterogeneous preferences drives agents to develop strategies aligned with their individual traits, fostering behavioral differentiation and niche specialization within the market, and (ii) the interactions by the differentiated agents are essential for the emergence of realistic market dynamics such as fat-tailed price fluctuations and volatility clustering. This study presents a constructive paradigm for financial market modeling in which the joint design of heterogeneous preferences and learning mechanisms enables two-stage emergence: individual behavior and the collective market dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-probability Tokens Sustain Exploration in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03222v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses, signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of \textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy RL, sustaining continuous scaling across $3,000$ training steps and $81,204$ GPU-hours, where baseline entropy-control methods collapse. This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a $60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$ over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.</p></details> |  |

Its advanced capabilities are cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start training strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and equips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning. Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result, LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5% (from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems and agentic AI research.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we first construct HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of adverse weather scenarios.

| **[FM4Com: Foundation Model for Scene-Adaptive Communication Strategy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05094v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks heralds an intelligent communication ecosystem driven by AI-native air interfaces. However, current physical-layer designs-typically following modular and isolated optimization paradigms-fail to achieve global end-to-end optimality due to neglected inter-module dependencies. Although large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to communication tasks such as beam prediction and resource allocation, existing studies remain limited to single-task or single-modality scenarios and lack the ability to jointly reason over communication states and user intents for personalized strategy adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel multimodal communication decision-making model based on reinforcement learning. The proposed model semantically aligns channel state information (CSI) and textual user instructions, enabling comprehensive understanding of both physical-layer conditions and communication intents. It then generates physically realizable, user-customized link construction strategies that dynamically adapt to changing environments and preference tendencies. A two-stage reinforcement learning framework is employed: the first stage expands the experience pool via heuristic exploration and behavior cloning to obtain a near-optimal initialization, while the second stage fine-tunes the model through multi-objective reinforcement learning considering bit error rate, throughput, and complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms conventional planning-based algorithms under challenging channel conditions, achieving robust, efficient, and personalized 6G link construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diverse Mini-Batch Selection in Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Chemical Exploration in de novo Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21158v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world applications, evaluating the quality of instances is costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations, in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more critical in reinforcement learning, since it relies on interactions with the environment (i.e., new instances) that must be evaluated to provide a reward signal for learning. At the same time, performing sufficient exploration is crucial in reinforcement learning to find high-rewarding solutions, meaning that the agent should observe and learn from a diverse set of experiences to find different solutions. Thus, we argue that learning from a diverse mini-batch of experiences can have a large impact on the exploration and help mitigate mode collapse.In this paper, we introduce mini-batch diversification for reinforcement learning and study this framework in the context of a real-world problem, namely, drug discovery. We extensively evaluate how our proposed framework can enhance the effectiveness of chemical exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality solutions is crucial. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed diverse mini-batch selection framework can substantially enhance the diversity of solutions while maintaining high-quality solutions. In drug discovery, such an outcome can potentially lead to fulfilling unmet medical needs faster.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRQA: Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation for Controlling Overthinking in Reasoning Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17803v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O3 and DeepSeek-R1, have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities by performing structured and multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer from overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even for simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational inefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions in batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically compressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource competition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation (DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from batch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model to allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to internalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA enables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining sufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on a wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many cases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking problem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable deployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into fine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Anytime Reasoning via Budget Relative Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13438v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling test-time compute is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically employ reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions, enhancing both training and token efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[AURA: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for AI-Driven Adaptive Conversational Surveys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27126v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional online surveys provide limited personalization, often resulting in low engagement and superficial responses. Although AI survey chatbots improve convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees or static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit individual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality. We address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through Reinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for AI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality using a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and Specificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy that updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with priors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total chatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation across 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual participants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.076 mean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over non-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in specification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning can give survey chatbots improved adaptivity, transforming static questionnaires into interactive, self-improving assessment systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Coordination via Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05005v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents MAC-Flow, a simple yet expressive framework for multi-agent coordination. We argue that requirements of effective coordination are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However, prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and $34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and computational cost, specifically achieving about $\boldsymbol{\times14.5}$ faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent. Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under challenging manipulation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEME: Open Large Language Models for Ophthalmology with Advanced Reasoning and Clinical Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03740v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising prevalence of eye diseases poses a growing public health burden. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path to reduce documentation workload and support clinical decision-making. However, few have been tailored for ophthalmology, and most evaluations focus mainly on knowledge-based QA without clinically relevant benchmarks or real-world validation. Here, we present LEME, a suite of open-weight LLMs developed through a two-stage process: (1) instruction tuning on 200,000 samples from clinical guidelines, textbooks, and case reports to enhance reasoning and task-following, and (2) reinforcement learning with ~30,000 preference labels to enhance accuracy and informativeness. LEME was evaluated on five curated zero-shot benchmarks spanning tasks such as patient QA, consultation, and treatment planning. It outperformed all seven baselines (all p < 0.004), exceeding GPT-4o by 3.32% (absolute ROUGE-L gain). It was further evaluated on three downstream tasks using deidentified patient data, reviewed by clinicians. In patient QA, LEME received the highest ratings from attending clinicians in 3 out of 4 criteria, with scores of 4.67 for factuality, 4.77 for specificity, 4.79 for completeness, and 4.88 for safety (1-5 scale). Its completeness score surpassed that of expert-written answers (4.79 vs. 4.56; p = 0.015). In visual acuity extraction, LEME achieved the highest F1, outperforming LLaMA-3 by 14.1% and Eye-LLaMA by 59.0%. In a pilot evaluation on assessment and treatment planning for diabetic retinopathy, AMD, and glaucoma, LEME received scores of 4.36 for factuality, 4.55 for specificity, 4.42 for completeness, and 4.36 for safety, approaching attending-level performance. All models, data, and code will be released to support further development and clinical translation, laying the groundwork for improved efficiency and patient care</p></details> |  |
| **[L2T-Tune:LLM-Guided Hybrid Database Tuning with LHS and TD3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01602v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Configuration tuning is critical for database performance. Although recent advancements in database tuning have shown promising results in throughput and latency improvement, challenges remain. First, the vast knob space makes direct optimization unstable and slow to converge. Second, reinforcement learning pipelines often lack effective warm-start guidance and require long offline training. Third, transferability is limited: when hardware or workloads change, existing models typically require substantial retraining to recover performance. To address these limitations, we propose L2T-Tune, a new LLM-guided hybrid database tuning framework that features a three-stage pipeline: Stage one performs a warm start that simultaneously generates uniform samples across the knob space and logs them into a shared pool; Stage two leverages a large language model to mine and prioritize tuning hints from manuals and community documents for rapid convergence. Stage three uses the warm-start sample pool to reduce the dimensionality of knobs and state features, then fine-tunes the configuration with the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. We conduct experiments on L2T-Tune and the state-of-the-art models. Compared with the best-performing alternative, our approach improves performance by an average of 37.1% across all workloads, and by up to 73% on TPC-C. Compared with models trained with reinforcement learning, it achieves rapid convergence in the offline tuning stage on a single server. Moreover, during the online tuning stage, it only takes 30 steps to achieve best results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Periodic Skill Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03187v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn diverse behaviors without relying on external rewards. However, current methods often overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on increasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the distance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks - particularly those involving locomotion - require periodic behaviors across varying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is essential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a framework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key idea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space, thereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By capturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse periods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We further show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream tasks such as hurdling. Moreover, integrating PSD with an existing skill discovery method offers more diverse behaviors, thus broadening the agent's repertoire. Our code and demos are available at https://jonghaepark.github.io/psd/</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, existing benchmarks often target narrow short-horizon challenges that do not adequately stress the long-term dependencies and generalization capabilities inherent in many multi-agent systems. To address this, we first present \textit{Craftax-MA}: an extension of the popular open-ended RL environment, Craftax, that supports multiple agents and evaluates a wide range of general abilities within a single environment. Written in JAX, \textit{Craftax-MA} is exceptionally fast with a training run using 250 million environment interactions completing in under an hour. To provide a more compelling challenge for MARL, we also present \textit{Craftax-Coop}, an extension introducing heterogeneous agents, trading and more mechanics that require complex cooperation among agents for success. We provide analysis demonstrating that existing algorithms struggle with key challenges in this benchmark, including long-horizon credit assignment, exploration and cooperation, and argue for its potential to drive long-term research in MARL.</p></details> |  |

Over the decades, a wide range of statistical methodologies have been developed to address the complexities of clinical trial data, including parametric, nonparametric, Bayesian, and machine learning approaches. Parametric methods, such as t-tests, ANOVA, and LMMs, have traditionally been the foundation of efficacy testing due to their efficiency under well-defined assumptions. Nonparametric techniques, including the Friedman test, Brunner-Munzel test, and modern extensions like nparLD, have emerged as robust alternatives, particularly for skewed, ordinal, or non-normal data. Bayesian methodologies have enabled the incorporation of prior information and uncertainty quantification, while machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, are revolutionizing trial designs and outcome predictions. Despite these advancements, significant gaps remain, including challenges in handling high-dimensional data, missingness, and ensuring equitable efficacy testing across diverse populations. This review provides a comprehensive overview of these statistical methods, highlighting their applications, strengths, limitations, and future directions. By bridging traditional statistical frameworks with modern computational techniques, the field can continue to advance toward more reliable and personalized clinical trial methodologies.</p></details> |  |

However, the generalizability of these label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning capabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and reasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals critical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below baseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate sufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective self-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in determining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to progressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority rollouts during training. Additionally, we introduce a data curation pipeline to generate samples with predefined difficulty. Our approach demonstrates consistent improvements across all model sizes and reasoning capabilities, providing a path toward more robust unsupervised RL that can bootstrap reasoning abilities in resource-constrained models.

Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can be deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating system-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the benefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to all driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives. Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates the robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the emergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based on simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging advanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.</p></details> |  |

Traditional forecasting models often fail to maintain consistent accuracy due to unpredictable fluctuations and concept drift driven by seasonal variations and natural disasters such as hurricanes in the Southeastern U.S. and wildfires in the West Coast. To address these challenges, we propose FoodRL, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based metalearning framework that clusters and dynamically weights diverse forecasting models based on recent performance and contextual information. Evaluated on multi-year data from two structurally distinct U.S. food banks-one large regional West Coast food bank affected by wildfires and another state-level East Coast food bank consistently impacted by hurricanes, FoodRL consistently outperforms baseline methods, particularly during periods of disruption or decline. By delivering more reliable and adaptive forecasts, FoodRL can facilitate the redistribution of food equivalent to 1.7 million additional meals annually, demonstrating its significant potential for social impact as well as adaptive ensemble learning for humanitarian supply chains.</p></details> |  |

By combining exponential-family priors over visible units with quantum Boltzmann distributions over hidden units, CSQBMs yield a hybrid quantum-classical model that reduces qubit requirements while retaining strong expressiveness. Crucially, gradients with respect to continuous variables can be computed analytically, enabling direct integration into Actor-Critic algorithms. Building on this, we propose a continuous Q-learning framework that replaces global maximization by efficient sampling from the CSQBM distribution, thereby overcoming instability issues in continuous control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explore Data Left Behind in Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04800v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an effective approach for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) family has demonstrated strong performance in training LLMs with RLVR. However, as models train longer and scale larger, more training prompts become residual prompts, those with zero variance rewards that provide no training signal. Consequently, fewer prompts contribute to training, reducing diversity and hindering effectiveness. To fully exploit these residual prompts, we propose the Explore Residual Prompts in Policy Optimization (ERPO) framework, which encourages exploration on residual prompts and reactivates their training signals. ERPO maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adaptively increases the sampling temperature for residual prompts that previously produced all correct responses. This encourages the model to generate more diverse reasoning traces, introducing incorrect responses that revive training signals. Empirical results on the Qwen2.5 series demonstrate that ERPO consistently surpasses strong baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, most recent reinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress external forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically restricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme forces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a framework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking policy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based formulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing against surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human motion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse interaction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable force thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the Unitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance, including gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object manipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak contact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more natural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots that can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Home ...</summary><p>Home page: https://gentle-humanoid.axell.top</p></details> |
| **[Forgetting is Everywhere](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04666v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression, generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and improving the information retention capabilities of general learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ben-sanati.github.io/forgetting-is-everywhere-project/</p></details> |

We show that an agent can learn to solve tasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training times comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is independent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method is environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others, leading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our experiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and stabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any observations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior to specific use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages without cover, references and supplementary materials, 11 with.

(2024), Comput. Chem. Eng. 190), Koopman surrogate models can be trained for optimal performance in specific (economic) nonlinear model predictive control ((e)NMPC) applications. So far, our method has exclusively been demonstrated on a small-scale case study. Herein, we show that our method scales well to a more challenging demand response case study built on a large-scale model of a single-product (nitrogen) air separation unit. Across all numerical experiments, we assume observability of only a few realistically measurable plant variables. Compared to a purely system identification-based Koopman eNMPC, which generates small economic savings but frequently violates constraints, our method delivers similar economic performance while avoiding constraint violations.</p></details> | <details><summary>manus...</summary><p>manuscript (8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table), supplementary materials (5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table)</p></details> |

Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs. To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1) a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing image-interactive reasoning applications.</p></details> | Working in progress |
| **[Fitting Reinforcement Learning Model to Behavioral Data under Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04454v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of fitting a reinforcement learning (RL) model to some given behavioral data under a multi-armed bandit environment. These models have received much attention in recent years for characterizing human and animal decision making behavior. We provide a generic mathematical optimization problem formulation for the fitting problem of a wide range of RL models that appear frequently in scientific research applications, followed by a detailed theoretical analysis of its convexity properties. Based on the theoretical results, we introduce a novel solution method for the fitting problem of RL models based on convex relaxation and optimization. Our method is then evaluated in several simulated bandit environments to compare with some benchmark methods that appear in the literature. Numerical results indicate that our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, while significantly reducing computation time. We also provide an open-source Python package for our proposed method to empower researchers to apply it in the analysis of their datasets directly, without prior knowledge of convex optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Communication Skills in Multi-task Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03348v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), agents can communicate with one another to perform a task in a coordinated manner. When multiple tasks are involved, agents can also leverage knowledge from one task to improve learning in other tasks. In this paper, we propose Multi-task Communication Skills (MCS), a MADRL with communication method that learns and performs multiple tasks simultaneously, with agents interacting through learnable communication protocols. MCS employs a Transformer encoder to encode task-specific observations into a shared message space, capturing shared communication skills among agents. To enhance coordination among agents, we introduce a prediction network that correlates messages with the actions of sender agents in each task. We adapt three multi-agent benchmark environments to multi-task settings, where the number of agents as well as the observation and action spaces vary across tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MCS achieves better performance than multi-task MADRL baselines without communication, as well as single-task MADRL baselines with and without communication.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |
| **[The Peril of Preference: Why GRPO fails on Ordinal Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04439v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit, GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior. We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization. This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning. We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback - progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to denser, per-step supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Action Selection for Action Chunking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04421v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action chunking is a widely adopted approach in Learning from Demonstration (LfD). By modeling multi-step action chunks rather than single-step actions, action chunking significantly enhances modeling capabilities for human expert policies. However, the reduced decision frequency restricts the utilization of recent observations, degrading reactivity - particularly evident in the inadequate adaptation to sensor noise and dynamic environmental changes. Existing efforts to address this issue have primarily resorted to trading off reactivity against decision consistency, without achieving both. To address this limitation, we propose a novel algorithm, Temporal Action Selector (TAS), which caches predicted action chunks from multiple timesteps and dynamically selects the optimal action through a lightweight selector network. TAS achieves balanced optimization across three critical dimensions: reactivity, decision consistency, and motion coherence. Experiments across multiple tasks with diverse base policies show that TAS significantly improves success rates - yielding an absolute gain of up to 73.3%. Furthermore, integrating TAS as a base policy with residual reinforcement learning (RL) substantially enhances training efficiency and elevates the performance plateau. Experiments in both simulation and physical robots confirm the method's efficacy.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches struggle to balance rich contextual representation with navigation efficiency. We present MacroNav, a learning-based navigation framework featuring two key components: (1) a lightweight context encoder trained via multi-task self-supervised learning to capture multi-scale, navigation-centric spatial representations; and (2) a reinforcement learning policy that seamlessly integrates these representations with graph-based reasoning for efficient action selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the context encoder's efficient and robust environmental understanding. Real-world deployments further validate MacroNav's effectiveness, yielding significant gains over state-of-the-art navigation methods in both Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), while maintaining low computational cost.

CUAs present unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction. GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available, instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to facilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop CUAs. The full dataset has been made public on https://huggingface.co/datasets/vyokky/GUI-360.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback via Bayesian Preference Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04286v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from human preferences is a cornerstone of aligning machine learning models with subjective human judgments. Yet, collecting such preference data is often costly and time-consuming, motivating the need for more efficient learning paradigms. Two established approaches offer complementary advantages: RLHF scales effectively to high-dimensional tasks such as LLM fine-tuning, while PBO achieves greater sample efficiency through active querying. We propose a hybrid framework that unifies RLHF's scalability with PBO's query efficiency by integrating an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline, thereby enabling active and sample-efficient preference gathering. We validate the proposed approach on two representative domains: (i) high-dimensional preference optimization and (ii) LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall performance across these tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLoop: An Self-Improving Framework for Reinforcement Learning with Iterative Policy Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04285v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSPO: Subsentence-level Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04256v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs' reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data, respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level, which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean, leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Context Bridge the Reality Gap? Sim-to-Real Transfer of Context-Aware Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04249v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) for robotics, as policies trained in simulation often fail to generalize to the real world due to discrepancies in environment dynamics. Domain Randomization (DR) mitigates this issue by exposing the policy to a wide range of randomized dynamics during training, yet leading to a reduction in performance. While standard approaches typically train policies agnostic to these variations, we investigate whether sim-to-real transfer can be improved by conditioning the policy on an estimate of the dynamics parameters -- referred to as context. To this end, we integrate a context estimation module into a DR-based RL framework and systematically compare SOTA supervision strategies. We evaluate the resulting context-aware policies in both a canonical control benchmark and a real-world pushing task using a Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that context-aware policies outperform the context-agnostic baseline across all settings, although the best supervision strategy depends on the task.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches struggle with the energy-latency trade-off, particularly for massive scale deployments exceeding 50,000 devices km. This paper proposes an edge-aware CyberTwin framework integrating hybrid federated learning for energy-latency co-optimization in 6G network slicing. Our approach combines centralized Artificial Intelligence scheduling for latency-sensitive slices with distributed federated learning for non-critical slices, enhanced by compressive sensing-based digital twins and renewable energy-aware resource allocation. The hybrid scheduler leverages a three-tier architecture with Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) based security attestation achieving 99.7% attack detection accuracy. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate 52% energy reduction for non-real-time slices compared to Diffusion-Reinforcement Learning baselines while maintaining 0.9ms latency for URLLC applications with 99.1% SLA compliance. The framework scales to 50,000 devices km with CPU overhead below 25%, validated through NS-3 hybrid simulations across realistic smart city scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shared Spatial Memory Through Predictive Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04235v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization, emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells (SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to 64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social collective intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have prepared the open-source code and video demonstration pages: 1.

However, these models pose extreme safety challenges during real-world deployment, including the risk of harm to the environment, the robot itself, and humans. How can safety constraints be explicitly integrated into VLAs? We address this by exploring an integrated safety approach (ISA), systematically modeling safety requirements, then actively eliciting diverse unsafe behaviors, effectively constraining VLA policies via safe reinforcement learning, and rigorously assuring their safety through targeted evaluations. Leveraging the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) paradigm, ISA optimizes VLAs from a min-max perspective against elicited safety risks. Thus, policies aligned through this comprehensive approach achieve the following key features: (I) effective safety-performance trade-offs, reducing the cumulative cost of safety violations by 83.58% compared to the state-of-the-art method, while also maintaining task success rate (+3.85%). (II) strong safety assurance, with the ability to mitigate long-tail risks and handle extreme failure scenarios. (III) robust generalization of learned safety behaviors to various out-of-distribution perturbations. The effectiveness is evaluated on long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks.

It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty trade-offs.</p></details> |  |

While effective at mitigating harmful responses, these guardrails introduce a new class of vulnerabilities by exposing observable decision patterns. In this work, we present the first study of black-box LLM guardrail reverse-engineering attacks. We propose Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack (GRA), a reinforcement learning-based framework that leverages genetic algorithm-driven data augmentation to approximate the decision-making policy of victim guardrails. By iteratively collecting input-output pairs, prioritizing divergence cases, and applying targeted mutations and crossovers, our method incrementally converges toward a high-fidelity surrogate of the victim guardrail. We evaluate GRA on three widely deployed commercial systems, namely ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen3, and demonstrate that it achieves an rule matching rate exceeding 0.92 while requiring less than $85 in API costs. These findings underscore the practical feasibility of guardrail extraction and highlight significant security risks for current LLM safety mechanisms. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in current guardrail designs and highlight the urgent need for more robust defense mechanisms in LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, current RL methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision. Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward (DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward (DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to learn from continuous experience.</p></details> |  |

However, our empirical analysis reveals a critical drawback: reasoning-oriented RL fine-tuning significantly increases the prevalence of hallucinations. We theoretically analyze the RL training dynamics, identifying high-variance gradient, entropy-induced randomness, and susceptibility to spurious local optima as key factors leading to hallucinations. To address this drawback, we propose Factuality-aware Step-wise Policy Optimization (FSPO), an innovative RL fine-tuning algorithm incorporating explicit factuality verification at each reasoning step. FSPO leverages automated verification against given evidence to dynamically adjust token-level advantage values, incentivizing factual correctness throughout the reasoning process. Experiments across mathematical reasoning and hallucination benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Llama models demonstrate that FSPO effectively reduces hallucinations while enhancing reasoning accuracy, substantially improving both reliability and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement Learning framework and a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism. The Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization framework jointly optimizes travel distance and map uncertainty through a dual-objective reward function, balancing exploration and exploitation. The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces redundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update Stagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental results show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our approach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up to 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments while maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the collaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation on a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical applicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exchange Policy Optimization Algorithm for Semi-Infinite Safe Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04147v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) aims to respect safety requirements while optimizing long-term performance. In many practical applications, however, the problem involves an infinite number of constraints, known as semi-infinite safe RL (SI-safe RL). Such constraints typically appear when safety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space, such as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In this paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic framework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded safety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite constraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint expansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations exceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those with zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This exchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports effective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to optimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a prescribed bound.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), under review</p></details> |

However, existing approaches are either exclusively deployed on simulated humanoid characters, or specialized to specific tasks such as tracking. We propose BFM-Zero, a framework that learns an effective shared latent representation that embeds motions, goals, and rewards into a common space, enabling a single policy to be prompted for multiple downstream tasks without retraining. This well-structured latent space in BFM-Zero enables versatile and robust whole-body skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid in the real world, via diverse inference methods, including zero-shot motion tracking, goal reaching, and reward optimization, and few-shot optimization-based adaptation. Unlike prior on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks, BFM-Zero builds upon recent advancements in unsupervised RL and Forward-Backward (FB) models, which offer an objective-centric, explainable, and smooth latent representation of whole-body motions. We further extend BFM-Zero with critical reward shaping, domain randomization, and history-dependent asymmetric learning to bridge the sim-to-real gap. Those key design choices are quantitatively ablated in simulation. A first-of-its-kind model, BFM-Zero establishes a step toward scalable, promptable behavioral foundation models for whole-body humanoid control.</p></details> |  |

To this end, an adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems. We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our evaluation approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADPO: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18913v5)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is effective but brittle under annotator noise and distribution shift because it operates on hard, pairwise labels and only regularizes log-probability differences. We introduce Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO), a framework that extends preference learning to soft listwise supervision via reference anchoring. ADPO minimizes KL(q || softmax((s - s_ref) / tau_anc)), which (i) recovers supervised fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, maximum-entropy reinforcement learning, and DPO as special cases through suitable choices of target q, anchor policy, and temperature; (ii) induces an implicit trust region governed by the softmax Fisher metric, independent of the anchor; and (iii) supports stable dynamic-anchor updates. Empirically, we observe a task-dependent tradeoff: dynamic anchors improve online exploration under noise, while fixed anchors excel at offline distillation, achieving up to 170 to 5000 times reduction in student-teacher KL on our benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CBMC-V3: A CNS-inspired Control Framework Towards Manipulation Agility with SNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04109v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robotic arm applications extend beyond industrial settings into healthcare, service, and daily life, existing control algorithms struggle to achieve the agile manipulation required for complex environments with dynamic trajectories, unpredictable interactions, and diverse objects. This paper presents a biomimetic control framework based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), inspired by the human Central Nervous System (CNS), to achieve agile control in such environments. The proposed framework features five control modules (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord), three hierarchical control levels (first-order, second-order, third-order), and two information pathways (ascending, descending). Each module is fully implemented using SNN. The spinal cord module uses spike encoding and Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for feedback control. The brainstem module employs a network of LIF and non-spiking LIF neurons to dynamically adjust spinal cord parameters via reinforcement learning. The thalamus module similarly adjusts the cerebellum's torque outputs. The cerebellum module uses a recurrent SNN to learn the robotic arm's dynamics through regression, providing feedforward gravity compensation torques. The framework is validated both in simulation and on real-world robotic arm platform under various loads and trajectories. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms the industrial-grade position control in manipulation agility.</p></details> |  |

A promising direction is to leverage the generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-language models by treating unusual driving scenarios as a logical reasoning task. In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Prior works develop such a framework, but left unanswered a fundamental question of when learned value functions can be concurrently executed. The main contribution of this work is to present theorems which provide necessary and sufficient conditions to concurrently execute sets of learned tasks within subsets of the state space, using a previously proposed min-norm controller. These theorems provide insight into when learned control tasks are possible to be made concurrently executable, when they might already inherently be concurrently executable and when it is not possible at all to make a set of learned tasks concurrently executable using the previously proposed methods. Additional contributions of this work include extending the optimization-based framework to execute multiple tasks encoded by value functions to also account for value functions trained with a discount factor, making the overall framework more compatible with standard RL practices.</p></details> | currently in review |
| **[Composite Flow Matching for Reinforcement Learning with Shifted-Dynamics Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23062v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating pre-collected offline data from a source environment can significantly improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), but this benefit is often challenged by discrepancies between the transition dynamics of the source and target environments. Existing methods typically address this issue by penalizing or filtering out source transitions in high dynamics-gap regions. However, their estimation of the dynamics gap often relies on KL divergence or mutual information, which can be ill-defined when the source and target dynamics have disjoint support. To overcome these limitations, we propose CompFlow, a method grounded in the theoretical connection between flow matching and optimal transport. Specifically, we model the target dynamics as a conditional flow built upon the output distribution of the source-domain flow, rather than learning it directly from a Gaussian prior. This composite structure offers two key advantages: (1) improved generalization for learning target dynamics, and (2) a principled estimation of the dynamics gap via the Wasserstein distance between source and target transitions. Leveraging our principled estimation of the dynamics gap, we further introduce an optimistic active data collection strategy that prioritizes exploration in regions of high dynamics gap, and theoretically prove that it reduces the performance disparity with the optimal policy. Empirically, CompFlow outperforms strong baselines across several RL benchmarks with shifted dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Learning-at-Criticality in Large Language Models for Quantum Field Theory and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03703v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Vision-Driven Reactive Soccer Skills for Humanoid Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03996v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid soccer poses a representative challenge for embodied intelligence, requiring robots to operate within a tightly coupled perception-action loop. However, existing systems typically rely on decoupled modules, resulting in delayed responses and incoherent behaviors in dynamic environments, while real-world perceptual limitations further exacerbate these issues. In this work, we present a unified reinforcement learning-based controller that enables humanoid robots to acquire reactive soccer skills through the direct integration of visual perception and motion control. Our approach extends Adversarial Motion Priors to perceptual settings in real-world dynamic environments, bridging motion imitation and visually grounded dynamic control. We introduce an encoder-decoder architecture combined with a virtual perception system that models real-world visual characteristics, allowing the policy to recover privileged states from imperfect observations and establish active coordination between perception and action. The resulting controller demonstrates strong reactivity, consistently executing coherent and robust soccer behaviors across various scenarios, including real RoboCup matches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://humanoid-kick.github.io</p></details> |
| **[RPRO: Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization for Enhancing Medical QA and Diagnostic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00974v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought (CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however, current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions. First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8 to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection $\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs, compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\% improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity, showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous statistical testing.</p></details> |  |

This survey synthesizes the new frontier of alignment research by addressing critical gaps in multi-modal alignment, cultural fairness, and low-latency optimization. To systematically explore these domains, we first review foundational algo- rithms, including PPO, DPO, and GRPO, before presenting a detailed analysis of the latest innovations. By providing a comparative synthesis of these techniques and outlining open challenges, this work serves as an essential roadmap for researchers building more robust, efficient, and equitable AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Static to Dynamic: Enhancing Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning via Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03828v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning. Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself, leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method, Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives, while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and more stable performance across diverse RL settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Principle of Targeted Intervention for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17697v4)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On the other hand, designing external mechanisms (e.g., intrinsic rewards and human feedback) to coordinate agents mostly relies on empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the above issues. First, we introduce the concept of MARL interaction paradigms (orthogonal to MARL learning paradigms), using MAIDs to analyze and visualize both unguided self-organization and global guidance mechanisms in MARL. Then, we design a new MARL interaction paradigm, referred to as the targeted intervention paradigm that is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance can be mitigated. In implementation, we introduce a causal inference technique, referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI), to realize the targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning paradigm is workable under the design of an MARL interaction paradigm. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Agent Learning via Experience Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03773v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM) agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts, DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shrinking the Variance: Shrinkage Baselines for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03710v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using policy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods typically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each prompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline), reducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator. Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages for each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we propose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt means to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy -- particularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we construct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance policy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a drop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no additional hyper-parameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines consistently outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, leading to lower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process, resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency. The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents serve as transparent design assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article was accepted by 2025 International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD 2025) and was presented in Munich, October 2025</p></details> |
| **[Behavior-Adaptive Q-Learning: A Unifying Framework for Offline-to-Online RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03695v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables training from fixed data without online interaction, but policies learned offline often struggle when deployed in dynamic environments due to distributional shift and unreliable value estimates on unseen state-action pairs. We introduce Behavior-Adaptive Q-Learning (BAQ), a framework designed to enable a smooth and reliable transition from offline to online RL. The key idea is to leverage an implicit behavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency signal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that (i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is high, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online experience is accumulated. This adaptive mechanism reduces error propagation from out-of-distribution estimates, stabilizes early online updates, and accelerates adaptation to new scenarios. Across standard benchmarks, BAQ consistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches, achieving faster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance. Our results demonstrate that implicit behavior adaptation is a principled and practical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment.</p></details> |  |

This study presents an integrated 4D/5D digital-twin framework that couples Building Information Modeling (BIM) with natural-language processing (NLP)-based cost mapping, computer-vision (CV)-driven progress measurement, Bayesian probabilistic CPM updating, and deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) resource-leveling. A nine-month case implementation on a Dallas-Fort Worth mid-rise project demonstrated measurable gains in accuracy and efficiency: 43% reduction in estimating labor, 6% reduction in overtime, and 30% project-buffer utilization, while maintaining an on-time finish at 128 days within P50-P80 confidence bounds. The digital-twin sandbox also enabled real-time "what-if" forecasting and traceable cost-schedule alignment through a 5D knowledge graph. Findings confirm that integrating AI-based analytics with probabilistic CPM and DRL enhances forecasting precision, transparency, and control resilience. The validated workflow establishes a practical pathway toward predictive, adaptive, and auditable construction management.</p></details> |  |

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in training policies for specific autonomous robots, existing frameworks and benchmarks are often constrained to unique platforms, limiting generalization and fair comparisons across different mobility systems. In this paper, we present a multi-domain framework for training, evaluating and deploying RL-based navigation policies across diverse robotic platforms and operational environments. Our work presents four key contributions: (1) a scalable and modular framework, facilitating seamless robot-task interchangeability and reproducible training pipelines; (2) sim-to-real transfer demonstrated through real-world experiments with multiple robots, including a satellite robotic simulator, an unmanned surface vessel, and a wheeled ground vehicle; (3) the release of the first open-source API for deploying Isaac Lab-trained policies to real robots, enabling lightweight inference and rapid field validation; and (4) uniform tasks and metrics for cross-medium evaluation, through a unified evaluation testbed to assess performance of navigation tasks in diverse operational conditions (aquatic, terrestrial and space). By ensuring consistency between simulation and real-world deployment, RoboRAN lowers the barrier to developing adaptable RL-based navigation strategies. Its modular design enables straightforward integration of new robots and tasks through predefined templates, fostering reproducibility and extension to diverse domains. To support the community, we release RoboRAN as open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

For instance, reward-free and goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first remarking that the successor measure itself is not approximately low-rank. Instead, we demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation and estimation errors are primarily governed by a newly introduced quantitity: the spectral recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>63 pa...</summary><p>63 pages, 11 figures.

One fundamental challenge in analyzing a stochastic approximation algorithm is to establish its stability, i.e., to show that the stochastic vector iterates are bounded almost surely. In this paper, we extend the celebrated Borkar-Meyn theorem for stability from the Martingale difference noise setting to the Markovian noise setting, which greatly improves its applicability in reinforcement learning, especially in those off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms with linear function approximation and eligibility traces. Central to our analysis is the diminishing asymptotic rate of change of a few functions, which is implied by both a form of the strong law of large numbers and a form of the law of the iterated logarithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), 2025</p></details> |

The investigation of their convergence properties is not only a major research topic during the early development of the RL field but also receives increasing attention nowadays. This paper formally verifies their almost sure convergence in a unified framework based on the Robbins-Siegmund theorem. The framework developed in this work can be easily extended to convergence rates and other modes of convergence. This work thus makes an important step towards fully formalizing convergent RL results. The code is available at https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/rl-theory-in-lean.</p></details> |  |
| **[Going Beyond Expert Performance via Deep Implicit Imitation Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03616v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning traditionally requires complete state-action demonstrations from optimal or near-optimal experts. These requirements severely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide only state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is often suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation reinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining deep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from observation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation Q-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs expert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence mechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning. This enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training while maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further extend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to tackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a challenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature. HA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging procedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to expert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental results demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns compared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit imitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous action settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging expert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter sensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset sizes and hyperparameter configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor-Efficient High-Dimensional Q-learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03595v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional reinforcement learning faces challenges with complex calculations and low sample efficiency in large state-action spaces. Q-learning algorithms struggle particularly with the curse of dimensionality, where the number of state-action pairs grows exponentially with problem size. While neural network-based approaches like Deep Q-Networks have shown success, recent tensor-based methods using low-rank decomposition offer more parameter-efficient alternatives. Building upon existing tensor-based methods, we propose Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which enhances low-rank tensor decomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action spaces, incorporating novel exploration and regularization mechanisms. The key innovation is an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with visit count-based upper confidence bound to prioritize actions with high uncertainty, avoiding wasteful random exploration. Additionally, we incorporate a frequency-based penalty term in the objective function to encourage exploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to frequently visited regions. Empirical results on classic control tasks demonstrate that TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL approaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications, such as space and healthcare where sampling costs are high.</p></details> |  |
| **[PerfDojo: Automated ML Library Generation for Heterogeneous Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03586v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing complexity of machine learning models and the proliferation of diverse hardware architectures (CPUs, GPUs, accelerators) make achieving optimal performance a significant challenge. Heterogeneity in instruction sets, specialized kernel requirements for different data types and model features (e.g., sparsity, quantization), and architecture-specific optimizations complicate performance tuning. Manual optimization is resource-intensive, while existing automatic approaches often rely on complex hardware-specific heuristics and uninterpretable intermediate representations, hindering performance portability. We introduce PerfLLM, a novel automatic optimization methodology leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Central to this is PerfDojo, an environment framing optimization as an RL game using a human-readable, mathematically-inspired code representation that guarantees semantic validity through transformations. This allows effective optimization without prior hardware knowledge, facilitating both human analysis and RL agent training. We demonstrate PerfLLM's ability to achieve significant performance gains across diverse CPU (x86, Arm, RISC-V) and GPU architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[SMART-WRITE: Adaptive Learning-based Write Energy Optimization for Phase Change Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04713v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and other current transistor-based memories approach their scalability limits, the search for alternative storage methods becomes increasingly urgent. Phase-change memory (PCM) emerges as a promising candidate due to its scalability, fast access time, and zero leakage power compared to many existing memory technologies. However, PCM has significant drawbacks that currently hinder its viability as a replacement. PCM cells suffer from a limited lifespan because write operations degrade the physical material, and these operations consume a considerable amount of energy. For PCM to be a practical option for data storage-which involves frequent write operations-its cell endurance must be enhanced, and write energy must be reduced. In this paper, we propose SMART-WRITE, a method that integrates neural networks (NN) and reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically optimize write energy and improve performance. The NN model monitors real-time operating conditions and device characteristics to determine optimal write parameters, while the RL model dynamically adjusts these parameters to further optimize PCM's energy consumption. By continuously adjusting PCM write parameters based on real-time system conditions, SMART-WRITE reduces write energy consumption by up to 63% and improves performance by up to 51% compared to the baseline and previous models.</p></details> |  |
| **[NCSAC: Effective Neural Community Search via Attribute-augmented Conductance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04712v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying locally dense communities closely connected to the user-initiated query node is crucial for a wide range of applications. Existing approaches either solely depend on rule-based constraints or exclusively utilize deep learning technologies to identify target communities. Therefore, an important question is proposed: can deep learning be integrated with rule-based constraints to elevate the quality of community search? In this paper, we affirmatively address this question by introducing a novel approach called Neural Community Search via Attribute-augmented Conductance, abbreviated as NCSAC. Specifically, NCSAC first proposes a novel concept of attribute-augmented conductance, which harmoniously blends the (internal and external) structural proximity and the attribute similarity. Then, NCSAC extracts a coarse candidate community of satisfactory quality using the proposed attribute-augmented conductance. Subsequently, NCSAC frames the community search as a graph optimization task, refining the candidate community through sophisticated reinforcement learning techniques, thereby producing high-quality results. Extensive experiments on six real-world graphs and ten competitors demonstrate the superiority of our solutions in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. Notably, the proposed solution outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an impressive F1-score improvement ranging from 5.3\% to 42.4\%.

| **[Reinforcement Learning Foundations for Deep Research Systems: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06733v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator, and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback. Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent, off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence on such human priors and rater biases. This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations of deep research systems. It systematizes recent work along three axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA, VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, second version</p></details> |
| **[Learning Without Critics? Revisiting GRPO in Classical Reinforcement Learning Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03527v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by eliminating the learned critic and instead estimating advantages through group-relative comparisons of trajectories. This simplification raises fundamental questions about the necessity of learned baselines in policy-gradient methods. We present the first systematic study of GRPO in classical single-task reinforcement learning environments, spanning discrete and continuous control tasks. Through controlled ablations isolating baselines, discounting, and group sampling, we reveal three key findings: (1) learned critics remain essential for long-horizon tasks: all critic-free baselines underperform PPO except in short-horizon environments like CartPole where episodic returns can be effective; (2) GRPO benefits from high discount factors (gamma = 0.99) except in HalfCheetah, where lack of early termination favors moderate discounting (gamma = 0.9); (3) smaller group sizes outperform larger ones, suggesting limitations in batch-based grouping strategies that mix unrelated episodes. These results reveal both the limitations of critic-free methods in classical control and the specific conditions where they remain viable alternatives to learned value functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViFP: A Framework for Visual False Positive Detection to Enhance Reasoning Reliability in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04201v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), false positive (FP) reasoning occurs when a model produces the correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning path, resulting in undermined reasoning reliability. Existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering, knowledge distillation or reinforcement learning to improve reasoning reliability, both of which require large amounts of high-quality data and thus limit practical applicability. Few approaches have focused on directly detecting and correcting FPs. To address these issues, we propose ViFP, a framework for Visual False Positive Detection to Enhance Reasoning Reliability in VLMs. ViFP builds effective reasoning paths through multi-turn QA and dynamically analyzes the consistency of the reasoning path to identify potential FPs. It also introduces a targeted reasoning chain correction mechanism to modify FP reasoning, thereby improving logical consistency and accuracy. Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric, VoC, which integrates answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess whether a VLM not only answers correctly but also reasons reliably. Our experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OK-VQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in enhancing reasoning reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Using known Invariances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03473v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems, the environment exhibits inherent symmetries that can be exploited to improve learning efficiency. This paper develops a theoretical and algorithmic framework for incorporating known group symmetries into kernel-based RL. We propose a symmetry-aware variant of optimistic least-squares value iteration (LSVI), which leverages invariant kernels to encode invariance in both rewards and transition dynamics. Our analysis establishes new bounds on the maximum information gain and covering numbers for invariant RKHSs, explicitly quantifying the sample efficiency gains from symmetry. Empirical results on a customized Frozen Lake environment and a 2D placement design problem confirm the theoretical improvements, demonstrating that symmetry-aware RL achieves significantly better performance than their standard kernel counterparts. These findings highlight the value of structural priors in designing more sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) struggle with this task, frequently failing to interpret user intent (misinterpretation) or unnecessarily altering the original question's structure (over-correction). We propose QuestionRAG, a framework that tackles these problems. To address misinterpretation, it enriches the input with external knowledge (e.g., search results, related entities). To prevent over-correction, it uses reinforcement learning (RL) to align the model's objective with precise correction, not just paraphrasing. Our results demonstrate that knowledge augmentation is critical for understanding faulty questions. Furthermore, RL-based alignment proves significantly more effective than traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), boosting the model's ability to follow instructions and generalize. By integrating these two strategies, QuestionRAG unlocks the full potential of LLMs for the question correction task.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

This combination makes them also suitable for classical search problems. However, the original method of training the network with simulation results is limited in sparse reward settings, especially in the early stages, where the network cannot yet give guidance. Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) addresses this issue by relabeling unsuccessful trajectories from the search tree as supervised learning signals. We introduce Adaptable HER (\ours{}), a flexible framework that integrates HER with AlphaZero, allowing easy adjustments to HER properties such as relabeled goals, policy targets, and trajectory selection. Our experiments, including equation discovery, show that the possibility of modifying HER is beneficial and surpasses the performance of pure supervised or reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, Presented at the 9th International Workshop on Interactive Adaptive Learning</p></details> |

Centralized architectures fall short in addressing these demands, often resulting in elevated energy consumption, latency, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes MetaFed, a decentralized federated learning (FL) framework that enables sustainable and intelligent resource orchestration for Metaverse environments. MetaFed integrates (i) multi-agent reinforcement learning for dynamic client selection, (ii) privacy-preserving FL using homomorphic encryption, and (iii) carbon-aware scheduling aligned with renewable energy availability. Evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using lightweight ResNet architectures demonstrate that MetaFed achieves up to 25% reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional approaches, while maintaining high accuracy and minimal communication overhead. These results highlight MetaFed as a scalable solution for building environmentally responsible and privacy-compliant Metaverse infrastructures.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Symposium on Emerging Metaverse (ISEMV), co-located with the 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)</p></details> |

We introduce EverydayVLA, a 6-DOF manipulator that can be assembled for under $300, capable of modest payloads and workspace. A single unified model jointly outputs discrete and continuous actions, and our adaptive-horizon ensemble monitors motion uncertainty to trigger on-the-fly re-planning for safe, reliable operation. On LIBERO, EverydayVLA matches state-of-the-art success rates, and in real-world tests it outperforms prior methods by 49% in-distribution and 34.9% out-of-distribution. By combining a state-of-the-art VLA with cost-effective hardware, EverydayVLA democratizes access to a robotic foundation model and paves the way for economical use in homes and research labs alike.

The system integrates a torque-controlled robotic manipulator with interchangeable passive props (silicone hand replicas and a baton), marker-based physical-virtual registration via a ChArUco board, and a safety monitor that gates motion based on the user's head and hand pose. We introduce two control strategies: (i) a static mode that presents a stationary prop aligned with its virtual counterpart, consistent with prior ETHD baselines, and (ii) a dynamic mode that continuously updates prop position by exponentially blending an initial mid-point trajectory with real-time hand tracking, generating a unique contact point for each interaction. Bench tests show static colocation accuracy of 5.09 +/- 0.94 mm, while user interactions achieved temporal alignment with an average contact latency of 28.53 +/- 31.21 ms across all interaction and control conditions. These results demonstrate the feasibility of recreating socially meaningful haptics in VR. By incorporating essential safety and control mechanisms, ETHOS establishes a practical foundation for high-fidelity, dynamic interpersonal interactions in virtual environments.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Force-Safe Environment Maps and Real-Time Detection for Soft Robot Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05307v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robot manipulators have the potential for deployment in delicate environments to perform complex manipulation tasks. However, existing obstacle detection and avoidance methods do not consider limits on the forces that manipulators may exert upon contact with delicate obstacles. This work introduces a framework that maps force safety criteria from task space (i.e. positions along the robot's body) to configuration space (i.e. the robot's joint angles) and enables real-time force safety detection. We incorporate limits on allowable environmental contact forces for given task-space obstacles, and map them into configuration space (C-space) through the manipulator's forward kinematics. This formulation ensures that configurations classified as safe are provably below the maximum force thresholds, thereby allowing us to determine force-safe configurations of the soft robot manipulator in real-time. We validate our approach in simulation and hardware experiments on a two-segment pneumatic soft robot manipulator. Results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately detects force safety during interactions with deformable obstacles, thereby laying the foundation for real-time safe planning of soft manipulators in delicate, cluttered environments.</p></details> |  |

Advanced robotic systems often rely on extensive datasets to learn manipulation tasks. In contrast, when humans are faced with unfamiliar tasks, such as assembling a chair, a common approach is to learn by watching video demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning robot policies by Retrieving-from-Video (RfV), using analogies from human demonstrations to address manipulation tasks. Our system constructs a video bank comprising recordings of humans performing diverse daily tasks. To enrich the knowledge from these videos, we extract mid-level information, such as object affordance masks and hand motion trajectories, which serve as additional inputs to enhance the robot model's learning and generalization capabilities. We further feature a dual-component system: a video retriever that taps into an external video bank to fetch task-relevant video based on task specification, and a policy generator that integrates this retrieved knowledge into the learning cycle. This approach enables robots to craft adaptive responses to various scenarios and generalize to tasks beyond those in the training data. Through rigorous testing in multiple simulated and real-world settings, our system demonstrates a marked improvement in performance over conventional robotic systems, showcasing a significant breakthrough in the field of robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

Creating similar swarm intelligence in engineered robots poses challenges to the design of collaborative algorithms that can be programmed at large scales. The assignment-based method has played an eminent role for a very long time in solving collaboration problems of robot swarms. However, it faces fundamental limitations in terms of efficiency and robustness due to its unscalability to swarm variants. This article presents a tutorial review on recent advances in assignment-free collaboration of robot swarms, focusing on the problem of shape formation. A key theoretical component is the recently developed \emph{mean-shift exploration} strategy, which improves the collaboration efficiency of large-scale swarms by dozens of times. Further, the efficiency improvement is more significant as the swarm scale increases. Finally, this article discusses three important applications of the mean-shift exploration strategy, including precise shape formation, area coverage formation, and maneuvering formation, as well as their corresponding industrial scenarios in smart warehousing, area exploration, and cargo transportation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Affordance-based Robot Manipulation with Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01083v5)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a framework for assistive robot manipulation, which focuses on two fundamental challenges: first, efficiently adapting large-scale models to downstream scene affordance understanding tasks, especially in daily living scenarios where gathering multi-task data involving humans requires strenuous effort; second, effectively learning robot action trajectories by grounding the visual affordance model. We tackle the first challenge by employing a parameter-efficient prompt tuning method that prepends learnable text prompts to the frozen vision model to predict manipulation affordances in multi-task scenarios. Then we propose to learn robot action trajectories guided by affordances in a supervised flow matching method. Flow matching represents a robot visuomotor policy as a conditional process of flowing random waypoints to desired robot action trajectories. Finally, we introduce a real-world dataset with 10 tasks across Activities of Daily Living to test our framework. Our extensive evaluation highlights that the proposed prompt tuning method for learning manipulation affordance achieves competitive performance and even outperforms some other finetuning protocols across data scales, while satisfying parameter efficiency. Learning multi-task robot action trajectories with flow matching leads to consistently favorable results in several robot manipulation benchmarks than some alternative behavior cloning methods. This includes more stable training and evaluation, and noticeably faster inference, while maintaining comparable generalization performance to diffusion policy, where flow matching performs marginally better in most cases. Our framework seamlessly unifies affordance learning and action generation with flow matching for robot manipulation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose the Mixture of Experts-Enhanced Diffusion Policy (MoE-DP), where the core idea is to insert a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer between the visual encoder and the diffusion model. This layer decomposes the policy's knowledge into a set of specialized experts, which are dynamically activated to handle different phases of a task. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MoE-DP exhibits a strong capability to recover from disturbances, significantly outperforming standard baselines in robustness. On a suite of 6 long-horizon simulation tasks, this leads to a 36% average relative improvement in success rate under disturbed conditions. This enhanced robustness is further validated in the real world, where MoE-DP also shows significant performance gains. We further show that MoE-DP learns an interpretable skill decomposition, where distinct experts correspond to semantic task primitives (e.g., approaching, grasping). This learned structure can be leveraged for inference-time control, allowing for the rearrangement of subtasks without any re-training.Our video and code are available at the https://moe-dp-website.github.io/MoE-DP-Website/.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based approach that enables systematic generalization from single-context demonstrations to a wide range of unseen start and goal configurations. Our method performs component-level reparameterization of the GMM, adapting both mean vectors and covariance matrices, followed by Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) to generate smooth trajectories. We evaluate the approach on a dual-arm pick-and-place task with varying box placements, comparing against several baselines. Results show that our method significantly outperforms baselines in trajectory success and fidelity, maintaining accuracy even under combined translational and rotational variations of task configurations. These results demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively while ensuring boundary convergence and preserving the intrinsic structure of demonstrated motions.</p></details> |  |
