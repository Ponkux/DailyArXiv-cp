| **[TPT-Bench: A Large-Scale, Long-Term and Robot-Egocentric Dataset for Benchmarking Target Person Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07446v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking a target person from robot-egocentric views is crucial for developing autonomous robots that provide continuous personalized assistance or collaboration in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Embodied AI. However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoramic images, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 48 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing SOTA TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |
| **[A Neural Representation Framework with LLM-Driven Spatial Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06719v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical feature field. This field represents language and instance features using distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations, outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their spatial reasoning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamArt: Generating Interactable Articulated Objects from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05763v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR. Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated asset generation.

| **[PAPRLE (Plug-And-Play Robotic Limb Environment): A Modular Ecosystem for Robotic Limbs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05555v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce PAPRLE (Plug-And-Play Robotic Limb Environment), a modular ecosystem that enables flexible placement and control of robotic limbs. With PAPRLE, a user can change the arrangement of the robotic limbs, and control them using a variety of input devices, including puppeteers, gaming controllers, and VR-based interfaces. This versatility supports a wide range of teleoperation scenarios and promotes adaptability to different task requirements. To further enhance configurability, we introduce a pluggable puppeteer device that can be easily mounted and adapted to match the target robot configurations. PAPRLE supports bilateral teleoperation through these puppeteer devices, agnostic to the type or configuration of the follower robot. By supporting both joint-space and task-space control, the system provides real-time force feedback, improving user fidelity and physical interaction awareness. The modular design of PAPRLE facilitates novel spatial arrangements of the limbs and enables scalable data collection, thereby advancing research in embodied AI and learning-based control. We validate PAPRLE in various real-world settings, demonstrating its versatility across diverse combinations of leader devices and follower robots. The system will be released as open source, including both hardware and software components, to support broader adoption and community-driven extension. Additional resources and demonstrations are available at the project website: https://uiuckimlab.github.io/paprle-pages</p></details> |  |
| **[ViGiL3D: A Linguistically Diverse Dataset for 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01366v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D visual grounding (3DVG) involves localizing entities in a 3D scene referred to by natural language text. Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages with 8 figures and 14 tables; updated for ACL 2025 camera-ready with additional discussion and figures</p></details> |
| **[EmbodieDreamer: Advancing Real2Sim2Real Transfer for Policy Training via Embodied World Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05198v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner, a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap. It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74% compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by 89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://embodiedreamer.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Embodied AI Agents: Modeling the World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22355v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices, and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings, which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents, allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free Generation of Temporally Consistent Rewards from VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04789v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks, demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://t2-vlm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimLauncher: Launching Sample-Efficient Real-world Robotic Reinforcement Learning via Simulation Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04452v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection, while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment, which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboBrain 2.0 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02029v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce RoboBrain 2.0, our latest generation of embodied vision-language foundation models, designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents. The code, checkpoint and benchmark are available at https://superrobobrain.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic 3D Scene Generation with Spatially Contextualized VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20129v3)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

| **[Benchmarking Generalizable Bimanual Manipulation: RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at CVPR 2025 MEIS Workshop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23351v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is an emerging frontier in robotics, driven by the need for autonomous systems that can perceive, reason, and act in complex physical environments. While single-arm systems have shown strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025. Built on the RoboTwin Simulation platform (1.0 and 2.0) and the AgileX COBOT-Magic Robot platform, the competition consisted of three stages: Simulation Round 1, Simulation Round 2, and a final Real-World Round. Participants totally tackled 17 dual-arm manipulation tasks, covering rigid, deformable, and tactile-based scenarios. The challenge attracted 64 global teams and over 400 participants, producing top-performing solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3 and generating valuable insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning. This report outlines the competition setup, task design, evaluation methodology, key findings and future direction, aiming to support future research on robust and generalizable bimanual manipulation policies.

| **[TC-Light: Temporally Coherent Generative Rendering for Realistic World Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18904v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Illumination and texture editing are critical dimensions for world-to-world transfer, which is valuable for applications including sim2real and real2real visual data scaling up for embodied AI. Existing techniques generatively re-render the input video to realize the transfer, such as video relighting models and conditioned world generation models. Nevertheless, these models are predominantly limited to the domain of training data (e.g., portrait) or fall into the bottleneck of temporal consistency and computation efficiency, especially when the input video involves complex dynamics and long durations. In this paper, we propose TC-Light, a novel generative renderer to overcome these problems. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark. Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible re-rendering results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking, space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings, leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend. We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.</p></details> |  |
| **[Articulate3D: Holistic Understanding of 3D Scenes as Universal Scene Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01398v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene understanding is a long-standing challenge in computer vision and a key component in enabling mixed reality, wearable computing, and embodied AI. Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets and algorithms approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered in the research field. In this work, we address this shortcoming by introducing: (1) Articulate3D, an expertly curated 3D dataset featuring high-quality manual annotations on 280 indoor scenes. Articulate3D provides 8 types of annotations for articulated objects, covering parts and detailed motion information, all stored in a standardized scene representation format designed for scalable 3D content creation, exchange and seamless integration into simulation environments. (2) USDNet, a novel unified framework capable of simultaneously predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes for articulated objects. We evaluate USDNet on Articulate3D as well as two existing datasets, demonstrating the advantage of our unified dense prediction approach. Furthermore, we highlight the value of Articulate3D through cross-dataset and cross-domain evaluations and showcase its applicability in downstream tasks such as scene editing through LLM prompting and robotic policy training for articulated object manipulation. We provide open access to our dataset, benchmark, and method's source code.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey: Learning Embodied Intelligence from Physical Simulators and World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00917v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) has placed embodied intelligence at the forefront of robotics research. Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems. We also maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature and open-source projects at https://github.com/NJU3DV-LoongGroup/Embodied-World-Models-Survey.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/NJU3DV-LoongGroup/Embodied-World-Models-Survey</p></details> |

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Project Page: https://cl-splats.github.io</p></details> |

Current language model-based navigation systems operate on discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient, reward-driven post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: vlnr1.github.io</p></details> |
| **[From 2D to 3D Cognition: A Brief Survey of General World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20134v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models have garnered increasing attention in the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), serving as computational frameworks for learning representations of the external world and forecasting future states. While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent 3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward 3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing 3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in 3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning, and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing more robust and generalizable 3D world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Multi-sensor Fusion Perception for Embodied AI: Background, Methods, Challenges and Prospects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19769v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI, which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion, while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods. A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

The recent rise of AI scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning, and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration, and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven science.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting 19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks. We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs in practical applications such as robotics and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional cloud-based telerobotics suffers from latency, reliability, scalability, and resilience issues, hindering real-time performance in critical applications. Cloud-Fog Telerobotics (CFTel) builds on the Cloud-Fog Automation (CFA) paradigm to address these limitations by leveraging a distributed Cloud-Edge-Robotics computing architecture, enabling deterministic connectivity, deterministic connected intelligence, and deterministic networked computing. This paper synthesizes recent advancements in CFTel, aiming to highlight its role in facilitating scalable, low-latency, autonomous, and AI-driven telerobotics. We analyze architectural frameworks and technologies that enable them, including 5G Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication, Edge Intelligence, Embodied AI, and Digital Twins. The study demonstrates that CFTel has the potential to enhance real-time control, scalability, and autonomy while supporting service-oriented solutions. We also discuss practical challenges, including latency constraints, cybersecurity risks, interoperability issues, and standardization efforts. This work serves as a foundational reference for researchers, stakeholders, and industry practitioners in future telerobotics research.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, accepted paper on the 23rd IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN), July 12-15, 2025, Kunming, China</p></details> |
| **[Adapting Vision-Language Models for Evaluating World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17967v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable, semantics-aware evaluator for world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Embodied AI: Advances and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05108v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in simulation platforms have greatly enhanced task diversity to train embodied Vision Language Models (VLMs), most platforms rely on simplified robot morphologies and bypass the stochastic nature of low-level execution, which limits their transferability to real-world robots. To address these issues, we present a physics-based simulation platform DualTHOR for complex dual-arm humanoid robots, built upon an extended version of AI2-THOR. Our simulator includes real-world robot assets, a task suite for dual-arm collaboration, and inverse kinematics solvers for humanoid robots. We also introduce a contingency mechanism that incorporates potential failures through physics-based low-level execution, bridging the gap to real-world scenarios. Our simulator enables a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness and generalization of VLMs in household environments. Extensive evaluations reveal that current VLMs struggle with dual-arm coordination and exhibit limited robustness in realistic environments with contingencies, highlighting the importance of using our simulator to develop more capable VLMs for embodied tasks.

| **[BoxFusion: Reconstruction-Free Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection via Real-Time Multi-View Box Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15610v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Efficient and Generalizable Environmental Understanding for Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15377v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality, introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly-supervised VLM-guided Partial Contrastive Learning for Visual Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15757v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental task within the field of Embodied AI, focusing on the ability of agents to navigate complex environments based on natural language instructions. Despite the progress made by existing methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results, their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning (WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their capabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and deformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the lack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under diverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for generating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac features a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional tactile sensors \sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip detection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips. Furthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis pipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based on this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm robotic system. Experiments demonstrate that PP-Tac can effectively grasp paper-like objects of varying material, thickness, and stiffness, achieving an overall success rate of 87.5\%. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to grasp paper-like deformable objects using a tactile dexterous hand.

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

The diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI. However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation. EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging generative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the needs of embodied intelligence related research.

| **[Object-Centric Latent Action Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09680v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled internet video data for embodied AI is currently bottlenecked by the lack of action labels and the presence of action-correlated visual distractors. Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy-action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle action-related and distracting dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Workshop on World Models at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025, Poster, Project Page: https://laom.dunnolab.ai/, Source code: https://github.com/dunnolab/laom</p></details> |

Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[OctoNav: Towards Generalist Embodied Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09839v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents, which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1. Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1, we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e., Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically, we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability. Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Analytic Task Scheduler: Recursive Least Squares Based Method for Continual Learning in Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09623v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied foundation models are crucial for Artificial Intelligence (AI) interacting with the physical world by integrating multi-modal inputs, such as proprioception, vision and language, to understand human intentions and generate actions to control robots. While these models demonstrate strong generalization and few-shot learning capabilities, they face significant challenges in continually acquiring new skills without forgetting previously learned skills, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for continual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a task-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a single task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares (RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific models. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model selection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The scheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics (autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant learning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a real-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to forgetting and strong adaptability to task variations. The results highlight ATS as an effective, scalable, and deployable solution for continual learning in embodied foundation models operating in complex, dynamic environments. Our code will be available at https://github.com/MIAA-Embodied-AI/AnalyticTaskScheduler</p></details> |  |
| **[What Can RL Bring to VLA Generalization? An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://faceong.github.io/VIKI-R/</p></details> |

Understanding their kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$ larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories.

We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://metadriverse.github.io/dreamland/</p></details> |

Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

| **[LLM-driven Indoor Scene Layout Generation via Scaled Human-aligned Data Synthesis and Multi-Stage Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07570v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches such as Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes. Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such as drones and mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025 Embodied AI Workshop</p></details> |

Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate, and this trend is strongly evident in manipulation tasks. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots for manipulation tasks are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes \textsc{Corki}\xspace, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI-powered robotic manipulation applications. We aim to decouple LLM inference, robotic control, and data communication in the embodied AI robots' compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, \textsc{Corki}\xspace predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. \textsc{Corki}\xspace largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to $5.1\times$, resulting in up to $5.9\times$ speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 13.9\%.</p></details> |  |

Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence (maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21 held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed. Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors for scalable open-world visual understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05341v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://directlayout.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[OGGSplat: Open Gaussian Growing for Generalizable Reconstruction with Expanded Field-of-View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05204v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards provable probabilistic safety for scalable embodied AI systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05171v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. To address this challenge, we introduce provable probabilistic safety, which aims to ensure that the residual risk of large-scale deployment remains below a predefined threshold. Instead of attempting exhaustive safety proof across all corner cases, this paradigm establishes a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance, leveraging statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability. A well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale while allowing for continuous refinement of safety guarantees. Our work focuses on three core questions: what is provable probabilistic safety, how to prove the probabilistic safety, and how to achieve the provable probabilistic safety. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, our work offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  |

Both components employ modular 3D-printed finger designs, achieving ultra-low manufacturing costs while maintaining full actuation capabilities. Departing from conventional tendon-driven or underactuated approaches, our electromechanical system integrates independent joint motors across all 23 DoF, ensuring complete state observability and accurate kinematic modeling. This full-actuation architecture enables precise bidirectional kinematic calculations, substantially enhancing kinematic retargeting fidelity between the exoskeleton and robotic hand. The proposed system bridges the cost-performance gap in dexterous manipulation research, providing an accessible platform for acquiring high-quality demonstration data to advance embodied AI and dexterous robotic skill transfer learning.</p></details> |  |

We begin with a practical challenge: training a cross-morphology embodied AI policy that generalizes across diverse robot morphologies. We formalize this as the Heterogeneous Embodied Agent Training (HEAT) problem and prove it reduces to a structured Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that is PSPACE-complete. This result explains why current reinforcement learning pipelines break down under morphological diversity, due to sequential training constraints, memory-policy coupling, and data incompatibility. We further explore Collective Adaptation, a distributed learning alternative inspired by biological systems. Though NEXP-complete in theory, it offers meaningful scalability and deployment benefits in practice. This work illustrates how computational theory can illuminate system design trade-offs and guide the development of more robust, scalable embodied AI. For practitioners and researchers to explore this problem, the implementation code of this work has been made publicly available at https://github.com/airs-admin/HEAT</p></details> |  |

Traditional learning-based methods rely heavily on large-scale annotated data or require extensive interaction with the environment in a reinforcement learning setting, often failing to generalize to novel environments and limiting scalability. To overcome these challenges, we explore a zero-shot setting where the agent operates without task-specific training, enabling more scalable and adaptable solution. Recent advances in Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) offer powerful capabilities for visual understanding and reasoning, making them ideal for agents to comprehend scenes, identify relevant regions, and infer the likely locations of objects. In this work, we present a zero-shot object goal navigation framework that integrates the perceptual strength of VFMs with a model-based planner that is capable of long-horizon decision making through frontier exploration. We evaluate our approach on the HM3D dataset using the Habitat simulator and demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of success weighted by path length for zero-shot object goal navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 workshop - Foundation Models Meet Embodied Agents</p></details> |

Specifically, Map and Locate involves generating a point cloud from an unposed video and segmenting object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task serves as a critical step toward real-world embodied AI applications and introduces a practical task that bridges reconstruction, recognition and reorganization. To tackle this task, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline, which we denote as SAB3R. Our approach builds upon MASt3R, a recent breakthrough in 3D computer vision, and incorporates a lightweight distillation strategy. This method transfers dense, per-pixel semantic features from 2D vision backbones (eg, CLIP and DINOv2) to enhance MASt3R's capabilities. Without introducing any auxiliary frozen networks, our model generates per-pixel semantic features and constructs cohesive point maps in a single forward pass. Compared to separately deploying MASt3R and CLIP, our unified model, SAB3R, achieves superior performance on the Map and Locate benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate SAB3R on both 2D semantic segmentation and 3D tasks to comprehensively validate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>3D-LL...</summary><p>3D-LLM/VLA @ CVPR2025 | Project page: https://uva-computer-vision-lab.github.io/sab3r/</p></details> |

We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric video contexts. EgoVLM is fine-tuned via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method adapted to align model outputs with human-like reasoning steps. Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought (CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by 14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability, making it well-suited for downstream applications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel keyframe-based reward that incorporates salient frame selection to guide reinforcement learning optimization.

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |

However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains.

Recent learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure. To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time. Rig raymaps allow the model to infer rig structure directly from input images when metadata is missing. Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.</p></details> |  |

While existing audio spatialization methods can generally map any available monaural audio to binaural audio signals, they often lack the flexible and interactive control needed in complex multi-object user-interactive environments. To address this, we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes flexible text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and comprehension perspectives. Due to the limited availability of premium and large-scale stereo data, we construct the SpatialTAS dataset, which encompasses 376,000 simulated binaural audio samples to facilitate the training of our model. Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and relative position prompts, augmented by flipped-channel audio. It outperforms existing methods on both simulated and real-recorded datasets, demonstrating superior generalization and accuracy. Besides, we develop an assessment model based on Llama-3.1-8B, which evaluates the spatial semantic coherence between our generated binaural audio and text prompts through a spatial reasoning task. Results demonstrate that text prompts provide flexible and interactive control to generate binaural audio with excellent quality and semantic consistency in spatial locations.

Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, i.e., pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the representation strategy. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multifaceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multimodal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions.

We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy. For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

We introduce Disjoint-3DQA , a generative QA benchmark that evaluates this ability of VLMs by posing questions about object pairs that are not co-visible in the same frame. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art VLMs and found that models lag behind human performance by 28%, with steeper declines in accuracy (60% to 30 %) as the temporal gap widens. Our analysis further reveals that providing trajectories or bird's-eye-view projections to VLMs results in only marginal improvements, whereas providing oracle 3D coordinates leads to a substantial 20% performance increase. This highlights a core bottleneck of multi-frame VLMs in constructing and maintaining 3D scene representations over time from visual signals. Disjoint-3DQA therefore sets a clear, measurable challenge for long-horizon spatial reasoning and aims to catalyze future research at the intersection of vision, language, and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[ManiSkill3: GPU Parallelized Robotics Simulation and Rendering for Generalizable Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00425v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation has enabled unprecedented compute-scalable approaches to robot learning. However, many existing simulation frameworks typically support a narrow range of scenes/tasks and lack features critical for scaling generalizable robotics and sim2real. We introduce and open source ManiSkill3, the fastest state-visual GPU parallelized robotics simulator with contact-rich physics targeting generalizable manipulation. ManiSkill3 supports GPU parallelization of many aspects including simulation+rendering, heterogeneous simulation, pointclouds/voxels visual input, and more. Simulation with rendering on ManiSkill3 can run 10-1000x faster with 2-3x less GPU memory usage than other platforms, achieving up to 30,000+ FPS in benchmarked environments due to minimal python/pytorch overhead in the system, simulation on the GPU, and the use of the SAPIEN parallel rendering system. Tasks that used to take hours to train can now take minutes. We further provide the most comprehensive range of GPU parallelized environments/tasks spanning 12 distinct domains including but not limited to mobile manipulation for tasks such as drawing, humanoids, and dextrous manipulation in realistic scenes designed by artists or real-world digital twins. In addition, millions of demonstration frames are provided from motion planning, RL, and teleoperation. ManiSkill3 also provides a comprehensive set of baselines that span popular RL and learning-from-demonstrations algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://maniskill.ai/</p></details> |

Modeling hand-object interaction priors holds significant potential to advance robotic and embodied AI systems in learning to operate effectively within the physical world. We introduce SIGHT, a novel task focused on generating realistic and physically plausible 3D hand-object interaction trajectories from a single image and a brief language-based task description. Prior work on hand-object trajectory generation typically relies on textual input that lacks explicit grounding to the target object, or assumes access to 3D object meshes, which are often considerably more difficult to obtain than 2D images. We propose SIGHT-Fusion, a novel diffusion-based image-text conditioned generative model that tackles this task by retrieving the most similar 3D object mesh from a database and enforcing geometric hand-object interaction constraints via a novel inference-time diffusion guidance. We benchmark our model on the HOI4D and H2O datasets, adapting relevant baselines for this novel task. Experiments demonstrate our superior performance in the diversity and quality of generated trajectories, as well as in hand-object interaction geometry metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrackVLA: Embodied Visual Tracking in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23189v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied visual tracking is a fundamental skill in Embodied AI, enabling an agent to follow a specific target in dynamic environments using only egocentric vision. This task is inherently challenging as it requires both accurate target recognition and effective trajectory planning under conditions of severe occlusion and high scene dynamics. Existing approaches typically address this challenge through a modular separation of recognition and planning. In this work, we propose TrackVLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that learns the synergy between object recognition and trajectory planning. Leveraging a shared LLM backbone, we employ a language modeling head for recognition and an anchor-based diffusion model for trajectory planning. To train TrackVLA, we construct an Embodied Visual Tracking Benchmark (EVT-Bench) and collect diverse difficulty levels of recognition samples, resulting in a dataset of 1.7 million samples. Through extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world environments, TrackVLA demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalizability. It significantly outperforms existing methods on public benchmarks in a zero-shot manner while remaining robust to high dynamics and occlusion in real-world scenarios at 10 FPS inference speed.

| **[LLM Meets Scene Graph: Can Large Language Models Understand and Generate Scene Graphs? A Benchmark and Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19510v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for their expanding applications in embodied AI, robotics, and other real-world tasks. To effectively support these applications, grounding in spatial and temporal understanding in multimodal environments is essential. To this end, recent works have leveraged scene graphs, a structured representation that encodes entities, attributes, and their relationships in a scene. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs' ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that these models fail to effectively decompose discrete scenes from a complex narrative, leading to a bottleneck when generating scene graphs. These findings underscore the need for improved methodologies in scene graph generation and provide valuable insights for future research. The demonstration of our benchmark is available at https://tsg-bench.netlify.app. Additionally, our code and evaluation data are publicly available at https://github.com/docworlds/tsg-bench.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling. We release all resources to foster research in robust visuospatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author list corrected.

| **[Functionality understanding and segmentation in 3D scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16310v5)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

| **[Reinforced Reasoning for Embodied Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22050v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |

By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interactions, robots can improve understanding, adapt to, and execute complex tasks in dynamic real-world environments. However, embodied AI in mobile service robots continues to face key challenges, including multimodal sensor fusion, real-time decision-making under uncertainty, task generalization, and effective human-robot interactions (HRI). In this paper, we present the first systematic review of the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics, identifying key open challenges in embodied AI and examining how foundation models can address them. Namely, we explore the role of such models in enabling real-time sensor fusion, language-conditioned control, and adaptive task execution. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications in the domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation sectors, demonstrating the transformative impact of foundation models on service robotics. We also include potential future research directions, emphasizing the need for predictive scaling laws, autonomous long-term adaptation, and cross-embodiment generalization to enable scalable, efficient, and robust deployment of foundation models in human-centric robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring 3D Activity Reasoning and Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D activity reasoning and planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advance in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Identity-Preserving Multi-Person Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18078v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable video generation (CVG) has advanced rapidly, yet current systems falter when more than one actor must move, interact, and exchange positions under noisy control signals. We address this gap with DanceTogether, the first end-to-end diffusion framework that turns a single reference image plus independent pose-mask streams into long, photorealistic videos while strictly preserving every identity. A novel MaskPoseAdapter binds "who" and "how" at every denoising step by fusing robust tracking masks with semantically rich-but noisy-pose heat-maps, eliminating the identity drift and appearance bleeding that plague frame-wise pipelines. To train and evaluate at scale, we introduce (i) PairFS-4K, 26 hours of dual-skater footage with 7,000+ distinct IDs, (ii) HumanRob-300, a one-hour humanoid-robot interaction set for rapid cross-domain transfer, and (iii) TogetherVideoBench, a three-track benchmark centered on the DanceTogEval-100 test suite covering dance, boxing, wrestling, yoga, and figure skating. On TogetherVideoBench, DanceTogether outperforms the prior arts by a significant margin. Moreover, we show that a one-hour fine-tune yields convincing human-robot videos, underscoring broad generalization to embodied-AI and HRI tasks. Extensive ablations confirm that persistent identity-action binding is critical to these gains. Together, our model, datasets, and benchmark lift CVG from single-subject choreography to compositionally controllable, multi-actor interaction, opening new avenues for digital production, simulation, and embodied intelligence.

To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions.

| **[Perceptual Quality Assessment for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16815v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI has developed rapidly in recent years, but it is still mainly deployed in laboratories, with various distortions in the Real-world limiting its application. Traditionally, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are applied to predict human preferences for distorted images; however, there is no IQA method to assess the usability of an image in embodied tasks, namely, the perceptual quality for robots. To provide accurate and reliable quality indicators for future embodied scenarios, we first propose the topic: IQA for Embodied AI. Specifically, we (1) based on the Mertonian system and meta-cognitive theory, constructed a perception-cognition-decision-execution pipeline and defined a comprehensive subjective score collection process; (2) established the Embodied-IQA database, containing over 36k reference/distorted image pairs, with more than 5m fine-grained annotations provided by Vision Language Models/Vision Language Action-models/Real-world robots; (3) trained and validated the performance of mainstream IQA methods on Embodied-IQA, demonstrating the need to develop more accurate quality indicators for Embodied AI. We sincerely hope that through evaluation, we can promote the application of Embodied AI under complex distortions in the Real-world.

This paper shows that VLMs can achieve surprisingly strong decision-making performance when visual scenes are represented merely as text-only descriptions, suggesting foundational reasoning can be effectively learned from language. Motivated by this insight, we propose Praxis-VLM, a reasoning VLM for vision-grounded decision-making. Praxis-VLM employs the GRPO algorithm on textual scenarios to instill robust reasoning capabilities, where models learn to evaluate actions and their consequences. These reasoning skills, acquired purely from text, successfully transfer to multimodal inference with visual inputs, significantly reducing reliance on scarce paired image-text training data. Experiments across diverse decision-making benchmarks demonstrate that Praxis-VLM substantially outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning, exhibiting superior performance and generalizability. Further analysis confirms that our models engage in explicit and effective reasoning, underpinning their enhanced performance and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

Recent success of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates that specialization of parameters enables strong scalability. In this work, we propose DriveMoE, a novel MoE-based E2E-AD framework, with a Scene-Specialized Vision MoE and a Skill-Specialized Action MoE. DriveMoE is built upon our $\pi_0$ Vision-Language-Action (VLA) baseline (originally from the embodied AI field), called Drive-$\pi_0$. Specifically, we add Vision MoE to Drive-$\pi_0$ by training a router to select relevant cameras according to the driving context dynamically. This design mirrors human driving cognition, where drivers selectively attend to crucial visual cues rather than exhaustively processing all visual information. In addition, we add Action MoE by training another router to activate specialized expert modules for different driving behaviors. Through explicit behavioral specialization, DriveMoE is able to handle diverse scenarios without suffering from modes averaging like existing models. In Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation experiments, DriveMoE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining vision and action MoE in autonomous driving tasks. We will release our code and models of DriveMoE and Drive-$\pi_0$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://thinklab-sjtu.github.io/DriveMoE/</p></details> |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

However, current co-speech gesture generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (\textit{e.g.} speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Intentional-Gesture}, a novel framework that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in high-level communicative functions. % First, we curate the \textbf{InG} dataset by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (\textit{i.e.}, text sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the \textbf{Intentional Gesture Motion Tokenizer} to leverage these intention annotations. It injects high-level communicative functions (\textit{e.g.}, intentions) into tokenized motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture</p></details> |  |

However, the capability of existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend and reason about such panoramic scenes remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing OmniVQA, the first dataset and conducting the first benchmark for omnidirectional visual question answering. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant limitations in handling omnidirectional visual question answering, highlighting persistent challenges in object localization, feature extraction, and hallucination suppression within panoramic contexts. These results underscore the disconnect between current MLLM capabilities and the demands of omnidirectional visual understanding, which calls for dedicated architectural or training innovations tailored to 360{\deg} imagery. Building on the OmniVQA dataset and benchmark, we further introduce a rule-based reinforcement learning method, 360-R1, based on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct. Concretely, we modify the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by proposing three novel reward functions: (1) reasoning process similarity reward, (2) answer semantic accuracy reward, and (3) structured format compliance reward. Extensive experiments on our OmniVQA demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in omnidirectional space (+6% improvement).</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code are be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</p></details> |  |

Yet progress has been limited by the absence of large-scale, real-time, multi-modal, and socially interactive datasets that reflect the sensory-motor complexity of natural environments. To address this, we present PLAICraft, a novel data collection platform and dataset capturing multiplayer Minecraft interactions across five time-aligned modalities: video, game output audio, microphone input audio, mouse, and keyboard actions. Each modality is logged with millisecond time precision, enabling the study of synchronous, embodied behaviour in a rich, open-ended world. The dataset comprises over 10,000 hours of gameplay from more than 10,000 global participants.\footnote{We have done a privacy review for the public release of an initial 200-hour subset of the dataset, with plans to release most of the dataset over time.} Alongside the dataset, we provide an evaluation suite for benchmarking model capabilities in object recognition, spatial awareness, language grounding, and long-term memory. PLAICraft opens a path toward training and evaluating agents that act fluently and purposefully in real time, paving the way for truly embodied artificial intelligence.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |
| **[EWMBench: Evaluating Scene, Motion, and Semantic Quality in Embodied World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09694v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in creative AI have enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images and videos conditioned on language instructions. Building on these developments, text-to-video diffusion models have evolved into embodied world models (EWMs) capable of generating physically plausible scenes from language commands, effectively bridging vision and action in embodied AI applications. This work addresses the critical challenge of evaluating EWMs beyond general perceptual metrics to ensure the generation of physically grounded and action-consistent behaviors. We propose the Embodied World Model Benchmark (EWMBench), a dedicated framework designed to evaluate EWMs based on three key aspects: visual scene consistency, motion correctness, and semantic alignment. Our approach leverages a meticulously curated dataset encompassing diverse scenes and motion patterns, alongside a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation toolkit, to assess and compare candidate models. The proposed benchmark not only identifies the limitations of existing video generation models in meeting the unique requirements of embodied tasks but also provides valuable insights to guide future advancements in the field.

| **[Emergent Active Perception and Dexterity of Simulated Humanoids from Visual Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12278v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human behavior is fundamentally shaped by visual perception -- our ability to interact with the world depends on actively gathering relevant information and adapting our movements accordingly. Behaviors like searching for objects, reaching, and hand-eye coordination naturally emerge from the structure of our sensory system. Inspired by these principles, we introduce Perceptive Dexterous Control (PDC), a framework for vision-driven dexterous whole-body control with simulated humanoids. PDC operates solely on egocentric vision for task specification, enabling object search, target placement, and skill selection through visual cues, without relying on privileged state information (e.g., 3D object positions and geometries). This perception-as-interface paradigm enables learning a single policy to perform multiple household tasks, including reaching, grasping, placing, and articulated object manipulation. We also show that training from scratch with reinforcement learning can produce emergent behaviors such as active search. These results demonstrate how vision-driven control and complex tasks induce human-like behaviors and can serve as the key ingredients in closing the perception-action loop for animation, robotics, and embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zhengyiluo.github.io/PDC</p></details> |
| **[Are Multimodal Large Language Models Ready for Omnidirectional Spatial Reasoning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11907v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 180x360 omnidirectional field of view captured by 360-degree cameras enables their use in a wide range of applications such as embodied AI and virtual reality. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in visual-spatial reasoning, most studies focus on standard pinhole-view images, leaving omnidirectional perception largely unexplored. In this paper, we ask: Are MLLMs ready for omnidirectional spatial reasoning? To investigate this, we introduce OSR-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed for this setting. OSR-Bench includes over 153,000 diverse question-answer pairs grounded in high-fidelity panoramic indoor scene maps. It covers key reasoning types including object counting, relative distance, and direction. We also propose a negative sampling strategy that inserts non-existent objects into prompts to evaluate hallucination and grounding robustness. For fine-grained analysis, we design a two-stage evaluation framework assessing both cognitive map generation and QA accuracy using rotation-invariant matching and a combination of rule-based and LLM-based metrics. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and leading open-source models under zero-shot settings. Results show that current models struggle with spatial reasoning in panoramic contexts, highlighting the need for more perceptually grounded MLLMs. OSR-Bench and code will be released at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/UUUserna/OSR-Bench</p></details> |  |

These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: Foundation Models (FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas Federated Learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied environments. In this vision paper, we introduce Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed nature of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical deployment dimensions of FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning, Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for deploying FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Brooks 1991; Pfeifer and Scheier 2001). We claim that the AI-powered robots are only weakly embodied and inherit some of the problems of GOFAI. Moreover, we review and critically discuss the possibility of cross-embodiment learning (Padalkar et al. 2024). We identify fundamental roadblocks and propose directions on how to make progress.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

However, the proliferation of vendor-specific proprietary communication libraries creates significant interoperability barriers, hindering seamless collaboration between different accelerator types and leading to suboptimal resource utilization and performance bottlenecks in distributed AI workloads. This paper introduces KAITIAN, a novel distributed communication framework designed to bridge this gap. KAITIAN provides a unified abstraction layer that intelligently integrates vendor-optimized communication libraries for intra-group efficiency with general-purpose communication protocols for inter-group interoperability. Crucially, it incorporates a load-adaptive scheduling mechanism that dynamically balances computational tasks across heterogeneous devices based on their real-time performance characteristics. Implemented as an extension to PyTorch and rigorously evaluated on a testbed featuring NVIDIA GPUs and Cambricon MLUs, KAITIAN demonstrates significant improvements in resource utilization and scalability for distributed training tasks. Experimental results show that KAITIAN can accelerate training time by up to 42% compared to baseline homogeneous systems, while incurring minimal communication overhead (2.8--4.3%) and maintaining model accuracy. KAITIAN paves the way for more flexible and powerful heterogeneous computing in complex embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

Current approaches suffer from significant domain gaps between training datasets and robot manipulation tasks, while also lacking model architectures that can effectively incorporate 3D information. To overcome these limitations, we enhance the DROID dataset with high-quality depth maps and point clouds, constructing DROID-3D as a valuable supplement for 3D embodied vision research. Then we develop EmbodiedMAE, a multi-modal masked autoencoder that simultaneously learns representations across RGB, depth, and point cloud modalities through stochastic masking and cross-modal fusion. Trained on DROID-3D, EmbodiedMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art vision foundation models (VFMs) in both training efficiency and final performance across 70 simulation tasks and 20 real-world robot manipulation tasks on two robot platforms. The model exhibits strong scaling behavior with size and promotes effective policy learning from 3D inputs. Experimental results establish EmbodiedMAE as a reliable unified 3D multi-modal VFM for embodied AI systems, particularly in precise tabletop manipulation settings where spatial perception is critical.</p></details> |  |

However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

While curriculum learning has demonstrated success in single-agent domains, principled approaches for multi-agent coordination remain limited due to the absence of validated task complexity metrics. This approach presents a graph-based coordination complexity metric that integrates agent dependency entropy, spatial interference patterns, and goal overlap analysis to predict task difficulty in multi-agent environments. The complexity metric achieves strong empirical validation with rho = 0.952 correlation (p < 0.001) between predicted complexity and empirical difficulty determined by random agent performance evaluation. This approach evaluates the curriculum learning framework using MADDPG across two distinct coordination environments: achieving 56x performance improvement in tight coordination tasks (MultiWalker) and demonstrating systematic task progression in cooperative navigation (Simple Spread). Through systematic analysis, coordination tightness emerges as a predictor of curriculum learning effectiveness, where environments requiring strict agent interdependence benefit substantially from structured progression. This approach provides a validated complexity metric for multi-agent curriculum design and establishes empirical guidelines for multi-robot coordination applications.</p></details> | 6 Pages, 3 Figures |

We propose FR3E (First Return, Entropy-Eliciting Explore), a structured exploration framework that identifies high-uncertainty decision points in reasoning trajectories and performs targeted rollouts to construct semantically grounded intermediate feedback. Our method provides targeted guidance without relying on dense supervision. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks(AIME24) show that FR3E promotes more stable training, produces longer and more coherent responses, and increases the proportion of fully correct trajectories. These results highlight the framework's effectiveness in improving LLM reasoning through more robust and structured exploration.</p></details> |  |

At each cell, a base station (BS) operates as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent that interacts with the surrounding environment to maximize the secrecy rate of legitimate users in the presence of an eavesdropper. This eavesdropper attempts to intercept the confidential information shared between the BS and its authorized users. The DRL agents are deemed to be federated since they only share their network parameters with a central server and not the private data of their legitimate users. Two DRL approaches, deep Q-network (DQN) and Reinforce deep policy gradient (RDPG), are explored and compared. The results demonstrate that RDPG converges more rapidly than DQN. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the distributed DRL approach. Furthermore, the outcomes illustrate the trade-off between security and complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Cognitive Networks: Reinforcement Learning Meets Energy Harvesting Over Cascaded Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06981v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to improve the physical layer security (PLS) of an underlay cognitive radio network (CRN) over cascaded channels. These channels are utilized in highly mobile networks such as cognitive vehicular networks (CVN). In addition, an eavesdropper aims to intercept the communications between secondary users (SUs). The SU receiver has full-duplex and energy harvesting capabilities to generate jamming signals to confound the eavesdropper and enhance security. Moreover, the SU transmitter extracts energy from ambient radio frequency signals in order to power subsequent transmissions to its intended receiver. To optimize the privacy and reliability of the SUs in a CVN, a deep Q-network (DQN) strategy is utilized where multiple DQN agents are required such that an agent is assigned at each SU transmitter. The objective for the SUs is to determine the optimal transmission power and decide whether to collect energy or transmit messages during each time period in order to maximize their secrecy rate. Thereafter, we propose a DQN approach to maximize the throughput of the SUs while respecting the interference threshold acceptable at the receiver of the primary user. According to our findings, our strategy outperforms two other baseline strategies in terms of security and reliability.</p></details> |  |

However, IPP is often applied in scenarios where anomalies, such as plant diseases, pollution, or hurricane damage, appear in clusters. In such cases, prioritizing the exploration of anomalous regions over uniform coverage is beneficial. This work introduces a class of algorithms referred to as bounom\=odes ("as the ox grazes"), which alternates between uniform boustrophedon sampling and targeted exploration of detected anomaly clusters. While uniform sampling can be designed using geometric principles, close exploration of clusters depends on the spatial distribution of anomalies and must be learned. In our implementation, the close exploration behavior is learned using deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several established baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Verification for LLM Code Generation: From Generation to Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06920v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method (SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability, aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc) of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78% higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis and adaptive benchmark integration.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a general framework for wireless Coexistence Parameter Management (CPM) based on state-augmented constrained reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm, QaSAL-CPM, which incorporates state-augmentation by embedding the dual variables in the constrained optimization formulation directly into the agent's observation space. This method enables the agent to respond to constraint violations in real time while continuing to optimize a primary performance objective. Through extensive simulations of 5G NR-U and Wi-Fi coexistence scenarios, we show that QaSAL-CPM achieves reliable QoS compliance and improved policy robustness across various transmitter densities compared to previous approaches. The proposed framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution for real-time coexistence optimization in next-generation wireless networks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

A significant hurdle is the current lack of standardized infrastructure, which hinders integrating diverse tools, generating rich interaction data, and training robust agents effectively. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenThinkIMG, the first open-source, comprehensive end-to-end framework for tool-augmented LVLMs. It features standardized vision tool interfaces, scalable trajectory generation for policy initialization, and a flexible training environment. Furthermore, considering supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on static demonstrations offers limited policy generalization for dynamic tool invocation, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework V-ToolRL to train LVLMs to learn adaptive policies for invoking external vision tools. V-ToolRL enables LVLMs to autonomously discover optimal tool-usage strategies by directly optimizing for task success using feedback from tool interactions. We empirically validate V-ToolRL on challenging chart reasoning tasks. Our RL-trained agent, built upon a Qwen2-VL-2B, significantly outperforms its SFT-initialized counterpart (+28.83 points) and surpasses established supervised tool-learning baselines like Taco and CogCom by an average of +12.7 points. Notably, it also surpasses prominent closed-source models like GPT-4.1 by +8.68 accuracy points. We hope OpenThinkIMG can serve as a foundational framework for advancing dynamic, tool-augmented visual reasoning, helping the community develop AI agents that can genuinely "think with images".</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Designing Adaptive Algorithms Based on Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Optimization of Sliding Window Size in Multi-Dimensional Data Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06901v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-dimensional data streams, prevalent in applications like IoT, financial markets, and real-time analytics, pose significant challenges due to their high velocity, unbounded nature, and complex inter-dimensional dependencies. Sliding window techniques are critical for processing such streams, but fixed-size windows struggle to adapt to dynamic changes like concept drift or bursty patterns. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach to dynamically optimize sliding window sizes for multi-dimensional data streams. By formulating window size selection as an RL problem, we enable an agent to learn an adaptive policy based on stream characteristics, such as variance, correlations, and temporal trends. Our method, RL-Window, leverages a Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) with prioritized experience replay to handle non-stationarity and high-dimensionality. Evaluations on benchmark datasets (UCI HAR, PAMAP2, Yahoo! Finance Stream) demonstrate that RL-Window outperforms state-of-the-art methods like ADWIN and CNN-Adaptive in classification accuracy, drift robustness, and computational efficiency. Additional qualitative analyses, extended metrics (e.g., energy efficiency, latency), and a comprehensive dataset characterization further highlight its adaptability and stability, making it suitable for real-time applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Squeeze the Soaked Sponge: Efficient Off-policy Reinforcement Finetuning for Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06892v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time, posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2) KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with 0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version.

These episodes start with different resource amounts, and the contexts' probability distributions are non-stationary in an episode. All episodes share the same latent conversion model, which governs the random outcome contingent upon a request's context and an allocation decision. Our model captures applications such as dynamic pricing on perishable resources with episodic replenishment, and first price auctions in repeated episodes with different starting budgets. We design an online algorithm that achieves a regret sub-linear in $T$, the number of episodes, assuming access to a \emph{confidence bound oracle} that achieves an $o(T)$-regret. Such an oracle is readily available from existing contextual bandit literature. We overcome the technical challenge with arbitrarily many possible contexts, which leads to a reinforcement learning problem with an unbounded state space. Our framework provides improved regret bounds in certain settings when the DM is provided with unlabeled feature data, which is novel to the contextual BwK literature.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging ensemble learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL) framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while optimizing their aggregation after the fine-tuning to improve efficiency and flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the hidden states of individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor reflection generation tasks, using text classification models to score the generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds), improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across multiple objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, accepted by the SIGDIAL 2025 conference</p></details> |

Unlike rigid tools, articulated tools change their shape dynamically, creating unique challenges for dexterous robotic hands. In this work, we present a hierarchical, goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) framework to improve the manipulation capabilities of anthropomorphic robotic hands using articulated tools. Our framework comprises two policy layers: (1) a low-level policy that enables the dexterous hand to manipulate the tool into various configurations for objects of different sizes, and (2) a high-level policy that defines the tool's goal state and controls the robotic arm for object-picking tasks. We employ an encoder, trained on synthetic pointclouds, to estimate the tool's affordance states--specifically, how different tool configurations (e.g., tweezer opening angles) enable grasping of objects of varying sizes--from input point clouds, thereby enabling precise tool manipulation. We also utilize a privilege-informed heuristic policy to generate replay buffer, improving the training efficiency of the high-level policy. We validate our approach through real-world experiments, showing that the robot can effectively manipulate a tweezer-like tool to grasp objects of diverse shapes and sizes with a 70.8 % success rate. This study highlights the potential of RL to advance dexterous robotic manipulation of articulated tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025). copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[Noise tolerance via reinforcement: Learning a reinforced quantum dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12418v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of quantum simulations heavily depends on the efficiency of noise mitigation techniques and error correction algorithms. Reinforcement has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the efficiency of learning and optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that a reinforced quantum dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy environment. We study a quantum annealing process where, through reinforcement, the system is encouraged to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free evolution. A learning algorithm is employed to derive a concise approximation of this reinforced dynamics, reducing the total evolution time and, consequently, the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This also avoids the complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such reinforcement algorithms. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of reinforced quantum annealing with one- and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.</p></details> | 25 pages, 12 figures |

The formulation of the method takes advantage of results connecting performance to bounds for the KL-divergence between demonstrated and learned policies, and its objective is rigorously justified through a connection to a probabilistic inference framework for reinforcement learning, incorporating the reinforcement learning objective and the objective to abide by constraints in an entropy maximization setting. The proposed algorithm optimizes the learning objective with dual gradient descent, supporting effective and stable training. Experiments show that the proposed method can learn effective policy models for constraints-abiding behaviour, in settings with multiple constraints of different types, accommodating different modalities of demonstrated behaviour, and with abilities to generalize.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning-based Feature Generation Algorithm for Scientific Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03498v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature generation (FG) aims to enhance the prediction potential of original data by constructing high-order feature combinations and removing redundant features. It is a key preprocessing step for tabular scientific data to improve downstream machine-learning model performance. Traditional methods face the following two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific data: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in scientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise. Secondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space expands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption. Advancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have opened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by that, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in the iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical transformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature combinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement learning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration phase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively evaluate the generated features of each significant model performance breakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate that the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process and significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, in Chinese language, accepted by Journal of Computer Research and Development</p></details> |
| **[Multi-parameter Control for the $(1+(λ,λ))$-GA on OneMax via Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12982v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that evolutionary algorithms can benefit from dynamic choices of the key parameters that control their behavior, to adjust their search strategy to the different stages of the optimization process. A prominent example where dynamic parameter choices have shown a provable super-constant speed-up is the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing the OneMax function. While optimal parameter control policies result in linear expected running times, this is not possible with static parameter choices. This result has spurred a lot of interest in parameter control policies. However, many works, in particular theoretical running time analyses, focus on controlling one single parameter. Deriving policies for controlling multiple parameters remains very challenging. In this work we reconsider the problem of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing OneMax. We decouple its four main parameters and investigate how well state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning techniques can approximate good control policies. We show that although making deep reinforcement learning learn effectively is a challenging task, once it works, it is very powerful and is able to find policies that outperform all previously known control policies on the same benchmark. Based on the results found through reinforcement learning, we derive a simple control policy that consistently outperforms the default theory-recommended setting by $27\%$ and the irace-tuned policy, the strongest existing control policy on this benchmark, by $13\%$, for all tested problem sizes up to $40{,}000$.</p></details> |  |

However, it faces challenges such as limited bandwidth, latency fluctuations, and high packet loss. To address these issues, we propose a novel semantic self-correcting video transmission framework with ultra-fine bitrate granularity (SSCV-G). In SSCV-G, video frames are encoded into a compact semantic codebook space, and the transmitter adaptively sends a subset of semantic indices based on bandwidth availability, enabling fine-grained bitrate control for improved bandwidth efficiency. At the receiver, a spatio-temporal vision transformer (ST-ViT) performs multi-frame joint decoding to reconstruct dropped semantic indices by modeling intra- and inter-frame dependencies. To further improve performance under dynamic network conditions, we integrate a multi-user proximal policy optimization (MUPPO) reinforcement learning scheme that jointly optimizes communication resource allocation and semantic bitrate selection to maximize user Quality of Experience (QoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SSCV-G significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video codecs in coding efficiency, bandwidth adaptability, and packet loss robustness. Moreover, the proposed MUPPO-based QoE optimization consistently surpasses existing benchmarks.</p></details> | 13 pages |

To address this, we introduce Quality Diversity Inverse Reinforcement Learning (QD-IRL), a novel framework that integrates quality-diversity optimization with IRL methods, enabling agents to learn diverse behaviors from limited demonstrations. This work introduces Extrinsic Behavioral Curiosity (EBC), which allows agents to receive additional curiosity rewards from an external critic based on how novel the behaviors are with respect to a large behavioral archive. To validate the effectiveness of EBC in exploring diverse locomotion behaviors, we evaluate our method on multiple robot locomotion tasks. EBC improves the performance of QD-IRL instances with GAIL, VAIL, and DiffAIL across all included environments by up to 185%, 42%, and 150%, even surpassing expert performance by 20% in Humanoid. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EBC is applicable to Gradient-Arborescence-based Quality Diversity Reinforcement Learning (QD-RL) algorithms, where it substantially improves performance and provides a generic technique for diverse robot locomotion.

| **[Value from Observations: Towards Large-Scale Imitation Learning via Self-Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06701v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation Learning from Observation (IfO) offers a powerful way to learn behaviors at large-scale: Unlike behavior cloning or offline reinforcement learning, IfO can leverage action-free demonstrations and thus circumvents the need for costly action-labeled demonstrations or reward functions. However, current IfO research focuses on idealized scenarios with mostly bimodal-quality data distributions, restricting the meaningfulness of the results. In contrast, this paper investigates more nuanced distributions and introduces a method to learn from such data, moving closer to a paradigm in which imitation learning can be performed iteratively via self-improvement. Our method adapts RL-based imitation learning to action-free demonstrations, using a value function to transfer information between expert and non-expert data. Through comprehensive evaluation, we delineate the relation between different data distributions and the applicability of algorithms and highlight the limitations of established methods. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and practical IfO techniques on a path to scalable behaviour learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Uncertainty for Safe Social Navigation using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10655v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous mobile robots are increasingly used in pedestrian-rich environments where safe navigation and appropriate human interaction are crucial. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables socially integrated robot behavior, challenges persist in novel or perturbed scenarios to indicate when and why the policy is uncertain. Unknown uncertainty in decision-making can lead to collisions or human discomfort and is one reason why safe and risk-aware navigation is still an open problem. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates aleatoric, epistemic, and predictive uncertainty estimation into a DRL navigation framework for policy distribution uncertainty estimates. We, therefore, incorporate Observation-Dependent Variance (ODV) and dropout into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. For different types of perturbations, we compare the ability of deep ensembles and Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) to estimate the uncertainties of the policy. In uncertain decision-making situations, we propose to change the robot's social behavior to conservative collision avoidance. The results show improved training performance with ODV and dropout in PPO and reveal that the training scenario has an impact on the generalization. In addition, MC-dropout is more sensitive to perturbations and correlates the uncertainty type to the perturbation better. With the safe action selection, the robot can navigate in perturbed environments with fewer collisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 8 pages, 6 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |

However, current offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods face substantial challenges when applied to sparse advertising scenarios, primarily due to severe overestimation, distributional shifts, and overlooking budget constraints. To address these issues, we propose MTORL, a novel multi-task offline RL model that targets two key objectives. First, we establish a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework specific to the nuances of advertising. Then, we develop a causal state encoder to capture dynamic user interests and temporal dependencies, facilitating offline RL through conditional sequence modeling. Causal attention mechanisms are introduced to enhance user sequence representations by identifying correlations among causal states. We employ multi-task learning to decode actions and rewards, simultaneously addressing channel recommendation and budget allocation. Notably, our framework includes an automated system for integrating these tasks into online advertising. Extensive experiments on offline and online environments demonstrate MTORL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |

One method for improving robustness is unsupervised environment design (UED), a suite of methods aiming to maximise an agent's generalisability across configurations of an environment. In this work, we study UED from an optimisation perspective, providing stronger theoretical guarantees for practical settings than prior work. Whereas previous methods relied on guarantees if they reach convergence, our framework employs a nonconvex-strongly-concave objective for which we provide a provably convergent algorithm in the zero-sum setting. We empirically verify the efficacy of our method, outperforming prior methods in a number of environments with varying difficulties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reinf...</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning Conference 2025</p></details> |

However, it is challenging for existing multi-task learning methods to handle complex problems, as they are unable to handle unrelated tasks and possess limited knowledge transfer capabilities. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical approach that efficiently addresses these challenges. The high-level module utilizes a skill graph, while the low-level module employs a standard MARL algorithm. Our approach offers two contributions. First, we consider the MT-MARL problem in the context of unrelated tasks, expanding the scope of MTRL. Second, the skill graph is used as the upper layer of the standard hierarchical approach, with training independent of the lower layer, effectively handling unrelated tasks and enhancing knowledge transfer capabilities. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate these advantages and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the latest hierarchical MAPPO algorithms.

However, it faces significant challenges in effectively sharing knowledge across tasks. Inspired by the efficient knowledge abstraction observed in human learning, we propose Goal-Oriented Skill Abstraction (GO-Skill), a novel approach designed to extract and utilize reusable skills to enhance knowledge transfer and task performance. Our approach uncovers reusable skills through a goal-oriented skill extraction process and leverages vector quantization to construct a discrete skill library. To mitigate class imbalances between broadly applicable and task-specific skills, we introduce a skill enhancement phase to refine the extracted skills. Furthermore, we integrate these skills using hierarchical policy learning, enabling the construction of a high-level policy that dynamically orchestrates discrete skills to accomplish specific tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse robotic manipulation tasks within the MetaWorld benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of GO-Skill.</p></details> | ICML2025 |
| **[Q-STAC: Q-Guided Stein Variational Model Predictive Actor-Critic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06625v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning has shown remarkable success in continuous control tasks, yet often requires extensive training data, struggles with complex, long-horizon planning, and fails to maintain safety constraints during operation. Meanwhile, Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers explainability and constraint satisfaction, but typically yields only locally optimal solutions and demands careful cost function design. This paper introduces the Q-guided STein variational model predictive Actor-Critic (Q-STAC), a novel framework that bridges these approaches by integrating Bayesian MPC with actor-critic reinforcement learning through constrained Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD). Our method optimizes control sequences directly using learned Q-values as objectives, eliminating the need for explicit cost function design while leveraging known system dynamics to enhance sample efficiency and ensure control signals remain within safe boundaries. Extensive experiments on 2D navigation and robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that Q-STAC achieves superior sample efficiency, robustness, and optimality compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, while maintaining the high expressiveness of policy distributions.

| **[Efficient Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning with Cross-Task Policy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06615v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task reinforcement learning endeavors to efficiently leverage shared information across various tasks, facilitating the simultaneous learning of multiple tasks. Existing approaches primarily focus on parameter sharing with carefully designed network structures or tailored optimization procedures. However, they overlook a direct and complementary way to exploit cross-task similarities: the control policies of tasks already proficient in some skills can provide explicit guidance for unmastered tasks to accelerate skills acquisition. To this end, we present a novel framework called Cross-Task Policy Guidance (CTPG), which trains a guide policy for each task to select the behavior policy interacting with the environment from all tasks' control policies, generating better training trajectories. In addition, we propose two gating mechanisms to improve the learning efficiency of CTPG: one gate filters out control policies that are not beneficial for guidance, while the other gate blocks tasks that do not necessitate guidance. CTPG is a general framework adaptable to existing parameter sharing approaches. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that incorporating CTPG with these approaches significantly enhances performance in manipulation and locomotion benchmarks.</p></details> | NeurIPS2024 |
| **[Decoder-Hybrid-Decoder Architecture for Efficient Reasoning with Long Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06607v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We release our training codebase on open-source data at https://github.com/microsoft/ArchScale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Growing Trees with an Agent: Accelerating RRTs with Learned, Multi-Step Episodic Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06605v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical sampling-based motion planners like the RRTs suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in cluttered or high-dimensional spaces, due to their reliance on undirected, random sampling. This paper introduces the Episodic RRT, a novel hybrid planning framework that replaces the primitive of a random point with a learned, multi-step "exploratory episode" generated by a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent. By making the DRL agent the engine of exploration, ERRT transforms the search process from a diffuse, volumetric expansion into a directed, branch-like growth. This paradigm shift yields key advantages: it counters the curse of dimensionality with focused exploration, minimizes expensive collision checks by proactively proposing locally valid paths, and improves connectivity by generating inherently connected path segments. We demonstrate through extensive empirical evaluation across 2D, 3D, and 6D environments that ERRT and its variants consistently and significantly outperform their classical counterparts. In a challenging 6D robotic arm scenario, ERRT achieves a 98% success rate compared to 19% for RRT, is up to 107x faster, reduces collision checks by over 99.6%, and finds initial paths that are nearly 50% shorter. Furthermore, its asymptotically optimal variant, ERRT*, demonstrates vastly superior anytime performance, refining solutions to near-optimality up to 29x faster than standard RRT* in 3D environments.

| **[Generalization in Reinforcement Learning for Radio Access Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06602v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern RAN operate in highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments, where hand-tuned, rule-based RRM algorithms often underperform. While RL can surpass such heuristics in constrained settings, the diversity of deployments and unpredictable radio conditions introduce major generalization challenges. Data-driven policies frequently overfit to training conditions, degrading performance in unseen scenarios. To address this, we propose a generalization-centered RL framework for RAN control that: (i) encodes cell topology and node attributes via attention-based graph representations; (ii) applies domain randomization to broaden the training distribution; and (iii) distributes data generation across multiple actors while centralizing training in a cloud-compatible architecture aligned with O-RAN principles. Although generalization increases computational and data-management complexity, our distributed design mitigates this by scaling data collection and training across diverse network conditions. Applied to downlink link adaptation in five 5G benchmarks, our policy improves average throughput and spectral efficiency by ~10% over an OLLA baseline (10% BLER target) in full-buffer MIMO/mMIMO and by >20% under high mobility. It matches specialized RL in full-buffer traffic and achieves up to 4- and 2-fold gains in eMBB and mixed-traffic benchmarks, respectively. In nine-cell deployments, GAT models offer 30% higher throughput over MLP baselines. These results, combined with our scalable architecture, offer a path toward AI-native 6G RAN using a single, generalizable RL agent.</p></details> |  |

However, research applying these advances to the financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO (Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our framework, we train the FEVO series of models - C32B, S32B, R32B - from Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation</p></details> |  |

However, their nonlinear and hysteretic behavior, resulting from the properties of soft materials, presents substantial challenges for accurate modeling and control. In this study, we present a soft robotic system designed for surgical applications and propose a hysteresis-aware whole-body neural network model that accurately captures and predicts the soft robot's whole-body motion, including its hysteretic behavior. Building upon the high-precision dynamic model, we construct a highly parallel simulation environment for soft robot control and apply an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm to efficiently train whole-body motion control strategies. Based on the trained control policy, we developed a soft robotic system for surgical applications and validated it through phantom-based laser ablation experiments in a physical environment. The results demonstrate that the hysteresis-aware modeling reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 84.95 percent compared to traditional modeling methods. The deployed control algorithm achieved a trajectory tracking error ranging from 0.126 to 0.250 mm on the real soft robot, highlighting its precision in real-world conditions. The proposed method showed strong performance in phantom-based surgical experiments and demonstrates its potential for complex scenarios, including future real-world clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated author affiliation</p></details> |

However, such models are not always available, but may sometimes be learned by exploring an environment. In this work, we investigate using an information measure called "predicted information gain" to determine the most informative regions of an environment to explore next. Applying methods from reinforcement learning allows good suboptimal exploring policies to be found, and leads to reliable estimates of the underlying controllable dynamics. This approach is demonstrated by comparing with several myopic exploration approaches.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has emphasized algorithmic design, data curation, and reward shaping, we investigate RLVR from a sample-centric perspective and introduce LPPO (Learning-Progress and Prefix-guided Optimization), a framework of progressive optimization techniques. Our work addresses a critical question: how to best leverage a small set of trusted, high-quality demonstrations, rather than simply scaling up data volume. First, motivated by how hints aid human problem-solving, we propose prefix-guided sampling, an online data augmentation method that incorporates partial solution prefixes from expert demonstrations to guide the policy, particularly for challenging instances. Second, inspired by how humans focus on important questions aligned with their current capabilities, we introduce learning-progress weighting, a dynamic strategy that adjusts each training sample's influence based on model progression. We estimate sample-level learning progress via an exponential moving average of per-sample pass rates, promoting samples that foster learning and de-emphasizing stagnant ones. Experiments on mathematical-reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform strong baselines, yielding faster convergence and a higher performance ceiling.</p></details> | Work in progress |

For example, prior work benchmarking the performance of multilingual LLMs on code-mixed translation tasks has demonstrated that current state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs are ineffective in dealing with code-mixed languages. However, the question of how to improve the capability of multilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed language has not received any attention to date. In this paper, we tackle this research gap by proposing CHAI, a novel general-purpose framework for improving the ability of multilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed languages. CHAI relies on three novel contributions made in this paper. First, we explore the ability of LLMs to provide accurate annotations for code-mixed translation tasks. Second, we leverage this ability of LLMs as annotators to generate preference data for code-mixed translation tasks at scale, which are then used within a reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) procedure to improve LLMs' capability on code-mixed tasks. Third, we conduct a rigorous experimental evaluation across various real-world datasets and settings. Our analysis shows that CHAI-powered LLMs outperform state-of-the-art open-source LLMs by 25.66% (in terms of win rate adjudicated by human annotators) in code-mixed translation tasks. This work represents a first step towards developing more inclusive code-mixed LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>full ...</summary><p>full draft v2: 8 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Extragradient Preference Optimization (EGPO): Beyond Last-Iterate Convergence for Nash Learning from Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08942v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become essential for improving language model capabilities, but traditional approaches rely on the assumption that human preferences follow a transitive Bradley-Terry model. This assumption fails to capture the non-transitive nature of populational human preferences. Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), targeting non-transitive preferences, is a problem of computing the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the two-player constant-sum game defined by the human preference. We introduce Extragradient preference optimization (EGPO), a novel algorithm for NLHF achieving last-iterate linear convergence to the NE of KL-regularized games and polynomial convergence to the NE of original games, while being robust to noise. Unlike previous approaches that rely on nested optimization, we derive an equivalent implementation using gradients of an online variant of the identity preference optimization (IPO) loss, enabling more faithful implementation for neural networks. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate EGPO's superior performance over baseline methods when training for the same number of epochs, as measured by pairwise win-rates using the ground truth preference. These results validate both the theoretical strengths and practical advantages of EGPO for language model alignment with non-transitive human preferences.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |

As a result, expectations are rising for the automation of tasks such as material transport and exploration in unknown environments. However, autonomous locomotion in rough terrains with significant height variations requires vertical movement, and robots capable of performing such movements stably, along with their control methods, have not yet been fully established. In this study, we developed the quadruped robot KLEIYN, which features a waist joint, and aimed to expand quadruped locomotion by enabling chimney climbing through RL. To facilitate the learning of vertical motion, we introduced Contact-Guided Curriculum Learning (CGCL). As a result, KLEIYN successfully climbed walls ranging from 800 mm to 1000 mm in width at an average speed of 150 mm/s, 50 times faster than conventional robots. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the introduction of a waist joint improves climbing performance, particularly enhancing tracking ability on narrow walls.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS2025, website - https://keitayoneda.github.io/kleiyn-chimney-climbing/, YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDmSfkazAvI</p></details> |
| **[A Policy-Gradient Approach to Solving Imperfect-Information Games with Best-Iterate Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00751v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy gradient methods have become a staple of any single-agent reinforcement learning toolbox, due to their combination of desirable properties: iterate convergence, efficient use of stochastic trajectory feedback, and theoretically-sound avoidance of importance sampling corrections. In multi-agent imperfect-information settings (extensive-form games), however, it is still unknown whether the same desiderata can be guaranteed while retaining theoretical guarantees. Instead, sound methods for extensive-form games rely on approximating \emph{counterfactual} values (as opposed to Q values), which are incompatible with policy gradient methodologies. In this paper, we investigate whether policy gradient can be safely used in two-player zero-sum imperfect-information extensive-form games (EFGs). We establish positive results, showing for the first time that a policy gradient method leads to provable best-iterate convergence to a regularized Nash equilibrium in self-play.</p></details> |  |
| **[Failure Forecasting Boosts Robustness of Sim2Real Rhythmic Insertion Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06519v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges of Rhythmic Insertion Tasks (RIT), where a robot must repeatedly perform high-precision insertions, such as screwing a nut into a bolt with a wrench. The inherent difficulty of RIT lies in achieving millimeter-level accuracy and maintaining consistent performance over multiple repetitions, particularly when factors like nut rotation and friction introduce additional complexity. We propose a sim-to-real framework that integrates a reinforcement learning-based insertion policy with a failure forecasting module. By representing the wrench's pose in the nut's coordinate frame rather than the robot's frame, our approach significantly enhances sim-to-real transferability. The insertion policy, trained in simulation, leverages real-time 6D pose tracking to execute precise alignment, insertion, and rotation maneuvers. Simultaneously, a neural network predicts potential execution failures, triggering a simple recovery mechanism that lifts the wrench and retries the insertion. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that our method not only achieves a high one-time success rate but also robustly maintains performance over long-horizon repetitive tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS2025.

| **[Video-RTS: Rethinking Reinforcement Learning and Test-Time Scaling for Efficient and Enhanced Video Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06485v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations, making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2% improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong reasoning performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

| **[Sequential Attention-based Sampling for Histopathological Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05077v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are increasingly applied for automated histopathology. Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering it computationally infeasible to analyze them entirely at high resolution. Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive. Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- {\it S}equential {\it A}ttention-based {\it S}ampling for {\it H}istopathological {\it A}nalysis -- a deep reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second, SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction (10-20\%) of high-resolution patches, to achieve reliable diagnosis. We show that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at high-resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs. In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods. We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images containing sparsely informative features.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTA1: GUI Test-time Scaling Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05791v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms (e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements. Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step. However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning (i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual targets. This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning (RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments, rewarding successful clicks on interface elements. Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7% accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Model Self-Play: Open-Ended Strategy Innovation via Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06466v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent interactions have long fueled innovation, from natural predator-prey dynamics to the space race. Self-play (SP) algorithms try to harness these dynamics by pitting agents against ever-improving opponents, thereby creating an implicit curriculum toward learning high-quality solutions. However, SP often fails to produce diverse solutions and can get stuck in locally optimal behaviors. We introduce Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP), a new direction that leverages the code-generation capabilities and vast knowledge of foundation models (FMs) to overcome these challenges by leaping across local optima in policy space. We propose a family of approaches: (1) \textbf{Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)} continually refines agent policies via competitive self-play; (2) \textbf{Novelty-Search Self-Play (NSSP)} builds a diverse population of strategies, ignoring performance; and (3) the most promising variant, \textbf{Quality-Diveristy Self-Play (QDSP)}, creates a diverse set of high-quality policies by combining the diversity of NSSP and refinement of vFMSP. We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a continuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety simulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car Tag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and heuristic-based methods, to name just a few. In terms of discovered policy quality, \ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies. In Gandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through and jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense. Furthermore, FMSPs can automatically proceed to patch the discovered vulnerabilities. Overall, FMSPs represent a promising new research frontier of improving self-play with foundation models, opening fresh paths toward more creative and open-ended strategy discovery</p></details> | <details><summary>67 pa...</summary><p>67 pages, accepted to RLC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Perception-Aware Policy Optimization for Multimodal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06448v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation, external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages visually grounded reasoning.

| **[Experience-Centric Resource Management in ISAC Networks: A Digital Agent-Assisted Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06436v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a digital agent (DA)-assisted resource management scheme for enhanced user quality of experience (QoE) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. Particularly, user QoE is a comprehensive metric that integrates quality of service (QoS), user behavioral dynamics, and environmental complexity. The novel DA module includes a user status prediction model, a QoS factor selection model, and a QoE fitting model, which analyzes historical user status data to construct and update user-specific QoE models. Users are clustered into different groups based on their QoE models. A Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) model is utilized to quantify the impact of allocated communication resources on sensing accuracy. A joint optimization problem of communication and computing resource management is formulated to maximize long-term user QoE while satisfying CRB and resource constraints. A two-layer data-model-driven algorithm is developed to solve the formulated problem, where the top layer utilizes an advanced deep reinforcement learning algorithm to make group-level decisions, and the bottom layer uses convex optimization techniques to make user-level decisions. Simulation results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed DA-assisted resource management scheme outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of user QoE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Robots Like Human Infants: A Case Study of Learned Bipedal Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06426v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typically, learned robot controllers are trained via relatively unsystematic regimens and evaluated with coarse-grained outcome measures such as average cumulative reward. The typical approach is useful to compare learning algorithms but provides limited insight into the effects of different training regimens and little understanding about the richness and complexity of learned behaviors. Likewise, human infants and other animals are "trained" via unsystematic regimens, but in contrast, developmental psychologists evaluate their performance in highly-controlled experiments with fine-grained measures such as success, speed of walking, and prospective adjustments. However, the study of learned behavior in human infants is limited by the practical constraints of training and testing babies. Here, we present a case study that applies methods from developmental psychology to study the learned behavior of the simulated bipedal robot Cassie. Following research on infant walking, we systematically designed reinforcement learning training regimens and tested the resulting controllers in simulated environments analogous to those used for babies--but without the practical constraints. Results reveal new insights into the behavioral impact of different training regimens and the development of Cassie's learned behaviors relative to infants who are learning to walk. This interdisciplinary baby-robot approach provides inspiration for future research designed to systematically test effects of training on the development of complex learned robot behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted into ICDL 2025 as a contributed paper</p></details> |
| **[The Trilemma of Truth in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23921v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed. To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither. sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their probabilistic internal knowledge.</p></details> |  |

Adaptive DBS (aDBS) offers a closed-loop alternative, using biomarkers such as beta-band oscillations to dynamically modulate stimulation. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for personalized aDBS control, existing methods suffer from high sample complexity, unstable exploration in binary action spaces, and limited deployability on resource-constrained hardware. We propose SEA-DBS, a sample-efficient actor-critic framework that addresses the core challenges of RL-based adaptive neurostimulation. SEA-DBS integrates a predictive reward model to reduce reliance on real-time feedback and employs Gumbel Softmax-based exploration for stable, differentiable policy updates in binary action spaces. Together, these components improve sample efficiency, exploration robustness, and compatibility with resource-constrained neuromodulatory hardware. We evaluate SEA-DBS on a biologically realistic simulation of Parkinsonian basal ganglia activity, demonstrating faster convergence, stronger suppression of pathological beta-band power, and resilience to post-training FP16 quantization. Our results show that SEA-DBS offers a practical and effective RL-based aDBS framework for real-time, resource-constrained neuromodulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE IMC 2025</p></details> |

While prior work has focused on generation and compilation success, little attention has been paid to the critic phase-the evaluation of whether generated formalizations truly capture the semantic intent of the original problem. In this paper, we introduce CriticLean, a novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework that elevates the role of the critic from a passive validator to an active learning component. Specifically, first, we propose the CriticLeanGPT, trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to rigorously assess the semantic fidelity of Lean 4 formalizations. Then, we introduce CriticLeanBench, a benchmark designed to measure models' ability to distinguish semantically correct from incorrect formalizations, and demonstrate that our trained CriticLeanGPT models can significantly outperform strong open- and closed-source baselines. Building on the CriticLean framework, we construct FineLeanCorpus, a dataset comprising over 285K problems that exhibits rich domain diversity, broad difficulty coverage, and high correctness based on human evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight that optimizing the critic phase is essential for producing reliable formalizations, and we hope our CriticLean will provide valuable insights for future advances in formal mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

A tethered tensile perching mechanism offers a simple, adaptable solution that can be retrofitted to existing robots and accommodates a variety of structure sizes and shapes. However, tethered tensile perching introduces significant modelling challenges which require precise management of aerial robot dynamics, including the cases of tether slack & tension, and momentum transfer. Achieving smooth wrapping and secure anchoring by targeting a specific tether segment adds further complexity. In this work, we present a novel trajectory framework for tethered tensile perching, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) through the Soft Actor-Critic from Demonstrations (SACfD) algorithm. By incorporating both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations, our approach enhances training efficiency and responsiveness, achieving precise control over position and velocity. This framework enables the aerial robot to accurately target specific tether segments, facilitating reliable wrapping and secure anchoring. We validate our framework through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, and demonstrate effectiveness in achieving agile and reliable trajectory generation for tensile perching.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated potential in modeling cooperative behaviors, but most RL-based approaches remain constrained to simplified simulations with limited dynamics or fixed scenarios. Previous attempts to deploy RL policy to real-world pursuit-evasion are largely restricted to two-dimensional scenarios, such as ground vehicles or UAVs at fixed altitudes. In this paper, we address multi-UAV pursuit-evasion by considering UAV dynamics and physical constraints. We introduce an evader prediction-enhanced network to tackle partial observability in cooperative strategy learning. Additionally, we propose an adaptive environment generator within MARL training, enabling higher exploration efficiency and better policy generalization across diverse scenarios. Simulations show our method significantly outperforms all baselines in challenging scenarios, generalizing to unseen scenarios with a 100% capture rate. Finally, we derive a feasible policy via a two-stage reward refinement and deploy the policy on real quadrotors in a zero-shot manner. To our knowledge, this is the first work to derive and deploy an RL-based policy using collective thrust and body rates control commands for multi-UAV pursuit-evasion in unknown environments.

Reward learning aims to address this issue by learning the reward function. However, a learned reward model may have a low error on the data distribution, and yet subsequently produce a policy with large regret. We say that such a reward model has an error-regret mismatch. The main source of an error-regret mismatch is the distributional shift that commonly occurs during policy optimization. In this paper, we mathematically show that a sufficiently low expected test error of the reward model guarantees low worst-case regret, but that for any fixed expected test error, there exist realistic data distributions that allow for error-regret mismatch to occur. We then show that similar problems persist even when using policy regularization techniques, commonly employed in methods such as RLHF. We hope our results stimulate the theoretical and empirical study of improved methods to learn reward models, and better ways to measure their quality reliably.</p></details> | 72 pages, 4 figures |

Existing methods, such as domain randomization (DR) and off-dynamics RL, enhance policy robustness by direct interaction with the target domain, an inherently unsafe practice. We propose Uncertainty-Aware RL (UARL), a novel framework that prioritizes safety during training by addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection and policy adaptation without requiring direct interactions in target domain. UARL employs an ensemble of critics to quantify policy uncertainty and incorporates progressive environmental randomization to prepare the policy for diverse real-world conditions. By iteratively refining over high-uncertainty regions of the state space in simulated environments, UARL enhances robust generalization to the target domain without explicitly training on it. We evaluate UARL on MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot, demonstrating its effectiveness in reliable OOD detection, improved performance, and enhanced sample efficiency compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced methods have shown promise in generalization and interoperability, they often neglect necessary multi-agent coordination. Therefore, we introduce the Cascading Cooperative Multi-agent (CCMA) framework, integrating RL for individual interactions, a fine-tuned LLM for regional cooperation, a reward function for global optimization, and the Retrieval-augmented Generation mechanism to dynamically optimize decision-making across complex driving scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the CCMA outperforms existing RL methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both micro and macro-level performance in complex driving environments.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often prove inadequate, causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm (GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE: 87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies, enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization. Overall, the study establishes a solid foundation for using AI in healthcare energy management, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and resilience potential.</p></details> |  |

Although large language models (LLMs) have improved fluency, generating correct and executable SQL, especially for complex queries, continues to be challenging. We introduce CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework and model that produces accurate SQL using a lightweight reward signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance. By avoiding intermediate supervision, hybrid pipelines and complex reward shaping, our method encourages stable learning and stronger alignment with the ultimate task objective-producing executable programs. CogniSQL-R1-Zero achieves state-of-the-art execution accuracy on Text2SQL benchmark; BIRD bench, outperforming prior supervised and instruction-tuned baselines including SFT CodeS-7B, DeepSeek-Coder 236B, and Mistral 123B-despite being trained on a significantly smaller 7B backbone. This result underscores the scalability and efficiency of our RL-based approach when trained on just four NVIDIA A100 GPUs (40 GB VRAM each). To support further research in efficient and interpretable Text-to-SQL modeling, we release two curated datasets: (i) a collection of 5,024 reasoning traces with varying context lengths, and (ii) a positive-sampled corpus of 36,356 corpus of weakly supervised queries, each annotated with six semantically diverse reasoning paths. Together, these contributions advance scalable, execution-aligned Text-to-SQL generation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we delve into the core of Co-MARL, namely Relation Patterns, which refer to agents' general understanding of interactions. In addition to generality, relation patterns exhibit task-specificity when mapped to different action spaces. To this end, we propose a novel method called General Relation Patterns-Guided Task-Specific Decision-Maker (RPG). In RPG, agents extract relation patterns from dynamic observation spaces using a relation capturer. These task-agnostic relation patterns are then mapped to different action spaces via a task-specific decision-maker generated by a conditional hypernetwork. To combat forgetting, we further introduce regularization items on both the relation capturer and the conditional hypernetwork. Results on SMAC and LBF demonstrate that RPG effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks and achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 Accepted |
| **[Data-Driven Mean Field Equilibrium Computation in Large-Population LQG Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19993v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel data-driven approach for approximating the $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in continuous-time linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) games, where multiple agents interact with each other through their dynamics and infinite horizon discounted costs. The core of our method involves solving two algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) and an ordinary differential equation (ODE) using state and input samples collected from agents, eliminating the need for a priori knowledge of their dynamical models. The standard ARE is addressed through an integral reinforcement learning (IRL) technique, while the nonsymmetric ARE and the ODE are resolved by identifying the drift coefficients of the agents' dynamics under general conditions. Moreover, by imposing specific conditions on models, we extend the IRL-based approach to approximately solve the nonsymmetric ARE. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning: Federated Learning and Cooperative and Noncooperative Decentralized Regimes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06278v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing interest in research and innovation towards the development of autonomous agents presents a number of complex yet important scenarios of multiple AI Agents interacting with each other in an environment. The particular setting can be understood as exhibiting three possibly topologies of interaction - centrally coordinated cooperation, ad-hoc interaction and cooperation, and settings with noncooperative incentive structures. This article presents a comprehensive survey of all three domains, defined under the formalism of Federal Reinforcement Learning (RL), Decentralized RL, and Noncooperative RL, respectively. Highlighting the structural similarities and distinctions, we review the state of the art in these subjects, primarily explored and developed only recently in the literature. We include the formulations as well as known theoretical guarantees and highlights and limitations of numerical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[VolleyBots: A Testbed for Multi-Drone Volleyball Game Combining Motion Control and Strategic Play](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01932v4)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot sports, characterized by well-defined objectives, explicit rules, and dynamic interactions, present ideal scenarios for demonstrating embodied intelligence. In this paper, we present VolleyBots, a novel robot sports testbed where multiple drones cooperate and compete in the sport of volleyball under physical dynamics. VolleyBots integrates three features within a unified platform: competitive and cooperative gameplay, turn-based interaction structure, and agile 3D maneuvering. Competitive and cooperative gameplay challenges each drone to coordinate with its teammates while anticipating and countering opposing teams' tactics. Turn-based interaction demands precise timing, accurate state prediction, and management of long-horizon temporal dependencies. Agile 3D maneuvering requires rapid accelerations, sharp turns, and precise 3D positioning despite the quadrotor's underactuated dynamics. These intertwined features yield a complex problem combining motion control and strategic play, with no available expert demonstrations. We provide a comprehensive suite of tasks ranging from single-drone drills to multi-drone cooperative and competitive tasks, accompanied by baseline evaluations of representative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game-theoretic algorithms. Simulation results show that on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods outperform off-policy methods in single-agent tasks, but both approaches struggle in complex tasks that combine motion control and strategic play. We additionally design a hierarchical policy which achieves a 69.5% percent win rate against the strongest baseline in the 3 vs 3 task, underscoring its potential as an effective solution for tackling the complex interplay between low-level control and high-level strategy.

| **[Mastering Multi-Drone Volleyball through Hierarchical Co-Self-Play Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04317v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning to play 3v3 multi-drone volleyball, a new embodied competitive task that requires both high-level strategic coordination and low-level agile control. The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9% win rate and a 71.5% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency. All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B. We hope our work contributes to the advancement of high-performance, on-device MLLMs and provides meaningful insights to the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Resolution Visual Reasoning via Multi-Turn Grounding-Based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05920v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art large multi-modal models (LMMs) face challenges when processing high-resolution images, as these inputs are converted into enormous visual tokens, many of which are irrelevant to the downstream task. In this paper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to iteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images, based on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation framework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly additional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge robust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a binary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer. Additionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual grounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we design a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss computation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby promoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when trained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding annotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared to GRPO, leading to 5.4\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and 5.2\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench. Notably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench.

| **[Differentiable Reward Optimization for LLM based TTS system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05911v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO) method aimed at enhancing the performance of neural codec language models based text-to-speech (TTS) systems. In contrast to conventional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches applied to TTS, DiffRO directly compute the rewards based on neural codec tokens, rather than relying on synthesized audio. Furthermore, we employ the Gumbel-Softmax technique to render the reward function differentiable, thereby streamlining the RLHF training process. Additionally, we introduce a multi-task reward (MTR) model which can provide feedback from different perspectives and find that it can augment the system's capability to follow instructions effectively.Experimental results indicate that DiffRO significantly improves the pronunciation accuracy of the TTS system, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) WER results on the seed-tts-eval benchmark. Moreover, with the integration of the MTR model, we demonstrate the ability to control emotional and quality attributes in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trust-Region Twisted Policy Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06048v4)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) has driven many recent breakthroughs in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, scaling MCTS to parallel compute has proven challenging in practice which has motivated alternative planners like sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC). Many of these SMC methods adopt particle filters for smoothing through a reformulation of RL as a policy inference problem. Yet, persisting design choices of these particle filters often conflict with the aim of online planning in RL, which is to obtain a policy improvement at the start of planning. Drawing inspiration from MCTS, we tailor SMC planners specifically for RL by improving data generation within the planner through constrained action sampling and explicit terminal state handling, as well as improving policy and value target estimation. This leads to our Trust-Region Twisted SMC (TRT-SMC), which shows improved runtime and sample-efficiency over baseline MCTS and SMC methods in both discrete and continuous domains.</p></details> | Poster at ICML2025 |
| **[Stable Acoustic Relay Assignment with High Throughput via Lase Chaos-based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05900v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the problem of stable acoustic relay assignment in an underwater acoustic network. Unlike the objectives of most existing literature, two distinct objectives, namely classical stable arrangement and ambiguous stable arrangement, are considered. To achieve these stable arrangements, a laser chaos-based multi-processing learning (LC-ML) method is introduced to efficiently obtain high throughput and rapidly attain stability. In order to sufficiently explore the relay's decision-making, this method uses random numbers generated by laser chaos to learn the assignment of relays to multiple source nodes. This study finds that the laser chaos-based random number and multi-processing in the exchange process have a positive effect on higher throughput and strong adaptability with environmental changing over time. Meanwhile, ambiguous cognitions result in the stable configuration with less volatility compared to accurate ones. This provides a practical and useful method and can be the basis for relay selection in complex underwater environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[OLAF: Programmable Data Plane Acceleration for Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05876v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can suffer from degraded convergence when model updates become stale, often the result of network congestion and packet loss during large-scale training. This work introduces a network data-plane acceleration architecture that mitigates such staleness by enabling inline processing of DRL model updates as they traverse the accelerator engine. To this end, we design and prototype a novel queueing mechanism that opportunistically combines compatible updates sharing a network element, reducing redundant traffic and preserving update utility. Complementing this we provide a lightweight transmission control mechanism at the worker nodes that is guided by feedback from the in-network accelerator. To assess model utility at line rate, we introduce the Age-of-Model (AoM) metric as a proxy for staleness and verify global fairness and responsiveness properties using a formal verification method. Our evaluations demonstrate that this architecture significantly reduces update staleness and congestion, ultimately improving the convergence rate in asynchronous DRL workloads.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

However, this remarkable precision often fails to translate into efficient manipulation of thin deformable objects. Current robotic systems lack imprecise dexterity, the ability to perform dexterous manipulation through robust and adaptive behaviors that do not rely on precise control. This paper explores the singulation and grasping of thin, deformable objects. Here, we propose a novel solution that incorporates passive compliance, touch, and proprioception into thin, deformable object manipulation. Our system employs a soft, underactuated hand that provides passive compliance, facilitating adaptive and gentle interactions to dexterously manipulate deformable objects without requiring precise control. The tactile and force/torque sensors equipped on the hand, along with a depth camera, gather sensory data required for manipulation via the proposed slip module. The manipulation policies are learned directly from raw sensory data via model-free reinforcement learning, bypassing explicit environmental and object modeling. We implement a hierarchical double-loop learning process to enhance learning efficiency by decoupling the action space. Our method was deployed on real-world robots and trained in a self-supervised manner. The resulting policy was tested on a variety of challenging tasks that were beyond the capabilities of prior studies, ranging from displaying suit fabric like a salesperson to turning pages of sheet music for violinists.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by T-RO, 20 pages</p></details> |
| **[Fine-tuning Diffusion Policies with Backpropagation Through Diffusion Timesteps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10482v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> |

While autonomous driving technologies and reinforcement learning (RL) have shown promise for improving traffic control, most prior work has focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections. Large-scale mixed traffic control, involving both human-driven and robotic vehicles, remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for managing large-scale mixed traffic networks, where intersections are controlled either by traditional traffic signals or by robotic vehicles. We evaluate our approach on a real-world network of 14 intersections in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA, using average vehicle waiting time as the primary measure of traffic efficiency. We are exploring a problem that has not been sufficiently addressed: Is large-scale Multi-Agent Traffic Control (MTC) still feasible when facing time-varying Origin-Destination (OD) patterns?</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Robust Bandwidth Estimation for Real-Time Communication with Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05785v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate bandwidth estimation (BWE) is critical for real-time communication (RTC) systems. Traditional heuristic approaches offer limited adaptability under dynamic networks, while online reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from high exploration costs and potential service disruptions. Offline RL, which leverages high-quality data collected from real-world environments, offers a promising alternative. However, challenges such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, policy extraction from behaviorally diverse datasets, and reliable deployment in production systems remain unsolved. We propose RBWE, a robust bandwidth estimation framework based on offline RL that integrates Q-ensemble (an ensemble of Q-functions) with a Gaussian mixture policy to mitigate OOD risks and enhance policy learning. A fallback mechanism ensures deployment stability by switching to heuristic methods under high uncertainty. Experimental results show that RBWE reduces overestimation errors by 18% and improves the 10th percentile Quality of Experience (QoE) by 18.6%, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world RTC applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies are insufficient in coordinating heterogeneous computing resources and adapting to dynamic network conditions. Hence, this paper proposes a dual-layer UAV-assisted edge computing architecture based on partial offloading, composed of the relay capability of high-altitude UAVs and the computing support of low-altitude UAVs. The proposed architecture enables efficient integration and coordination of heterogeneous resources. A joint optimization problem is formulated to minimize the system delay and energy consumption while ensuring the task completion rate. To solve the high-dimensional decision problem, we reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a hierarchical offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm. The method decouples global and local decisions, where the global decisions integrate offloading ratios and trajectory planning into continuous actions, while the local scheduling is handled via designing a priority-based mechanism. Simulations are conducted and demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and convergence speed, showing strong robustness and applicability in dynamic vehicular environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

These agents interpret raw GUI screenshots and autonomously decide where to click, scroll, or type, which bypasses handcrafted rules and app-specific APIs. However, most existing methods trained GUI agent in the offline environment using pre-collected trajectories. This approach limits scalability, causes overfitting to specific UI templates, and leads to brittle policies when faced with unseen environment. We present MobileGUI-RL, a scalable framework that trains GUI agent in online environment. MobileGUI-RL contains two key components. It (i) synthesizes a curriculum of learnable tasks through self-exploration and filtering, and (ii) adapts GRPO to GUI navigation with trajectory-aware advantages and composite rewards that balance task success and execution efficiency. Experiments on three online mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent gains, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |

Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models' search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoTriton: Automatic Triton Programming with Reinforcement Learning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05687v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kernel development in deep learning requires optimizing computational units across hardware while balancing memory management, parallelism, and hardware-specific optimizations through extensive empirical tuning. Although domain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting low-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such as tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation, creating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In this work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming expertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based reward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming ability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of TritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves performance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial role of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage, and the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for automatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance kernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an important foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code will be available at https://github.com/AI9Stars/AutoTriton.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging generative models, particularly diffusion models, these approaches offer notable advantages such as strong multi-task generalization, effective language conditioning, and high sample efficiency. While their application has been successful in manipulation tasks, their use in legged locomotion remains relatively underexplored, mainly due to compounding errors that affect stability and difficulties in task transition under limited data. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results in legged robot control in the past years, providing valuable insights to address these challenges. In this work, we propose DMLoco, a diffusion-based framework for quadruped robots that integrates multi-task pretraining with online PPO finetuning to enable language-conditioned control and robust task transitions. Our approach first pretrains the policy on a diverse multi-task dataset using diffusion models, enabling language-guided execution of various skills. Then, it finetunes the policy in simulation to ensure robustness and stable task transition during real-world deployment. By utilizing Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for efficient sampling and TensorRT for optimized deployment, our policy runs onboard at 50Hz, offering a scalable and efficient solution for adaptive, language-guided locomotion on resource-constrained robotic platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational OOD State Correction for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00503v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Offline reinforcement learning is significantly impacted by the issue of state distributional shift, and out-of-distribution (OOD) state correction is a popular approach to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Density-Aware Safety Perception (DASP) for OOD state correction. Specifically, our method encourages the agent to prioritize actions that lead to outcomes with higher data density, thereby promoting its operation within or the return to in-distribution (safe) regions. To achieve this, we optimize the objective within a variational framework that concurrently considers both the potential outcomes of decision-making and their density, thus providing crucial contextual information for safe decision-making. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed method through extensive experimental evaluations on the offline MuJoCo and AntMaze suites.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting and Mitigating Reward Hacking in Reinforcement Learning Systems: A Comprehensive Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05619v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward hacking in Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems poses a critical threat to the deployment of autonomous agents, where agents exploit flaws in reward functions to achieve high scores without fulfilling intended objectives. Despite growing awareness of this problem, systematic detection and mitigation approaches remain limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of reward hacking across diverse RL environments and algorithms. We analyze 15,247 training episodes across 15 RL environments (Atari, MuJoCo, custom domains) and 5 algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN, A3C, Rainbow), implementing automated detection algorithms for six categories of reward hacking: specification gaming, reward tampering, proxy optimization, objective misalignment, exploitation patterns, and wireheading. Our detection framework achieves 78.4% precision and 81.7% recall across environments, with computational overhead under 5%. Through controlled experiments varying reward function properties, we demonstrate that reward density and alignment with true objectives significantly impact hacking frequency ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 1.24$). We validate our approach through three simulated application studies representing recommendation systems, competitive gaming, and robotic control scenarios. Our mitigation techniques reduce hacking frequency by up to 54.6% in controlled scenarios, though we find these trade-offs are more challenging in practice due to concept drift, false positive costs, and adversarial adaptation. All detection algorithms, datasets, and experimental protocols are publicly available to support reproducible research in RL safety.</p></details> |  |

A challenge, however, is the effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser, holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance. Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.</p></details> | 19 Pages, 7 Figures |

We introduce Selective Prompting with Efficient Estimation of Difficulty (SPEED), an adaptive online RL curriculum that selectively chooses training examples of intermediate difficulty to maximize learning efficiency. Theoretically, we establish that intermediate-difficulty prompts improve the gradient estimator's signal-to-noise ratio, accelerating convergence. Empirically, our efficient implementation leads to 2x to 6x faster training without degrading accuracy, requires no manual tuning, and integrates seamlessly into standard RL algorithms.</p></details> | pre-print |
| **[Epistemically-guided forward-backward exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05477v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot reinforcement learning is necessary for extracting optimal policies in absence of concrete rewards for fast adaptation to future problem settings. Forward-backward representations (FB) have emerged as a promising method for learning optimal policies in absence of rewards via a factorization of the policy occupancy measure. However, up until now, FB and many similar zero-shot reinforcement learning algorithms have been decoupled from the exploration problem, generally relying on other exploration algorithms for data collection. We argue that FB representations should fundamentally be used for exploration in order to learn more efficiently. With this goal in mind, we design exploration policies that arise naturally from the FB representation that minimize the posterior variance of the FB representation, hence minimizing its epistemic uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that such principled exploration strategies improve sample complexity of the FB algorithm considerably in comparison to other exploration methods.

We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) integrated with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning framework for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach dynamically learns link priorities based on real-time traffic demand, network topology, remaining transmission opportunities, and interference patterns. The GCN captures spatial dependencies, while the DQN enables adaptive scheduling decisions through reward-guided exploration. Simulation results show that our GCN-DQN model achieves mean SINR improvements of 179.6\%, 197.4\%, and 175.2\% over LDP across three network configurations. Additionally, the GCN-DQN model demonstrates mean SINR improvements of 31.5\%, 53.0\%, and 84.7\% over our previous CNN-based approach across the same configurations.

The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes this challenge: although frequent small score changes yield immediate feedback, they often mislead agents into locally optimal but globally suboptimal strategies. In this work, we introduce a unified, distributional multi-step RL framework designed to directly optimize long-horizon performance. Using the open source Gym-2048 environment we develop and compare four agent variants: standard DQN, PPO, QR-DQN (Quantile Regression DQN), and a novel Horizon-DQN (H-DQN) that integrates distributional learning, dueling architectures, noisy networks, prioritized replay, and more. Empirical evaluation reveals a clear hierarchy in effectiveness: max episode scores improve from 3.988K (DQN) to 5.756K (PPO), 8.66K (QR-DQN), and 18.21K (H-DQN), with H-DQN reaching the 2048 tile. Upon scaling H-DQN it reaches a max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile. These results demonstrate that distributional, multi-step targets substantially enhance performance in sparse-reward domains, and they suggest promising avenues for further gains through model-based planning and curriculum learning.</p></details> |  |

Can similar ideas improve reinforcement learning (RL)? We answer affirmatively by observing that incorporating action sequences when predicting ground-truth return-to-go leads to lower validation loss. Motivated by this, we introduce Coarse-to-fine Q-Network with Action Sequence (CQN-AS), a novel value-based RL algorithm that learns a critic network that outputs Q-values over a sequence of actions, i.e., explicitly training the value function to learn the consequence of executing action sequences. Our experiments show that CQN-AS outperforms several baselines on a variety of sparse-reward humanoid control and tabletop manipulation tasks from BiGym and RLBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages.

Especially for low-resource languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. Current multilingual benchmarks focus only on final answers, overlooking whether models actually reason in the target language. To address this gap, we introduce GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark with annotated reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese, Swahili, and Thai. We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that guides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a language-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language. Finally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to assess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning traces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics. Our results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning fidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization. https://jd730.github.io/projects/GeoFact-X_BRIDGE</p></details> |  |
| **[Open Vision Reasoner: Transferring Linguistic Cognitive Behavior for Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05255v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning, followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps, surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR), achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks, including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Action Space Reduction Strategies for Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05251v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous driving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with environments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving: dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous driving tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Going Beyond Heuristics by Imposing Policy Improvement as a Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05328v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, augmenting the task rewards with heuristic rewards that encode human priors about how a task should be solved is crucial for achieving desirable performance. However, because such heuristics are usually not optimal, much human effort and computational resources are wasted in carefully balancing tasks and heuristic rewards. Theoretically rigorous ways of incorporating heuristics rely on the idea of \textit{policy invariance}, which guarantees that the performance of a policy obtained by maximizing heuristic rewards is the same as the optimal policy with respect to the task reward. However, in practice, policy invariance doesn't result in policy improvement, and such methods are known to empirically perform poorly. We propose a new paradigm to mitigate reward hacking and effectively use heuristics based on the practical goal of maximizing policy improvement instead of policy improvement. Our framework, Heuristic Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO), effectively leverages heuristics while avoiding the pitfall of prior methods for mitigating reward hacking. HEPO achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks with well-engineered reward functions. More surprisingly, HEPO allows policy optimization to achieve good performance even when heuristics are not well-engineered and designed by non-expert humans, showcasing HEPO's ability to reduce human effort in reward design. % HEPO is a plug-and-play optimization method for leveraging heuristics in reinforcement learning.

| **[Extended Inductive Reasoning for Personalized Preference Inference from Behavioral Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18071v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in complex reasoning tasks such as math and coding. In contrast to these tasks where deductive reasoning predominates, inductive reasoning-the ability to derive general rules from incomplete evidence, remains underexplored. This paper investigates extended inductive reasoning in LLMs through the lens of personalized preference inference, a critical challenge in LLM alignment where current approaches struggle to capture diverse user preferences. The task demands strong inductive reasoning capabilities as user preferences are typically embedded implicitly across various interaction forms, requiring models to synthesize consistent preference patterns from scattered signals. We propose AlignXplore, a model that leverages extended reasoning chains to enable systematic preference inference from behavioral signals in users' interaction histories. Such explicit preference articulation enables efficient streaming inference: when new behavioral signals emerge, the model can directly build upon previously inferred preference descriptions rather than reprocessing historical signals from scratch, while also supporting iterative refinement to the inferred preferences. We develop AlignXplore by combining cold-start training based on synthetic data with subsequent online reinforcement learning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AlignXplore achieves substantial improvements over the backbone model by an average of 15.49\% on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability across different input formats and downstream models. Further analyses establish best practices for preference inference learning through systematic comparison of reward modeling strategies, while revealing the emergence of human-like inductive reasoning patterns during training.</p></details> |  |

We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |

Current methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often prioritize helpfulness and safety but fall short in fostering truly empathetic, adaptive, and personalized dialogues. Existing personalization approaches typically rely on extensive user history, limiting their effectiveness for new or context-limited users. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging a user model to incorporate a curiosity-based intrinsic reward into multi-turn RLHF. This novel reward mechanism encourages the LLM agent to actively infer user traits by optimizing conversations to improve its user model's accuracy. Consequently, the agent delivers more personalized interactions by learning more about the user. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two distinct domains: significantly improving personalization performance in a conversational recommendation task, and personalizing conversations for different learning styles in an educational setting. We show improved generalization capabilities compared to traditional multi-turn RLHF, all while maintaining conversation quality. Our method offers a promising solution for creating more personalized, adaptive, and engaging conversational agents.</p></details> |  |

However, collecting such embodied data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner, a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap. It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74% compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by 89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning.

In that line of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during inference in the form of "thoughts" expressed in natural language. In this paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend additional compute on the task.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, includes appendix</p></details> |

However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoramic images, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 48 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing SOTA TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |

However, adversarial attacks, such as sensor manipulation, and communication jamming, pose significant challenges to the performance of traditional localization methods. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed fault-tolerant cooperative localization framework to enhance resilience against sensor and communication disruptions in adversarial environments. We introduce an adaptive event-triggered communication strategy that dynamically adjusts communication thresholds based on real-time sensing and communication quality. This strategy ensures optimal performance even in the presence of sensor degradation or communication failure. Furthermore, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the convergence and stability properties of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its resilience against bounded adversarial zones and maintaining accurate state estimation. Robotarium-based experiment results show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of localization accuracy and communication efficiency, particularly in adversarial settings. Our approach offers improved scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance for MRS, making it suitable for large-scale deployments in real-world, challenging environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025 Conference</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce Quality Diversity Inverse Reinforcement Learning (QD-IRL), a novel framework that integrates quality-diversity optimization with IRL methods, enabling agents to learn diverse behaviors from limited demonstrations. This work introduces Extrinsic Behavioral Curiosity (EBC), which allows agents to receive additional curiosity rewards from an external critic based on how novel the behaviors are with respect to a large behavioral archive. To validate the effectiveness of EBC in exploring diverse locomotion behaviors, we evaluate our method on multiple robot locomotion tasks. EBC improves the performance of QD-IRL instances with GAIL, VAIL, and DiffAIL across all included environments by up to 185%, 42%, and 150%, even surpassing expert performance by 20% in Humanoid. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EBC is applicable to Gradient-Arborescence-based Quality Diversity Reinforcement Learning (QD-RL) algorithms, where it substantially improves performance and provides a generic technique for diverse robot locomotion.

Traditional safety models primarily rely on sensor-based measures, such as relative distance and velocity, to assess physical safety. However, these models often fail to capture subjective safety perceptions, which are shaped by individual traits and contextual factors. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a parameterized general safety model that bridges the gap between physical and perceived safety by incorporating a personalization parameter, $\rho$, into the safety measurement framework to account for individual differences in safety perception. Through a series of hypothesis-driven human-subject studies in a simulated rescue scenario, we investigate how emotional state, trust, and robot behavior influence perceived safety. Our results show that $\rho$ effectively captures meaningful individual differences, driven by affective responses, trust in task consistency, and clustering into distinct user types. Specifically, our findings confirm that predictable and consistent robot behavior as well as the elicitation of positive emotional states, significantly enhance perceived safety. Moreover, responses cluster into a small number of user types, supporting adaptive personalization based on shared safety models. Notably, participant role significantly shapes safety perception, and repeated exposure reduces perceived safety for participants in the casualty role, emphasizing the impact of physical interaction and experiential change. These findings highlight the importance of adaptive, human-centered safety models that integrate both psychological and behavioral dimensions, offering a pathway toward more trustworthy and effective HRI in safety-critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE RO-MAN 2025 Conference</p></details> |

However, accurately perceiving human actions and achieving adaptive control remains a challenge in facilitating seamless coordination between human and robotic movements. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical procedural framework to enable dynamic robot-assisted hand-object interaction (HOI). An open-loop hierarchy leverages the RGB-based 3D reconstruction of the human hand, based on which motion primitives have been designed to translate hand motions into robotic actions. The low-level coordination hierarchy fine-tunes the robot's action by using the continuously updated 3D hand models. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the hierarchical control architecture. The adaptive coordination between human and robot behavior has achieved a delay of $\leq 0.3$ seconds in the tele-interaction scenario. A case study of ring-wearing tasks indicates the potential application of this work in assistive technologies such as healthcare and manufacturing.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

The proposed array achieves reconfigurability through continuous deformation of its geometry, in contrast to reconfigurable antennas which incur a per-element control. More specifically, the deformation is modeled by amplitude and spatial frequency parameters. We consider a multi-user multiple-input single-output downlink system, whereby the optimal deformation parameters are found to maximize the sum rate in the network. A successive convex approximation method is adopted to solve the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed deformable array significantly outperforms fixed geometry and per-element reconfigurable arrays in sum rate, demonstrating the benefits of structure-level flexibility for next-generation antenna arrays.</p></details> |  |

However, their nonlinear and hysteretic behavior, resulting from the properties of soft materials, presents substantial challenges for accurate modeling and control. In this study, we present a soft robotic system designed for surgical applications and propose a hysteresis-aware whole-body neural network model that accurately captures and predicts the soft robot's whole-body motion, including its hysteretic behavior. Building upon the high-precision dynamic model, we construct a highly parallel simulation environment for soft robot control and apply an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm to efficiently train whole-body motion control strategies. Based on the trained control policy, we developed a soft robotic system for surgical applications and validated it through phantom-based laser ablation experiments in a physical environment. The results demonstrate that the hysteresis-aware modeling reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 84.95 percent compared to traditional modeling methods. The deployed control algorithm achieved a trajectory tracking error ranging from 0.126 to 0.250 mm on the real soft robot, highlighting its precision in real-world conditions.

As a result, expectations are rising for the automation of tasks such as material transport and exploration in unknown environments. However, autonomous locomotion in rough terrains with significant height variations requires vertical movement, and robots capable of performing such movements stably, along with their control methods, have not yet been fully established. In this study, we developed the quadruped robot KLEIYN, which features a waist joint, and aimed to expand quadruped locomotion by enabling chimney climbing through RL. To facilitate the learning of vertical motion, we introduced Contact-Guided Curriculum Learning (CGCL). As a result, KLEIYN successfully climbed walls ranging from 800 mm to 1000 mm in width at an average speed of 150 mm/s, 50 times faster than conventional robots. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the introduction of a waist joint improves climbing performance, particularly enhancing tracking ability on narrow walls.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS2025, website - https://keitayoneda.github.io/kleiyn-chimney-climbing/, YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDmSfkazAvI</p></details> |

The typical approach is useful to compare learning algorithms but provides limited insight into the effects of different training regimens and little understanding about the richness and complexity of learned behaviors. Likewise, human infants and other animals are "trained" via unsystematic regimens, but in contrast, developmental psychologists evaluate their performance in highly-controlled experiments with fine-grained measures such as success, speed of walking, and prospective adjustments. However, the study of learned behavior in human infants is limited by the practical constraints of training and testing babies. Here, we present a case study that applies methods from developmental psychology to study the learned behavior of the simulated bipedal robot Cassie. Following research on infant walking, we systematically designed reinforcement learning training regimens and tested the resulting controllers in simulated environments analogous to those used for babies--but without the practical constraints. Results reveal new insights into the behavioral impact of different training regimens and the development of Cassie's learned behaviors relative to infants who are learning to walk. This interdisciplinary baby-robot approach provides inspiration for future research designed to systematically test effects of training on the development of complex learned robot behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted into ICDL 2025 as a contributed paper</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose a general evaluation framework that measures the quality of Imitation Learning (IL) methods by focusing on trajectory performance. We devise the Neural Meta Evaluator (NeME), a deep learning model trained to classify actions from robot joint trajectories. NeME serves as a meta-evaluator to compare the performance of robot control policies, enabling policy evaluation without requiring human involvement in the loop. We validate our framework on ergoCub, a humanoid robot, using teleoperation data and comparing IL methods tailored to the available platform. The experimental results indicate that our method is more aligned with the success rate obtained on the robot than baselines, offering a reproducible, systematic, and insightful means for comparing the performance of multimodal imitation learning approaches in complex HRI tasks.</p></details> |  |

The system is designed to enhance common strategies in the forex market using fuzzy logic, thereby improving the accuracy of transactions. Traditionally, technical strategies based on oscillator indicators have relied on predefined ranges for indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Commodity Channel Indicator (CCI), and Stochastic to determine entry points for trades. However, the use of these classic indicators has yielded suboptimal results due to the changing nature of the market over time. In our proposed approach, instead of employing classical indicators, we introduce a fuzzy Mamdani system for each indicator. The results obtained from these systems are then combined through voting to design a trading robot. Our findings demonstrate a considerable increase in the profitability factor compared to three other methods. Additionally, net profit, gross profit, and maximum capital reduction are calculated and compared across all approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, enabling humanoids to reason, plan, and act in complex open-world settings remains a challenge. World models, models that predict the future outcome of a given action, can support these capabilities by serving as a dynamics model in long-horizon planning and generating synthetic data for policy learning. We introduce Humanoid World Models (HWM), a family of lightweight, open-source models that forecast future egocentric video conditioned on humanoid control tokens. We train two types of generative models, Masked Transformers and Flow-Matching, on 100 hours of humanoid demonstrations. Additionally, we explore architectural variants with different attention mechanisms and parameter-sharing strategies. Our parameter-sharing techniques reduce model size by 33-53% with minimal impact on performance or visual fidelity. HWMs are designed to be trained and deployed in practical academic and small-lab settings, such as 1-2 GPUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[EC-Flow: Enabling Versatile Robotic Manipulation from Action-Unlabeled Videos via Embodiment-Centric Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06224v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current language-guided robotic manipulation systems often require low-level action-labeled datasets for imitation learning. While object-centric flow prediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios involving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this work, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly learns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting embodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's inherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile manipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and non-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language instructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment module by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction. Moreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a standard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify kinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We validate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62% improvement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and non-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art object-centric flow methods.

| **[Is Diversity All You Need for Scalable Robotic Manipulation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06219v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data scaling has driven remarkable success in foundation models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), yet the principles of effective data scaling in robotic manipulation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do), embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2) multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity, arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation datasets effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/AgiBot-World</p></details> |

A tethered tensile perching mechanism offers a simple, adaptable solution that can be retrofitted to existing robots and accommodates a variety of structure sizes and shapes. However, tethered tensile perching introduces significant modelling challenges which require precise management of aerial robot dynamics, including the cases of tether slack & tension, and momentum transfer. Achieving smooth wrapping and secure anchoring by targeting a specific tether segment adds further complexity. In this work, we present a novel trajectory framework for tethered tensile perching, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) through the Soft Actor-Critic from Demonstrations (SACfD) algorithm. By incorporating both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations, our approach enhances training efficiency and responsiveness, achieving precise control over position and velocity. This framework enables the aerial robot to accurately target specific tether segments, facilitating reliable wrapping and secure anchoring. We validate our framework through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, and demonstrate effectiveness in achieving agile and reliable trajectory generation for tensile perching.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Effective performance in this domain requires coordinating a multi-robot inspection team to prioritize inspecting locations more likely to need immediate response, while also minimizing travel time. This is particularly challenging because robots must directly observe the locations to determine which ones require additional attention. This work introduces a multi-robot planning framework for coordinated time-critical multi-robot search under uncertainty. Our approach uses a graph neural network to estimate the likelihood of PoIs needing attention from noisy sensor data and then uses those predictions to guide a multi-robot model-based planner to determine the cost-effective plan. Simulated experiments demonstrate that our planner improves performance at least by 16.3\%, 26.7\%, and 26.2\% for 1, 3, and 5 robots, respectively, compared to non-learned and learned baselines. We also validate our approach on real-world platforms using quad-copters.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, CASE 2025</p></details> |

Three of the primary areas are studied and covered in this review: how AR can improve social and learning results, how LLMs can support communication, and how UI/UX design affects how effective these technologies can be. Results show that while LLMs can provide individualized learning and communication support, AR has shown promise in enhancing social skills, motivation, and attention. For children with ASD, accessible and engaging interventions rely heavily on effective UI/UX design, but there is still a significant lack of robotics-based education and therapeutic programs specifically tailored for autistic children. To optimize the benefits of these technologies in ASD therapies and immersive education, the study emphasizes the need for additional research to address difficulties related to customization, accessibility, and integration.</p></details> | none |
| **[SCCRUB: Surface Cleaning Compliant Robot Utilizing Bristles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06053v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scrubbing surfaces is a physically demanding and time-intensive task. Removing adhered contamination requires substantial friction generated through pressure and torque or high lateral forces. Rigid robotic manipulators, while capable of exerting these forces, are usually confined to structured environments isolated from humans due to safety risks. In contrast, soft robot arms can safely work around humans and adapt to environmental uncertainty, but typically struggle to transmit the continuous torques or lateral forces necessary for scrubbing. Here, we demonstrate a soft robotic arm scrubbing adhered residues using torque and pressure, a task traditionally challenging for soft robots. We train a neural network to learn the arm's inverse kinematics and elasticity, which enables open-loop force and position control. Using this learned model, the robot successfully scrubbed burnt food residue from a plate and sticky fruit preserve from a toilet seat, removing an average of 99.7% of contamination. This work demonstrates how soft robots, capable of exerting continuous torque, can effectively and safely scrub challenging contamination from surfaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[AURA-CVC: Autonomous Ultrasound-guided Robotic Assistance for Central Venous Catheterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05979v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Central venous catheterization (CVC) is a critical medical procedure for vascular access, hemodynamic monitoring, and life-saving interventions. Its success remains challenging due to the need for continuous ultrasound-guided visualization of a target vessel and approaching needle, which is further complicated by anatomical variability and operator dependency. Errors in needle placement can lead to life-threatening complications. While robotic systems offer a potential solution, achieving full autonomy remains challenging. In this work, we propose an end-to-end robotic-ultrasound-guided CVC pipeline, from scan initialization to needle insertion. Methods: We introduce a deep-learning model to identify clinically relevant anatomical landmarks from a depth image of the patient's neck, obtained using RGB-D camera, to autonomously define the scanning region and paths. Then, a robot motion planning framework is proposed to scan, segment, reconstruct, and localize vessels (veins and arteries), followed by the identification of the optimal insertion zone. Finally, a needle guidance module plans the insertion under ultrasound guidance with operator's feedback. This pipeline was validated on a high-fidelity commercial phantom across 10 simulated clinical scenarios. Results: The proposed pipeline achieved 10 out of 10 successful needle placements on the first attempt. Vessels were reconstructed with a mean error of 2.15 \textit{mm}, and autonomous needle insertion was performed with an error less than or close to 1 \textit{mm}. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first robotic CVC system demonstrated on a high-fidelity phantom with integrated planning, scanning, and insertion. Experimental results show its potential for clinical translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting and Diagnosing Faults in Autonomous Robot Swarms with an Artificial Antibody Population Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19942v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An active approach to fault tolerance, the combined processes of fault detection, diagnosis, and recovery, is essential for long term autonomy in robots -- particularly multi-robot systems and swarms. Previous efforts have primarily focussed on spontaneously occurring electro-mechanical failures in the sensors and actuators of a minority sub-population of robots. While the systems that enable this function are valuable, they have not yet considered that many failures arise from gradual wear and tear with continued operation, and that this may be more challenging to detect than sudden step changes in performance. This paper presents the Artificial Antibody Population Dynamics (AAPD) model -- an immune-inspired model for the detection and diagnosis of gradual degradation in robot swarms. The AAPD model is demonstrated to reliably detect and diagnose gradual degradation, as well as spontaneous changes in performance, among swarms of robots of varying sizes while remaining tolerant of normally behaving robots. The AAPD model is distributed, offers supervised and unsupervised configurations, and demonstrates promising scalable properties. Deploying the AAPD model on a swarm of foraging robots undergoing gradual degradation enables the swarm to operate on average at between 70% - 97% of its performance in perfect conditions and is able to prevent instances of robots failing in the field during experiments in most of the cases tested.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes a holistic framework for construction task specification, optimization of robot morphology, and mission execution using a mobile modular reconfigurable robot. Users can specify and monitor the desired robot behavior through a graphical interface. In contrast to existing, monolithic solutions, we automatically identify a new task-tailored robot for every task by integrating \acf{bim}. Our framework leverages modular robot components that enable the fast adaption of robot hardware to the specific demands of the construction task. Other than previous works on modular robot optimization, we consider multiple competing objectives, which allow us to explicitly model the challenges of real-world transfer, such as calibration errors. We demonstrate our framework in simulation by optimizing robots for drilling and spray painting. Finally, experimental validation demonstrates that our approach robustly enables the autonomous execution of robotic drilling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036791</p></details> |

To achieve similar adaptability, robots must accurately estimate human trust at sufficiently granular timescales while collaborating with humans. Beta reputation is a popular way to formalize a mathematical estimation of human trust. However, it relies on binary performance, which updates trust estimations only after each task concludes. Additionally, manually crafting a reward function is the usual method of building a performance indicator, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. These limitations prevent efficient capture of continuous trust changes at more granular timescales throughout the collaboration task. Therefore, this paper presents a new framework for the estimation of human trust using beta reputation at fine-grained timescales. To achieve granularity in beta reputation, we utilize continuous reward values to update trust estimates at each timestep of a task. We construct a continuous reward function using maximum entropy optimization to eliminate the need for the laborious specification of a performance indicator. The proposed framework improves trust estimations by increasing accuracy, eliminating the need to manually craft a reward function, and advancing toward the development of more intelligent robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) 2025</p></details> |
| **[On the Robotic Uncertainty of Fully Autonomous Traffic: From Stochastic Car-Following to Mobility-Safety Trade-Offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12611v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent transportation research highlights the potential of autonomous vehicles (AV) to improve traffic flow mobility as they are able to maintain smaller car-following distances. However, as a unique class of ground robots, AVs are susceptible to robotic errors, particularly in their perception and control modules with imperfect sensors and actuators, leading to uncertainties in their movements and an increased risk of collisions. Consequently, conservative operational strategies, such as larger headway and slower speeds, are implemented to prioritize safety over mobility in real-world operations. To reconcile the inconsistency, this paper presents an analytical model framework that delineates the endogenous reciprocity between traffic safety and mobility that arises from AVs' robotic uncertainties. Using both realistic car-following data and a stochastic intelligent driving model (IDM), the stochastic car-following distance is derived as a key parameter, enabling analysis of single-lane capacity and collision probability. A semi-Markov process is then employed to model the dynamics of the lane capacity, and the resulting collision-inclusive capacity, representing expected lane capacity under stationary conditions, serves as the primary performance metric for fully autonomous traffic. The analytical results are further utilized to investigate the impacts of critical parameters in AV and roadway designs on traffic performance, as well as the properties of optimal speed and headway under mobility-targeted or safety-dominated management objectives. Extensions to scenarios involving multiple non-independent collisions or multi-lane traffic scenarios are also discussed, which demonstrates the robustness of the theoretical results and their practical applications.</p></details> |  |

In most of theoretical models, the shape variables, i.e. joint angles, are directly prescribed as periodic inputs, such as steering angle of the Twistcar. In this work, we study a variant of the Twistcar model where the actuation input is periodic oscillations of an inertial rotor attached to the main body, while the steering joint is passively free to rotate. Remarkably, the dynamics of this model is extremely rich, and includes multiplicity of periodic solutions, both symmetric and asymmetric, as well as stability transitions and bifurcations. We conduct numerical simulations as well as asymptotic analysis of the vehicle's reduced equations of motion. We use perturbation expansion in order to obtain leading-order dynamics under symmetric periodic solution. Then, we utilize harmonic balance and further scaling assumptions in order to approximate the conditions for symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation and stability transition of the symmetric periodic solution, as a function of actuation frequency and structural parameters. The asymptotic results show good agreement with numerical simulations. The results highlight the role of passive shape variables in generating multi-stable periodic solutions for nonholonomic systems of robotic locomotion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppo...</summary><p>Supporting Information is available at https://yizhar.net.technion.ac.il/files/2025/06/SI-MATLAB-file-Anna-Z.zip</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Diffusion Policies with Projective Geometric Algebra for Efficient Robot Manipulation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05695v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have become increasingly popular in robot learning due to their reliable convergence in motion generation tasks. At a high level, these policies learn to transform noisy action trajectories into effective ones, conditioned on observations. However, each time such a model is trained in a robotics context, the network must relearn fundamental spatial representations and operations, such as translations and rotations, from scratch in order to ground itself and operate effectively in a 3D environment. Incorporating geometric inductive biases directly into the network can alleviate this redundancy and substantially improve training efficiency. In this paper, we introduce hPGA-DP, a diffusion policy approach that integrates a mathematical framework called Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) to embed strong geometric inductive biases. PGA is particularly well-suited for this purpose as it provides a unified algebraic framework that naturally encodes geometric primitives, such as points, directions, and rotations, enabling neural networks to reason about spatial structure through interpretable and composable operations. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion policy architecture that incorporates the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr), leveraging its E(3)-equivariant properties established in prior work. Our approach adopts a hybrid architecture strategy, using P-GATr as both a state encoder and action decoder, while employing U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the denoising process. Several experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that hPGA-DP not only improves task performance and training efficiency through the geometric bias of P-GATr, but also achieves substantially faster convergence through its hybrid model compared to architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging generative models, particularly diffusion models, these approaches offer notable advantages such as strong multi-task generalization, effective language conditioning, and high sample efficiency. While their application has been successful in manipulation tasks, their use in legged locomotion remains relatively underexplored, mainly due to compounding errors that affect stability and difficulties in task transition under limited data. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results in legged robot control in the past years, providing valuable insights to address these challenges. In this work, we propose DMLoco, a diffusion-based framework for quadruped robots that integrates multi-task pretraining with online PPO finetuning to enable language-conditioned control and robust task transitions. Our approach first pretrains the policy on a diverse multi-task dataset using diffusion models, enabling language-guided execution of various skills. Then, it finetunes the policy in simulation to ensure robustness and stable task transition during real-world deployment. By utilizing Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for efficient sampling and TensorRT for optimized deployment, our policy runs onboard at 50Hz, offering a scalable and efficient solution for adaptive, language-guided locomotion on resource-constrained robotic platforms.</p></details> |  |

To improve data collection efficiency, some approaches focus on developing specialized teleoperation devices for robot control, while others directly use human hand demonstrations to obtain training data. However, the former requires both a robotic system and a skilled operator, limiting scalability, while the latter faces challenges in aligning the visual gap between human hand demonstrations and the deployed robot observations. To address this, we propose a human hand data collection system combined with our hand-to-gripper generative model, which translates human hand demonstrations into robot gripper demonstrations, effectively bridging the observation gap. Specifically, a GoPro fisheye camera is mounted on the human wrist to capture human hand demonstrations. We then train a generative model on a self-collected dataset of paired human hand and UMI gripper demonstrations, which have been processed using a tailored data pre-processing strategy to ensure alignment in both timestamps and observations. Therefore, given only human hand demonstrations, we are able to automatically extract the corresponding SE(3) actions and integrate them with high-quality generated robot demonstrations through our generation pipeline for training robotic policy model. In experiments, the robust manipulation performance demonstrates not only the quality of the generated robot demonstrations but also the efficiency and practicality of our data collection method.

To further enhance configurability, we introduce a pluggable puppeteer device that can be easily mounted and adapted to match the target robot configurations. PAPRLE supports bilateral teleoperation through these puppeteer devices, agnostic to the type or configuration of the follower robot. By supporting both joint-space and task-space control, the system provides real-time force feedback, improving user fidelity and physical interaction awareness. The modular design of PAPRLE facilitates novel spatial arrangements of the limbs and enables scalable data collection, thereby advancing research in embodied AI and learning-based control. We validate PAPRLE in various real-world settings, demonstrating its versatility across diverse combinations of leader devices and follower robots. The system will be released as open source, including both hardware and software components, to support broader adoption and community-driven extension.

With the advent of LLMs, language has been emerging as a prospective interface layer. However, this has several limitations. Not all tasks can be decomposed into steps that are easily expressible in natural language (e.g. performing a dance routine). Further, it makes end-to-end finetuning on embodied data challenging due to domain shift and catastrophic forgetting. We introduce our method -- Learnable Latent Codes as Bridges (LCB) -- as an alternate architecture to overcome these limitations. \method~uses a learnable latent code to act as a bridge between LLMs and low-level policies. This enables LLMs to flexibly communicate goals in the task plan without being entirely constrained by language limitations. Additionally, it enables end-to-end finetuning without destroying the embedding space of word tokens learned during pre-training. Through experiments on Language Table and Calvin, two common language based benchmarks for embodied agents, we find that \method~outperforms baselines (including those w/ GPT-4V) that leverage pure language as the interface layer on tasks that require reasoning and multi-step behaviors.</p></details> |  |

In this context, this study presents an occlusion-aware Consistent Model Predictive Control (CMPC) strategy. To account for the occluded obstacles, it incorporates adjustable risk regions that represent their potential future locations. Subsequently, dynamic risk boundary constraints are developed online to ensure safety. The CMPC then constructs multiple locally optimal trajectory branches (each tailored to different risk regions) to balance between exploitation and exploration. A shared consensus trunk is generated to ensure smooth transitions between branches without significant velocity fluctuations, further preserving motion consistency. To facilitate high computational efficiency and ensure coordination across local trajectories, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the CMPC into manageable sub-problems for parallel solving. The proposed strategy is validated through simulation and real-world experiments on an Ackermann-steering robot platform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CMPC strategy through comparisons with baseline approaches in occluded, obstacle-dense environments.</p></details> |  |

Verifying high-level task plans before execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan. Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems.

Accurately estimating an object's mass before interaction can significantly enhance the performance of various robotic tasks. However, mass estimation using only vision sensors is a relatively underexplored area. This paper proposes a novel approach combining sparse point-cloud data from depth images with RGB images to estimate the mass of objects. We evaluate a range of point-cloud processing architectures, alongside RGB-only methods. To overcome the limited availability of training data, we create a synthetic dataset using ShapeNetSem 3D models, simulating RGBD images via a Kinect camera. This synthetic data is used to train an image generation model for estimating dense depth maps, which we then use to augment an existing dataset of images paired with mass values. Our approach significantly outperforms existing benchmarks across all evaluated metrics. The data generation (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/ShapenetSem-to-RGBD) as well as the training of the depth estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/GLPDepth-Edited) and the mass estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/Depth-mass-estimator) are available online.</p></details> |  |

| **[Unifying Robot Optimization: Monte Carlo Tree Search with Tensor Factorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04949v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many robotic tasks, such as inverse kinematics, motion planning, and optimal control, can be formulated as optimization problems. Solving these problems involves addressing nonlinear kinematics, complex contact dynamics, and long-horizon planning, each posing distinct challenges for state-of-the-art optimization methods. To efficiently solve a wide range of tasks across varying scenarios, researchers either develop specialized algorithms for the task to achieve, or switch between different frameworks. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a general-purpose decision-making tool that enables strategic exploration across problem instances without relying on task-specific structures. However, MCTS suffers from combinatorial complexity, leading to slow convergence and high memory usage. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Tensor Train Tree Search} (TTTS), which leverages tensor factorization to exploit the separable structure of decision trees. This yields a low-rank, linear-complexity representation that significantly reduces both computation time and storage requirements. We prove that TTTS can efficiently reach the bounded global optimum within a finite time. Experimental results across inverse kinematics, motion planning around obstacles, multi-stage motion planning, and bimanual whole-body manipulation demonstrate the efficiency of TTTS on a diverse set of robotic tasks.</p></details> | 46 pages, 8 figures |

Rather than requiring access to internal robot systems, our approach mounts a smartphone equipped with a camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the robot, making it applicable to any commercial robot without hardware modifications. The system estimates robot poses through neural inertial navigation and efficiently captures images at regular spatial intervals throughout the cleaning task. We develop a novel test-time data augmentation method called Rotation-Augmented Ensemble (RAE) to mitigate domain gaps in neural inertial navigation. A loop closure method that exploits robot cleaning patterns further refines these estimated poses. We demonstrate the system with an object mapping application that analyzes captured images to geo-localize objects in the environment. Experimental evaluation in retail environments shows that our approach achieves 0.83 m relative pose error for robot localization and 0.97 m positional error for object mapping of over 100 items.</p></details> |  |

MOSU addresses the outdoor robot navigation challenge by integrating geometric, semantic, and contextual information to ensure comprehensive scene understanding. The system combines GPS and QGIS map-based routing for high-level global path planning and multi-modal trajectory generation for local navigation refinement. For trajectory generation, MOSU leverages multi-modalities: LiDAR-based geometric data for precise obstacle avoidance, image-based semantic segmentation for traversability assessment, and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to capture social context and enable the robot to adhere to social norms in complex environments. This multi-modal integration improves scene understanding and enhances traversability, allowing the robot to adapt to diverse outdoor conditions. We evaluate our system in real-world on-road environments and benchmark it on the GND dataset, achieving a 10% improvement in traversability on navigable terrains while maintaining a comparable navigation distance to existing global navigation methods.</p></details> |  |

We propose a new RL framework with ReflexNet for low-level task execution, SchemaPlanner for symbolic reasoning, and HyperOptima for long-term context modeling, ensuring continuous adaptation and memory retention. Experimental results show that DRAE significantly outperforms baseline approaches in long-term task retention and knowledge reuse, achieving an average task success rate of 82.5% across a set of dynamic robotic manipulation tasks, compared to 74.2% for traditional MoE models. Furthermore, DRAE maintains an extremely low forgetting rate, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in catastrophic forgetting mitigation. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling flexible, scalable, and efficient lifelong learning for robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025)</p></details> |

The key challenge lies in the significant uncertainty in drag and weight parameters introduced by the collected litter. We propose a dynamical model for the coupled UUV-USV system in the primary plane of motion and a risk-aware optimization approach incorporating parameter uncertainty and noise to ensure safe interactions with the environment. A stochastic optimization problem is solved using a conditional value-at-risk framework. Simulations demonstrate that our approach reduces collision risks and energy consumption, highlighting its reliability compared to existing control methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[IDAGC: Adaptive Generalized Human-Robot Collaboration via Human Intent Estimation and Multimodal Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04620v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), which encompasses physical interaction and remote cooperation, accurate estimation of human intentions and seamless switching of collaboration modes to adjust robot behavior remain paramount challenges. To address these issues, we propose an Intent-Driven Adaptive Generalized Collaboration (IDAGC) framework that leverages multimodal data and human intent estimation to facilitate adaptive policy learning across multi-tasks in diverse scenarios, thereby facilitating autonomous inference of collaboration modes and dynamic adjustment of robotic actions. This framework overcomes the limitations of existing HRC methods, which are typically restricted to a single collaboration mode and lack the capacity to identify and transition between diverse states. Central to our framework is a predictive model that captures the interdependencies among vision, language, force, and robot state data to accurately recognize human intentions with a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and automatically switch collaboration modes. By employing dedicated encoders for each modality and integrating extracted features through a Transformer decoder, the framework efficiently learns multi-task policies, while force data optimizes compliance control and intent estimation accuracy during physical interactions. Experiments highlights our framework's practical potential to advance the comprehensive development of HRC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[D4orm: Multi-Robot Trajectories with Dynamics-aware Diffusion Denoised Deformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12204v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents an optimization method for generating kinodynamically feasible and collision-free multi-robot trajectories that exploits an incremental denoising scheme in diffusion models. Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a fitness function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes a deformation for the previous trajectory with the current denoising process, allows anytime refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI. In a 2D holonomic case with 16 robots, it is almost twice as fast. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[SimLauncher: Launching Sample-Efficient Real-world Robotic Reinforcement Learning via Simulation Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04452v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection, while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment, which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic RL.</p></details> |  |

We present MLLM-Fabric, a robotic framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for fabric sorting and selection. The system includes a robotic arm, a camera, a visuotactile sensor, and a pressure sensor. It employs supervised fine-tuning and multimodal explanation-guided knowledge distillation to accurately classify and rank fabric properties. To facilitate further research, we release a dataset of 220 unique fabric samples, including RGB images and synchronized visuotactile and pressure data. Experimental results show that our Fabric-Llama-90B model consistently outperforms pretrained vision-language baselines in both property ranking accuracy and selection reliability.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving precise stimulation over prolonged sessions poses significant challenges. By integrating advanced robotics with conventional TMS, robot-assisted TMS (Robo-TMS) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance efficacy and streamline procedures. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive review from an engineering perspective has been notably absent. This paper systematically examines four critical aspects of Robo-TMS: hardware and integration, calibration and registration, neuronavigation systems, and control systems. We review state-of-the-art technologies in each area, identify current limitations, and propose future research directions. Our findings suggest that broader clinical adoption of Robo-TMS is currently limited by unverified clinical applicability, high operational complexity, and substantial implementation costs. Emerging technologies, including marker-less tracking, non-rigid registration, learning-based electric field (E-field) modelling, individualised magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) generation, robot-assisted multi-locus TMS (Robo-mTMS), and automated calibration and registration, present promising pathways to address these challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering</p></details> |

To further increase the efficiency in these environments, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework that systematically schedules and coordinates dual-arm harvesting tasks, minimizing the overall harvesting makespan based on pre-mapped fruit locations. Specifically, we focus on a specialized dual-arm harvesting robot and employ pose coverage analysis of its end effector to maximize picking reachability. Additionally, we compare the performance of the dual-arm configuration with that of a single-arm vehicle, demonstrating that the dual-arm system can nearly double efficiency when fruit densities are roughly equal on both sides. Extensive simulations show a 10-20% increase in throughput and a significant reduction in the number of stops compared to non-optimized methods. These results underscore the advantages of an optimal scheduling approach in improving the scalability and efficiency of robotic harvesting in plant factories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design Optimization of Three-Dimensional Wire Arrangement Considering Wire Crossings for Tendon-driven Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04235v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tendon-driven mechanisms are useful from the perspectives of variable stiffness, redundant actuation, and lightweight design, and they are widely used, particularly in hands, wrists, and waists of robots. The design of these wire arrangements has traditionally been done empirically, but it becomes extremely challenging when dealing with complex structures. Various studies have attempted to optimize wire arrangement, but many of them have oversimplified the problem by imposing conditions such as restricting movements to a 2D plane, keeping the moment arm constant, or neglecting wire crossings. Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional wire arrangement optimization that takes wire crossings into account. We explore wire arrangements through a multi-objective black-box optimization method that ensures wires do not cross while providing sufficient joint torque along a defined target trajectory. For a 3D link structure, we optimize the wire arrangement under various conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness, and discuss the obtained design solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS2025, Website - https://haraduka.github.io/muscle-3d-opt/ , YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy510s-kOaY</p></details> |

Using a Unity-ROS simulation, it compares three agents: a human operator, an immersive VR-controlled robot, and a non-immersive VR-controlled robot. During the scanning phase, humans perform best due to agility and control speed. However, in the treatment phase, immersive VR robots outperform others, completing tasks up to 65% faster by using stored infection data and optimized path planning. In yield-map-based navigation, immersive robots are also 38% faster than humans. Despite slower performance in manual scanning tasks, immersive VR excels in memory-guided, repetitive operations. The study highlights the role of interface design and path optimization, noting limitations in simulation fidelity and generalizability. It concludes that immersive VR has strong potential to enhance efficiency and precision in precision agriculture.</p></details> |  |

The system utilizes a structured Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow that combines transformer-based long dialogue summarization, leadership style modeling, and user response analysis, enabling scalable evaluation of social robots in complex human-robot interaction (HRI) settings. Unlike prior work that focuses on static or task-oriented HRI, HyperSumm-RL captures and hypertextually organizes dynamic conversational exchanges into navigable, semantically rich representations which allows researchers to trace interaction threads, identify influence cues, and analyze leadership framing over time. The contributions of this study are threefold: (1) we present a novel infrastructure for summarizing and linking long, multi-turn dialogues using leadership-style taxonomies; (2) we propose an interactive hypertext model that supports relational navigation across conversational themes, participant responses, and robot behavior modes; and (3) we demonstrate the utility of this system in interpreting participant trust, engagement, and expectation shifts during social robot leadership scenarios. The findings reveal how hypertextual workflows can augment HRI research by enabling transparent, interpretable, and semantically grounded analysis of emergent social dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages with references</p></details> |

As some time has passed since the introduction of these robots during the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0), challenges and issues in their interaction with humans have emerged, leading researchers to conclude that, like any other AI-based technology, these robots must also be human-centered to meet the needs of their users. This chapter aims to introduce humans and their needs in interactions with robots, ranging from short-term, one-on-one interactions (micro-level) to long-term, macro-level needs at the societal scale. Building upon the principles of human-centered AI, this chapter presents, for the first time, a new framework of human needs called the Dual Pyramid. This framework encompasses a comprehensive list of human needs in robot interactions, from the most fundamental, robot effectiveness to macro level requirements, such as the collaboration with robots in achieving the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals.</p></details> |  |

Robots offer an attractive alternative. This paper presents TeachingBot, an adaptive robotic system that teaches handwriting to human learners through physical interaction. Robot teaching poses two major challenges: (i) adapting to the individual handwriting style of the learner and (ii) maintaining an engaging learning experience. For the first challenge, TeachingBot uses a probabilistic model to capture the learner's writing style from their writing samples. Drawing on the insight that effective teaching balances standardization with individuality, the system generates a personalized teaching trajectory that aligns with the learner's natural writing. For the second challenge, TeachingBot employs variable impedance control to guide the learner, dynamically adjusting the strength of physical guidance based on the learner's performance. Human-subject experiments with 15 participants demonstrate the effectiveness of TeachingBot, showing clear improvement in learners' handwriting and engagement over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Coordination between heterogeneous units is paramount for precision tasks -- whether in manipulation, legged locomotion, or multi-robot interaction. Such modular systems introduce challenges far exceeding those in monolithic robot architectures. This study presents a robust method for synchronizing the trajectories of multiple heterogeneous actuators, adapting dynamically to system variations with minimal system knowledge. This design makes it inherently robot-agnostic, thus highly suited for modularity. To ensure smooth trajectory adherence, the multidimensional state is constrained within a hypersphere representing the allowable deviation. The distance metric can be adapted hence, depending on the task and system under control, deformation of the constraint region is possible. This approach is compatible with a wide range of robotic platforms and serves as a core interface for Motion-Stack, our new open-source universal framework for limb coordination (available at https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack ). The method is validated by synchronizing the end-effectors of six highly heterogeneous robotic limbs, evaluating both trajectory adherence and recovery from significant external disturbances.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 15 figures.

| **[Boundary Exploration of Next Best View Policy in 3D Robotic Scanning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10444v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Next Best View (NBV) problem is a pivotal challenge in 3D robotic scanning, with the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of object capture and reconstruction. Existing methods for determining the NBV often overlook view overlap, assume a fixed virtual origin for the camera, and rely on voxel-based representations of 3D data. To address these limitations and enhance the practicality of scanning unknown objects, we propose an NBV policy in which the next view explores the boundary of the scanned point cloud, with overlap intrinsically considered. The scanning or working distance of the camera is user-defined and remains flexible throughout the process. To this end, we first introduce a model-based approach in which candidate views are iteratively proposed based on a reference model. Scores are computed using a carefully designed strategy that accounts for both view overlap and convergence. In addition, we propose a learning-based method, the Boundary Exploration NBV Network (BENBV-Net), which predicts the NBV directly from the scanned data without requiring a reference model. BENBV-Net estimates scores for candidate boundaries, selecting the one with the highest score as the target for the next best view. It offers a significant improvement in NBV generation speed while maintaining the performance level of the model-based approach. We evaluate both methods on the ShapeNet, ModelNet, and 3D Repository datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of scanning efficiency, final coverage, and overlap stability, all of which are critical for practical 3D scanning applications.

Given a language command and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://rigvid-robot.github.io/</p></details> |

In this work, we present a multi-robot aerial soft manipulator for floating litter collection, leveraging the capabilities of aerial robots. The proposed system consists of two aerial robots connected by a flexible rope manipulator, which collects floating litter using a hook-based tool. Compared to single-aerial-robot solutions, the use of two aerial robots increases payload capacity and flight endurance while reducing the downwash effect at the manipulation point, located at the midpoint of the rope. Additionally, we employ an optimization-based rope-shape planner to compute the desired rope shape. The planner incorporates an adaptive behavior that maximizes grasping capabilities near the litter while minimizing rope tension when farther away. The computed rope shape trajectory is controlled by a shape visual servoing controller, which approximates the rope as a parabola. The complete system is validated in outdoor experiments, demonstrating successful grasping operations. An ablation study highlights how the planner's adaptive mechanism improves the success rate of the operation. Furthermore, real-world tests in a water channel confirm the effectiveness of our system in floating litter collection. These results demonstrate the potential of aerial robots for autonomous litter removal in aquatic environments.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address the problem of inserting a hanger into various unseen garments that are initially laid flat on a table. This task is challenging due to its long-horizon nature, the high degrees of freedom of the garments and the lack of data. To simplify the learning process, we first propose breaking the task into several subtasks. Then, we formulate each subtask as a policy learning problem and propose a low-dimensional action parameterization. To overcome the challenge of limited data, we build our own simulator and create 144 synthetic clothing assets to effectively collect high-quality training data. Our approach uses single-view depth images and object masks as input, which mitigates the Sim2Real appearance gap and achieves high generalization capabilities for new garments. Extensive experiments in both simulation and reality validate our proposed method. By training on various garments in the simulator, our method achieves a 75\% success rate with 8 different unseen garments in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://pku-epic.github.io/RoboHanger/</p></details> |

However, existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream visuomotor tasks.

| **[Learning Video Generation for Robotic Manipulation with Collaborative Trajectory Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01943v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further enabling fine-grained control. However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |

However, these tools often overlook the intrinsic physicality of the human drawing/writing act, which is usually executed with skillful hand/arm gestures. Taking this into account is important for the visual aesthetics of the results and for the development of closer and more intuitive artist-robot collaboration scenarios. We present a method that bridges this gap by enabling gradient-based optimization of natural human-like motions guided by cost functions defined in image space. To this end, we use the sigma-lognormal model of human hand/arm movements, with an adaptation that enables its use in conjunction with a differentiable vector graphics (DiffVG) renderer. We demonstrate how this pipeline can be used to generate feasible trajectories for a robot by combining image-driven objectives with a minimum-time smoothing criterion. We demonstrate applications with generation and robotic reproduction of synthetic graffiti as well as image abstraction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE RO-MAN 2025</p></details> |

Previous MR fabrication projects have primarily relied on digital menus and custom buttons as the interface for user interaction with the MR environment. Despite this approach being widely adopted, it is limited in its ability to allow for direct human interaction with physical objects to modify fabrication instructions within the MR environment. This research integrates user interactions with physical objects through real-time gesture recognition as input to modify, update or generate new digital information enabling reciprocal stimuli between the physical and the virtual environment. Consequently, the digital environment is generative of the user's provided interaction with physical objects to allow seamless feedback in the fabrication process. This research investigates gesture recognition for feedback-based MR workflows for robotic fabrication, human assembly, and quality control in the construction of the UnLog Tower.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures.

| **[Making Physical Objects with Generative AI and Robotic Assembly: Considering Fabrication Constraints, Sustainability, Time, Functionality, and Accessibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19131v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D generative AI enables rapid and accessible creation of 3D models from text or image inputs. However, translating these outputs into physical objects remains a challenge due to the constraints in the physical world. Recent studies have focused on improving the capabilities of 3D generative AI to produce fabricable outputs, with 3D printing as the main fabrication method. However, this workshop paper calls for a broader perspective by considering how fabrication methods align with the capabilities of 3D generative AI. As a case study, we present a novel system using discrete robotic assembly and 3D generative AI to make physical objects. Through this work, we identified five key aspects to consider in a physical making process based on the capabilities of 3D generative AI. 1) Fabrication Constraints: Current text-to-3D models can generate a wide range of 3D designs, requiring fabrication methods that can adapt to the variability of generative AI outputs. 2) Time: While generative AI can generate 3D models in seconds, fabricating physical objects can take hours or even days. Faster production could enable a closer iterative design loop between humans and AI in the making process. 3) Sustainability: Although text-to-3D models can generate thousands of models in the digital world, extending this capability to the real world would be resource-intensive, unsustainable and irresponsible. 4) Functionality: Unlike digital outputs from 3D generative AI models, the fabrication method plays a crucial role in the usability of physical objects. 5) Accessibility: While generative AI simplifies 3D model creation, the need for fabrication equipment can limit participation, making AI-assisted creation less inclusive. These five key aspects provide a framework for assessing how well a physical making process aligns with the capabilities of 3D generative AI and values in the world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the CHI 2025 Workshop on Generative AI and HCI</p></details> |
| **[Towards autonomous photogrammetric forest inventory using a lightweight under-canopy robotic drone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12073v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drones are increasingly used in forestry to capture high-resolution remote sensing data, supporting enhanced monitoring, assessment, and decision-making processes. While operations above the forest canopy are already highly automated, flying inside forests remains challenging, primarily relying on manual piloting. Inside dense forests, reliance on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for localization is not feasible. Additionally, the drone must autonomously adjust its flight path to avoid collisions. Recently, advancements in robotics have enabled autonomous drone flights in GNSS-denied obstacle-rich areas. In this article, a step towards autonomous forest data collection is taken by building a prototype of a robotic under-canopy drone utilizing state-of-the-art open-source methods and validating its performance for data collection inside forests. Specifically, the study focused on camera-based autonomous flight under the forest canopy and photogrammetric post-processing of the data collected with the low-cost onboard stereo camera. The autonomous flight capability of the prototype was evaluated through multiple test flights at boreal forests. The tree parameter estimation capability was studied by performing diameter at breast height (DBH) estimation. The prototype successfully carried out flights in selected challenging forest environments, and the experiments showed excellent performance in forest 3D modeling with a miniaturized stereoscopic photogrammetric system. The DBH estimation achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.33 cm (12.79 \%) across all trees. For trees with a DBH less than 30 cm, the RMSE was 1.16 cm (5.74 \%). The results provide valuable insights into autonomous under-canopy forest mapping and highlight the critical next steps for advancing lightweight robotic drone systems for mapping complex forest environments.</p></details> | 36 pages, 11 Figures |

Although recent automated techniques reduce the need for manual tuning, they tend to fall short by not adequately bridging the gap between human preferences and model predictions-resulting in a deficiency of nuanced and realistic expressions due to limited degrees of freedom and insufficient perceptual integration. In this work, we propose a novel learning-to-rank framework that leverages human feedback to address this discrepancy and enhanced the expressiveness of robotic faces. Specifically, we conduct pairwise comparison annotations to collect human preference data and develop the Human Affective Pairwise Impressions (HAPI) model, a Siamese RankNet-based approach that refines expression evaluation. Results obtained via Bayesian Optimization and online expression survey on a 35-DOF android platform demonstrate that our approach produces significantly more realistic and socially resonant expressions of Anger, Happiness, and Surprise than those generated by baseline and expert-designed methods. This confirms that our framework effectively bridges the gap between human preferences and model predictions while robustly aligning robotic expression generation with human affective responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

Although existing autoregressive VLA methods design a specific architecture like dual-system to leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they tend to capture static information, often neglecting the dynamic aspects vital for embodied tasks. To this end, we propose TriVLA, a unified Vision-Language-Action model with a triple-system architecture for general robot control. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The dynamics perception module (System 3) inherently produces visual representations that encompass both current static information and predicted future dynamics, thereby providing valuable guidance for policy learning. TriVLA utilizes pre-trained VLM model and fine-tunes pre-trained video foundation model on robot datasets along with internet human manipulation data. The subsequent policy learning module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that TriVLA operates at approximately 36 Hz and surpasses state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks as well as challenging real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Using data collected from RoboCup competitions, the model predicts joint command trajectories from multi-modal sensor inputs, including vision, proprioception, and game state. We employ a distillation technique to enable real-time inference on embedded platforms that reduces the multi-step diffusion process to a single step. Our results demonstrate the model's ability to replicate complex motion behaviors such as walking, kicking, and fall recovery both in simulation and on physical robots. Although high-level tactical behavior remains limited, this work provides a robust foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning or preference optimization methods.

However, most existing datasets exclude deformable bodies due to the lack of scalable, robust simulation pipelines, limiting the development of generalizable models for compliant grippers and soft manipulands. To address these challenges, we present GRIP, a General Robotic Incremental Potential contact simulation dataset for universal grasping. GRIP leverages an optimized Incremental Potential Contact (IPC)-based simulator for multi-environment data generation, achieving up to 48x speedup while ensuring efficient, intersection- and inversion-free simulations for compliant grippers and deformable objects. Our fully automated pipeline generates and evaluates diverse grasp interactions across 1,200 objects and 100,000 grasp poses, incorporating both soft and rigid grippers.

The emerging domain of eXplainable HRI (XHRI) investigates methods to generate explanations and evaluate their impact on human-robot interactions. Previous works have highlighted the need to personalise the level of detail of these explanations to enhance usability and comprehension. Our paper presents a framework designed to update and retrieve user knowledge-memory models, allowing for adapting the explanations' level of detail while referencing previously acquired concepts. Three architectures based on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen assistant robot. Experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage architecture, which first generates an explanation and then personalises it, is the framework architecture that effectively reduces the level of detail only when there is related user knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

We innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD), which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos. Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex, robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA models. Our RGCD is publicly available at: https://github.com/IntMeGroup/RGC-VQA.</p></details> |  |

Originally developed for testing and usage on a marine autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), this approach can also be utilized on other mobile systems. Building upon the original proprioceptive only DRIFT algorithm, we develop a symmetry-preserving sensor fusion pipeline utilizing the invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) to integrate global position updates from GPS directly into the correction step. Crucially, we introduce a novel heading correction mechanism that leverages GPS course-over-ground information in conjunction with IMU orientation, overcoming the inherent unobservability of yaw in dead-reckoning. The system was deployed and validated on a customized Blue Robotics BlueBoat, but the methodological focus is on the algorithmic approach to fusing exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensors for drift-free localization and reliable orientation estimation. This work provides an open source solution for accurate yaw observation and localization in challenging or GPS-degraded conditions, and lays the groundwork for future experimental and comparative studies.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Towards Bio-Inspired Robotic Trajectory Planning via Self-Supervised RNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02171v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment. Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks requiring adaptive solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

The generated paths can then be tracked using vision-based control, eliminating the need for an explicit robot model or proprioceptive sensing. At the core of our approach is the construction of a roadmap entirely in image space. To achieve this, we explicitly define sampling, nearest-neighbor selection, and collision checking based on visual features rather than geometric models. We first collect a set of image-space samples by moving the robot within its workspace, capturing keypoints along its body at different configurations. These samples serve as nodes in the roadmap, which we construct using either learned or predefined distance metrics. At runtime, the roadmap generates collision-free paths directly in image space, removing the need for a robot model or joint encoders. We validate our approach through an experimental study in which a robotic arm follows planned paths using an adaptive vision-based control scheme to avoid obstacles. The results show that paths generated with the learned-distance roadmap achieved 100% success in control convergence, whereas the predefined image-space distance roadmap enabled faster transient responses but had a lower success rate in convergence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Koopman Model Predictive Control of Simple Serial Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17902v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximating nonlinear systems as linear ones is a common workaround to apply control tools tailored for linear systems. This motivates our present work where we developed a data-driven model predictive controller (MPC) based on the Koopman operator framework, allowing the embedding of nonlinear dynamics in a higher dimensional, but linear function space. The controller, termed adaptive Koopman model predictive control (KMPC), uses online closed-loop feedback to learn and incrementally update a linear representation of nonlinear system dynamics, without the prior knowledge of a model. Adaptive KMPC differs from most other Koopman-based control frameworks that aim to identify high-validity-range models in advance and then enter closed-loop control without further model adaptations. To validate the controller, trajectory tracking experiments are conducted with 1R and 2R robots under force disturbances and changing model parameters. We compare the controller to classical linearization MPC and Koopman-based MPC without model updates, denoted static KMPC. The results show that adaptive KMPC can, opposed to static KMPC, generalize over unforeseen force disturbances and can, opposed to linearization MPC, handle varying dynamic parameters, while using a small set of basis functions to approximate the Koopman operator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

A central challenge in these systems is aligning independently collected perception data across space and time, i.e., multi-robot data association. While recent advances in collaborative SLAM (C-SLAM), map merging, and inter-robot loop closure detection have significantly progressed the field, evaluation strategies still predominantly rely on splitting a single trajectory from single-robot SLAM datasets into multiple segments to simulate multiple robots. Without careful consideration to how a single trajectory is split, this approach will fail to capture realistic pose-dependent variation in observations of a scene inherent to multi-robot systems. To address this gap, we present CU-Multi, a multi-robot dataset collected over multiple days at two locations on the University of Colorado Boulder campus. Using a single robotic platform, we generate four synchronized runs with aligned start times and deliberate percentages of trajectory overlap. CU-Multi includes RGB-D, GPS with accurate geospatial heading, and semantically annotated LiDAR data. By introducing controlled variations in trajectory overlap and dense lidar annotations, CU-Multi offers a compelling alternative for evaluating methods in multi-robot data association.

Such systems often comprise sparsely activated experts combined under a single monolithic architecture and require a well-configured internal routing mechanism, which does not allow for selective low-level expert and router customization and requires additional training. We propose MoIRA, an architecture-agnostic modular MoE framework designed to coordinate existing experts with an external text-based router. MoIRA incorporates two zero-shot routing options: embedding-based similarity and prompt-driven language model inference. In our experiments, we choose large Vision-Language-Action models, gr00t-N1 and $\pi_0$, as the underlying experts, and train low-rank adapters for low-overhead inference. We evaluate MoIRA on various GR1 Humanoid tasks and LIBERO Spatial and Goal benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms generalist models and competes with other MoE pipelines. Additionally, we analyse the robustness of the proposed approach to the variations of the instructions. While relying solely on textual descriptions of tasks and experts, MoIRA demonstrates the practical viability of modular deployment with precise, low-effort routing and provides an alternative, scalable foundation for future multi-expert robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of a manuscript submitted for peer review</p></details> |

These constraints prevent medical screws from following anatomically optimal pathways and force clinicians to fixate screws in linear trajectories. This suboptimal approach, combined with the unnatural placement of the excessively long screws, lead to complications such as screw misplacement, extended surgery times, and increased radiation exposure due to repeated X-ray images taken ensure to safety of procedure. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present the design and development of a unique 4 degree-of-freedom (DoF) pelvic concentric tube steerable drilling robot (pelvic CT-SDR). The pelvic CT-SDR is capable of creating long S-shaped drilling trajectories that follow the natural curvatures of the pelvic anatomy. The performance of the pelvic CT-SDR was thoroughly evaluated through several S-shape drilling experiments in simulated bone phantoms.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we propose a four-Phase calibration, registration, and navigation procedure to perform realistic SF procedures on a spine holder phantom by integrating the CT-SDR with a seven-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator. The functionality of this framework is validated through planar and out-of-plane steerable drilling experiments in vertebral phantoms.</p></details> |  |

In this concept, two connecting J-shape tunnels are first drilled through pedicles of vertebra using the CT-SDR. Next, two FPSs are passed through this tunnel and bone cement is then injected through the cannulated region of the FPS to form an augmented bridge between two pedicles and reinforce strength of the fixated spine. To experimentally analyze and study the feasibility of AB-SF technique, we first used our robotic system (i.e., a CT-SDR integrated with a robotic arm) to create two different fixation scenarios in which two J-shape tunnels, forming a bridge, were drilled at different depth of a vertebral phantom. Next, we implanted two FPSs within the drilled tunnels and then successfully simulated the bone cement augmentation process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Collision Detection for Long and Slender Robotic Links in Euclidean Distance Fields: Application to a Forestry Crane](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01705v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collision-free motion planning in complex outdoor environments relies heavily on perceiving the surroundings through exteroceptive sensors. A widely used approach represents the environment as a voxelized Euclidean distance field, where robots are typically approximated by spheres. However, for large-scale manipulators such as forestry cranes, which feature long and slender links, this conventional spherical approximation becomes inefficient and inaccurate. This work presents a novel collision detection algorithm specifically designed to exploit the elongated structure of such manipulators, significantly enhancing the computational efficiency of motion planning algorithms. Unlike traditional sphere decomposition methods, our approach not only improves computational efficiency but also naturally eliminates the need to fine-tune the approximation accuracy as an additional parameter. We validate the algorithm's effectiveness using real-world LiDAR data from a forestry crane application, as well as simulated environment data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Co-design of magnetic soft robots with large deformation and contacts via material point method and topology optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22767v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic soft robots embedded with hard magnetic particles enable untethered actuation via external magnetic fields, offering remote, rapid, and precise control, which is highly promising for biomedical applications. However, designing such systems is challenging due to the complex interplay of magneto-elastic dynamics, large deformation, solid contacts, time-varying stimuli, and posture-dependent loading. As a result, most existing research relies on heuristics and trial-and-error methods or focuses on the independent design of stimuli or structures under static conditions. We propose a topology optimization framework for magnetic soft robots that simultaneously designs structures, location-specific material magnetization and time-varying magnetic stimuli, accounting for large deformations, dynamic motion, and solid contacts. This is achieved by integrating generalized topology optimization with the magneto-elastic material point method, which supports GPU-accelerated parallel simulations and auto-differentiation for sensitivity analysis. We applied this framework to design magnetic robots for various tasks, including multi-task shape morphing and locomotion, in both 2D and 3D. The method autonomously generates optimized robotic systems to achieve target behaviors without requiring human intervention. Despite the nonlinear physics and large design space, it demonstrates high computational efficiency, completing all cases within minutes. The framework provides a computational foundation for the autonomous co-design of active soft materials in applications such as metasurfaces, drug delivery, and minimally invasive procedures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Legged Robot State Estimation Using Invariant Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter with a Neural Compensator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00344v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an algorithm to improve state estimation for legged robots. Among existing model-based state estimation methods for legged robots, the contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter defines the state on a Lie group to preserve invariance, thereby significantly accelerating convergence. It achieves more accurate state estimation by leveraging contact information as measurements for the update step. However, when the model exhibits strong nonlinearity, the estimation accuracy decreases. Such nonlinearities can cause initial errors to accumulate and lead to large drifts over time. To address this issue, we propose compensating for errors by augmenting the Kalman filter with an artificial neural network serving as a nonlinear function approximator. Furthermore, we design this neural network to respect the Lie group structure to ensure invariance, resulting in our proposed Invariant Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter (InNKF).

| **[Effective Explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention Robots: When and What to Explain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02016v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When robots perform complex and context-dependent tasks in our daily lives, deviations from expectations can confuse users. Explanations of the robot's reasoning process can help users to understand the robot intentions. However, when to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user annoyance. We have investigated user preferences for explanation demand and content for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our results show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer concise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing action and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on these findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to construct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots. Our algorithms can be easily integrated in the BDI reasoning process and pave the way for better human-robot interaction with context- and user-specific explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at IEEE RO-MAN 2025; 6 pages</p></details> |

Especially the need for predetermined models and historic data is problematic because they do not encompass the dynamic and fast-changing nature of such systems. To this end, we propose a concept that actively generates a dynamic system model at runtime and utilizes it to locate root causes. The goal is to be applicable to all kinds of robotic systems that share a similar software design. Additionally, it should exhibit minimal overhead and enhance independence from expert attention.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Ada User Journal</p></details> |
| **[Collision-Free Robot Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12019v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots are becoming an increasingly common part of scientific work within laboratory environments. In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing \emph{schedules} for completing a set of tasks at fixed locations with multiple robots in a laboratory. We represent the laboratory as a graph with tasks placed on fixed vertices and robots represented as agents, with the constraint that no two robots may occupy the same vertex at any given timestep. Each schedule is partitioned into a set of timesteps, corresponding to a walk through the graph (allowing for a robot to wait at a vertex to complete a task), with each timestep taking time equal to the time for a robot to move from one vertex to another and each task taking some given number of timesteps during the completion of which a robot must stay at the vertex containing the task. The goal is to determine a set of schedules, with one schedule for each robot, minimising the number of timesteps taken by the schedule taking the greatest number of timesteps within the set of schedules. We show that this problem is NP-complete for many simple classes of graphs, the problem of determining the fastest schedule, defined by the number of time steps required for a robot to visit every vertex in the schedule and complete every task assigned in its assigned schedule. Explicitly, we provide this result for complete graphs, bipartite graphs, star graphs, and planar graphs. Finally, we provide positive results for line graphs, showing that we can find an optimal set of schedules for $k$ robots completing $m$ tasks of equal length of a path of length $n$ in $O(kmn)$ time, and a $k$-approximation when the length of the tasks is unbounded.</p></details> |  |
| **[BioMARS: A Multi-Agent Robotic System for Autonomous Biological Experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01485v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have the potential to transform biological research by enabling autonomous experimentation. Yet, their application remains constrained by rigid protocol design, limited adaptability to dynamic lab conditions, inadequate error handling, and high operational complexity. Here we introduce BioMARS (Biological Multi-Agent Robotic System), an intelligent platform that integrates LLMs, VLMs, and modular robotics to autonomously design, plan, and execute biological experiments. BioMARS uses a hierarchical architecture: the Biologist Agent synthesizes protocols via retrieval-augmented generation; the Technician Agent translates them into executable robotic pseudo-code; and the Inspector Agent ensures procedural integrity through multimodal perception and anomaly detection. The system autonomously conducts cell passaging and culture tasks, matching or exceeding manual performance in viability, consistency, and morphological integrity. It also supports context-aware optimization, outperforming conventional strategies in differentiating retinal pigment epithelial cells. A web interface enables real-time human-AI collaboration, while a modular backend allows scalable integration with laboratory hardware. These results highlight the feasibility of generalizable, AI-driven laboratory automation and the transformative role of language-based reasoning in biological research.</p></details> |  |

| **[DexH2R: A Benchmark for Dynamic Dexterous Grasping in Human-to-Robot Handover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23152v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handover between a human and a dexterous robotic hand is a fundamental yet challenging task in human-robot collaboration. It requires handling dynamic environments and a wide variety of objects and demands robust and adaptive grasping strategies. However, progress in developing effective dynamic dexterous grasping methods is limited by the absence of high-quality, real-world human-to-robot handover datasets. Existing datasets primarily focus on grasping static objects or rely on synthesized handover motions, which differ significantly from real-world robot motion patterns, creating a substantial gap in applicability. In this paper, we introduce DexH2R, a comprehensive real-world dataset for human-to-robot handovers, built on a dexterous robotic hand. Our dataset captures a diverse range of interactive objects, dynamic motion patterns, rich visual sensor data, and detailed annotations. Additionally, to ensure natural and human-like dexterous motions, we utilize teleoperation for data collection, enabling the robot's movements to align with human behaviors and habits, which is a crucial characteristic for intelligent humanoid robots. Furthermore, we propose an effective solution, DynamicGrasp, for human-to-robot handover and evaluate various state-of-the-art approaches, including auto-regressive models and diffusion policy methods, providing a thorough comparison and analysis. We believe our benchmark will drive advancements in human-to-robot handover research by offering a high-quality dataset, effective solutions, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: Accepted by ICCV 2025.

| **[High-Precision Transformer-Based Visual Servoing for Humanoid Robots in Aligning Tiny Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04862v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-precision tiny object alignment remains a common and critical challenge for humanoid robots in real-world. To address this problem, this paper proposes a vision-based framework for precisely estimating and controlling the relative position between a handheld tool and a target object for humanoid robots, e.g., a screwdriver tip and a screw head slot. By fusing images from the head and torso cameras on a robot with its head joint angles, the proposed Transformer-based visual servoing method can correct the handheld tool's positional errors effectively, especially at a close distance. Experiments on M4-M8 screws demonstrate an average convergence error of 0.8-1.3 mm and a success rate of 93\%-100\%. Through comparative analysis, the results validate that this capability of high-precision tiny object alignment is enabled by the Distance Estimation Transformer architecture and the Multi-Perception-Head mechanism proposed in this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>for a...</summary><p>for associated video, see https://b23.tv/cklF7aK</p></details> |

The recent emergence of neural implicit representations has introduced significant advances to these domains, enabling numerous novel capabilities. Among these, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have gained considerable attention because of their considerable representational advantages, such as simplified mathematical models, low memory footprint, and continuous scene representations. In addition to computer vision, NeRFs have demonstrated significant potential in robotics. Thus, we present this survey to provide a comprehensive understanding of NeRFs in the field of robotics. By exploring the advantages and limitations of NeRF as well as its current applications and future potential, we aim to provide an overview of this promising area of research. Our survey is divided into two main sections: \textit{Applications of NeRFs in Robotics} and \textit{Advances for NeRFs in Robotics}, from the perspective of how NeRF enters the field of robotics. In the first section, we introduce and analyze some works that have been or could be used in robotics for perception and interaction tasks. In the second section, we show some works related to improving NeRF's own properties, which are essential for deploying NeRFs in robotics. In the discussion section of the review, we summarize the existing challenges and provide valuable future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 19 figures, accepted by The International Journal of Robotics Research, 2025</p></details> |

This evolution poses challenges in machine perception, especially for tasks like 3D object pose estimation in complex, dynamic environments. Our project addresses critical issues in human-robot interaction within mobile AR, focusing on non-intrusive, spatially aware interfaces. We present URSA, an LLM-driven immersive AR system developed for NASA's 2023-2024 SUITS challenge, targeting future spaceflight needs such as the Artemis missions. URSA integrates three core technologies: a head-mounted AR device (e.g., HoloLens) for intuitive visual feedback, voice control powered by large language models for hands-free interaction, and robot tracking algorithms that enable accurate 3D localization in dynamic settings. To enhance precision, we leverage digital twin localization technologies, using datasets like DTTD-Mobile and specialized hardware such as the ZED2 camera for real-world tracking under noise and occlusion. Our system enables real-time robot control and monitoring via an AR interface, even in the absence of ground-truth sensors--vital for hazardous or remote operations. Key contributions include: (1) a non-intrusive AR interface with LLM-based voice input; (2) a ZED2-based dataset tailored for non-rigid robotic bodies; (3) a Local Mission Control Console (LMCC) for mission visualization; (4) a transformer-based 6DoF pose estimator (DTTDNet) optimized for depth fusion and real-time tracking; and (5) end-to-end integration for astronaut mission support. This work advances digital twin applications in robotics, offering scalable solutions for both aerospace and industrial domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Search-Based Robot Motion Planning With Distance-Based Adaptive Motion Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01198v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a motion planning algorithm for robotic manipulators that combines sampling-based and search-based planning methods. The core contribution of the proposed approach is the usage of burs of free configuration space (C-space) as adaptive motion primitives within the graph search algorithm. Due to their feature to adaptively expand in free C-space, burs enable more efficient exploration of the configuration space compared to fixed-sized motion primitives, significantly reducing the time to find a valid path and the number of required expansions. The algorithm is implemented within the existing SMPL (Search-Based Motion Planning Library) library and evaluated through a series of different scenarios involving manipulators with varying number of degrees-of-freedom (DoF) and environment complexity. Results demonstrate that the bur-based approach outperforms fixed-primitive planning in complex scenarios, particularly for high DoF manipulators, while achieving comparable performance in simpler scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to a conference</p></details> |
| **[A Differentiable Distance Metric for Robotics Through Generalized Alternating Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01181v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many robotics applications, it is necessary to compute not only the distance between the robot and the environment, but also its derivative - for example, when using control barrier functions. However, since the traditional Euclidean distance is not differentiable, there is a need for alternative distance metrics that possess this property. Recently, a metric with guaranteed differentiability was proposed [1]. This approach has some important drawbacks, which we address in this paper. We provide much simpler and practical expressions for the smooth projection for general convex polytopes. Additionally, as opposed to [1], we ensure that the distance vanishes as the objects overlap. We show the efficacy of the approach in experimental results. Our proposed distance metric is publicly available through the Python-based simulation package UAIBot.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

While existing quadrupedal-limbed robots have demonstrated impressive dexterous capabilities, achieving a balance between power-demanding locomotion and precise grasping remains a critical challenge. We design a torso mechanism and a parallel-serial limb to meet the conflicting requirements that pose unique challenges in hardware design. SCALER employs underactuated two-fingered GOAT grippers that can mechanically adapt and offer seven modes of grasping, enabling SCALER to traverse extreme terrains with multi-modal grasping strategies. We study the whole-body approach, where SCALER utilizes its body and limbs to generate additional forces for stable grasping in various environments, thereby further enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we improve the GOAT gripper actuation speed to realize more dynamic climbing in a closed-loop control fashion. With these proposed technologies, SCALER can traverse vertical, overhanging, upside-down, slippery terrains and bouldering walls with non-convex-shaped climbing holds under the Earth's gravity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2025</p></details> |
| **[SonoGym: High Performance Simulation for Challenging Surgical Tasks with Robotic Ultrasound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01152v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultrasound (US) is a widely used medical imaging modality due to its real-time capabilities, non-invasive nature, and cost-effectiveness. Robotic ultrasound can further enhance its utility by reducing operator dependence and improving access to complex anatomical regions. For this, while deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and imitation learning (IL) have shown potential for autonomous navigation, their use in complex surgical tasks such as anatomy reconstruction and surgical guidance remains limited -- largely due to the lack of realistic and efficient simulation environments tailored to these tasks. We introduce SonoGym, a scalable simulation platform for complex robotic ultrasound tasks that enables parallel simulation across tens to hundreds of environments. Our framework supports realistic and real-time simulation of US data from CT-derived 3D models of the anatomy through both a physics-based and a generative modeling approach. Sonogym enables the training of DRL and recent IL agents (vision transformers and diffusion policies) for relevant tasks in robotic orthopedic surgery by integrating common robotic platforms and orthopedic end effectors. We further incorporate submodular DRL -- a recent method that handles history-dependent rewards -- for anatomy reconstruction and safe reinforcement learning for surgery. Our results demonstrate successful policy learning across a range of scenarios, while also highlighting the limitations of current methods in clinically relevant environments. We believe our simulation can facilitate research in robot learning approaches for such challenging robotic surgery applications. Dataset, codes, and videos are publicly available at https://sonogym.github.io/.</p></details> | 21 pages, 15 figures |
| **[A Review on Sound Source Localization in Robotics: Focusing on Deep Learning Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01143v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound source localization (SSL) adds a spatial dimension to auditory perception, allowing a system to pinpoint the origin of speech, machinery noise, warning tones, or other acoustic events, capabilities that facilitate robot navigation, human-machine dialogue, and condition monitoring. While existing surveys provide valuable historical context, they typically address general audio applications and do not fully account for robotic constraints or the latest advancements in deep learning. This review addresses these gaps by offering a robotics-focused synthesis, emphasizing recent progress in deep learning methodologies. We start by reviewing classical methods such as Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), beamforming, Steered-Response Power (SRP), and subspace analysis. Subsequently, we delve into modern machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches, discussing traditional ML and neural networks (NNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), and emerging attention-based architectures. The data and training strategy that are the two cornerstones of DL-based SSL are explored. Studies are further categorized by robot types and application domains to facilitate researchers in identifying relevant work for their specific contexts. Finally, we highlight the current challenges in SSL works in general, regarding environmental robustness, sound source multiplicity, and specific implementation constraints in robotics, as well as data and learning strategies in DL-based SSL. Also, we sketch promising directions to offer an actionable roadmap toward robust, adaptable, efficient, and explainable DL-based SSL for next-generation robots.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[VISTA: Open-Vocabulary, Task-Relevant Robot Exploration with Online Semantic Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01125v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present VISTA (Viewpoint-based Image selection with Semantic Task Awareness), an active exploration method for robots to plan informative trajectories that improve 3D map quality in areas most relevant for task completion. Given an open-vocabulary search instruction (e.g., "find a person"), VISTA enables a robot to explore its environment to search for the object of interest, while simultaneously building a real-time semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of the scene. The robot navigates its environment by planning receding-horizon trajectories that prioritize semantic similarity to the query and exploration of unseen regions of the environment. To evaluate trajectories, VISTA introduces a novel, efficient viewpoint-semantic coverage metric that quantifies both the geometric view diversity and task relevance in the 3D scene. On static datasets, our coverage metric outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, FisherRF and Bayes' Rays, in computation speed and reconstruction quality. In quadrotor hardware experiments, VISTA achieves 6x higher success rates in challenging maps, compared to baseline methods, while matching baseline performance in less challenging maps. Lastly, we show that VISTA is platform-agnostic by deploying it on a quadrotor drone and a Spot quadruped robot. Open-source code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
