| **[Towards Robust and Secure Embodied AI: A Survey on Vulnerabilities and Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13175v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, including robots and autonomous vehicles, are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, where they encounter a range of vulnerabilities stemming from both environmental and system-level factors. These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Pattern Recognition Letters.

| **[OpenFly: A Versatile Toolchain and Large-scale Benchmark for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents through an environment by leveraging both language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[MapNav: A Novel Memory Representation via Annotated Semantic Maps for VLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13451v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a key task in Embodied AI, requiring agents to navigate diverse and unseen environments while following natural language instructions. Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defining and Evaluating Visual Language Models' Basic Spatial Abilities: A Perspective from Psychometrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11859v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Theory of Multiple Intelligences underscores the hierarchical nature of cognitive capabilities. To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[MindForge: Empowering Embodied Agents with Theory of Mind for Lifelong Collaborative Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12977v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs), such as Voyager, have shown promising capabilities in individual learning within open-ended environments like Minecraft. However, when powered by open LLMs, they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a multicomponent memory system. In Minecraft experiments, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks where traditional Voyager fails without GPT-4, collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items and achieving $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones, advancing from basic wood tools to advanced iron equipment. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated collaborative experiences. MindForge advances the democratization of embodied AI development through open-ended social learning, enabling peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sce2DriveX: A Generalized MLLM Framework for Scene-to-Drive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14917v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving, which directly maps raw sensor inputs to low-level vehicle controls, is an important part of Embodied AI. Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoFar: Language-Grounded Orientation Bridges Spatial Reasoning and Object Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13143v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence is a critical component of embodied AI, promoting robots to understand and interact with their environments. While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |
| **[Generative Multi-Agent Collaboration in Embodied AI: A Systematic Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11518v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied multi-agent systems (EMAS) have attracted growing attention for their potential to address complex, real-world challenges in areas such as logistics and robotics. Recent advances in foundation models pave the way for generative agents capable of richer communication and adaptive problem-solving. This survey provides a systematic examination of how EMAS can benefit from these generative capabilities. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes EMAS by system architectures and embodiment modalities, emphasizing how collaboration spans both physical and virtual contexts. Central building blocks, perception, planning, communication, and feedback, are then analyzed to illustrate how generative techniques bolster system robustness and flexibility. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the transformative effects of integrating foundation models into embodied, multi-agent frameworks. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions, underlining the significant promise of EMAS to reshape the landscape of AI-driven collaboration.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Object-Centric Latent Action Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09680v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging vast amounts of internet video data for Embodied AI is currently bottle-necked by the lack of action annotations and the presence of action-correlated distractors. We propose a novel object-centric latent action learning approach, based on VideoSaur and LAPO, that employs self-supervised decomposition of scenes into object representations and annotates video data with proxy-action labels. This method effectively disentangles causal agent-object interactions from irrelevant background noise and reduces the performance degradation of latent action learning approaches caused by distractors. Our preliminary experiments with the Distracting Control Suite show that latent action pretraining based on object decompositions improve the quality of inferred latent actions by x2.7 and efficiency of downstream fine-tuning with a small set of labeled actions, increasing return by x2.6 on average.</p></details> | Preprint.

| **[POEX: Understanding and Mitigating Policy Executable Jailbreak Attacks against Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16633v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems are rapidly evolving due to the integration of LLMs as planning modules, which transform complex instructions into executable policies. However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[TorchResist: Open-Source Differentiable Resist Simulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06838v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent decades have witnessed remarkable advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), image and video generative models, and embodied AI systems. These advancements have led to an explosive increase in the demand for computational power, challenging the limits of Moore's Law. Optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing, faces significant challenges due to its high costs. To address this, various lithography simulators have been developed. However, many of these simulators are limited by their inadequate photoresist modeling capabilities. This paper presents TorchResist, an open-source, differentiable photoresist simulator.TorchResist employs an analytical approach to model the photoresist process, functioning as a white-box system with at most twenty interpretable parameters. Leveraging modern differentiable programming techniques and parallel computing on GPUs, TorchResist enables seamless co-optimization with other tools across multiple related tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that TorchResist achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing solutions. The source code is publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>SPIE ...</summary><p>SPIE Advanced Lithography + Patterning, 2025</p></details> |
| **[BadRobot: Jailbreaking Embodied LLMs in the Physical World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20242v4)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI represents systems where AI is integrated into physical entities. Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[LSceneLLM: Enhancing Large 3D Scene Understanding Using Adaptive Visual Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01292v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on 3D Vision-Language Models (3D-VLMs) is gaining increasing attention, which is crucial for developing embodied AI within 3D scenes, such as visual navigation and embodied question answering. Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefDrone: A Challenging Benchmark for Referring Expression Comprehension in Drone Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00392v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drones have become prevalent robotic platforms with diverse applications, showing significant potential in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI). Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code will be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Action Learning Requires Supervision in the Presence of Distractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00379v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | Preprint.

| **[MINDSTORES: Memory-Informed Neural Decision Synthesis for Task-Oriented Reinforcement in Embodied Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19318v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities as zero-shot planners for embodied agents, their inability to learn from experience and build persistent mental models limits their robustness in complex open-world environments like Minecraft. We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deception in LLMs: Self-Preservation and Autonomous Goals in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16513v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have incorporated planning and reasoning capabilities, enabling models to outline steps before execution and provide transparent reasoning paths. This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions. This highlights the critical need for robust goal specification and safety frameworks before any physical implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected Version - Solved Some Issues with reference compilation by latex</p></details> |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

| **[Efficient and Trustworthy Block Propagation for Blockchain-enabled Mobile Embodied AI Networks: A Graph Resfusion Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09624v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By synergistically integrating mobile networks and embodied artificial intelligence (AI), Mobile Embodied AI Networks (MEANETs) represent an advanced paradigm that facilitates autonomous, context-aware, and interactive behaviors within dynamic environments. Nevertheless, the rapid development of MEANETs is accompanied by challenges in trustworthiness and operational efficiency. Fortunately, blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable characteristics, offers promising solutions for MEANETs. However, existing block propagation mechanisms suffer from challenges such as low propagation efficiency and weak security for block propagation, which results in delayed transmission of vehicular messages or vulnerability to malicious tampering, potentially causing severe traffic accidents in blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Moreover, current block propagation strategies cannot effectively adapt to real-time changes of dynamic topology in MEANETs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph Resfusion model-based trustworthy block propagation optimization framework for consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Specifically, we propose an innovative trust calculation mechanism based on the trust cloud model, which comprehensively accounts for randomness and fuzziness in the miner trust evaluation. Furthermore, by leveraging the strengths of graph neural networks and diffusion models, we develop a graph Resfusion model to effectively and adaptively generate the optimal block propagation trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other routing mechanisms in terms of block propagation efficiency and trustworthiness. Additionally, the results highlight its strong adaptability to dynamic environments, making it particularly suitable for rapidly changing MEANETs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | 58 pages, 11 figures |
| **[SpatialCoT: Advancing Spatial Reasoning through Coordinate Alignment and Chain-of-Thought for Embodied Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10074v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning is an essential problem in embodied AI research. Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[EmbodiedEval: Evaluate Multimodal LLMs as Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11858v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant advancements, providing a promising future for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</p></details> | Website: GenEx.world |

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

However, a standardized, closed-loop benchmark for evaluating their spatial reasoning and sequential decision-making capabilities is lacking. To address this, we present MetaVQA: a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess and enhance VLMs' understanding of spatial relationships and scene dynamics through Visual Question Answering (VQA) and closed-loop simulations. MetaVQA leverages Set-of-Mark prompting and top-down view ground-truth annotations from nuScenes and Waymo datasets to automatically generate extensive question-answer pairs based on diverse real-world traffic scenarios, ensuring object-centric and context-rich instructions. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with the MetaVQA dataset significantly improves their spatial reasoning and embodied scene comprehension in safety-critical simulations, evident not only in improved VQA accuracies but also in emerging safety-aware driving maneuvers. In addition, the learning demonstrates strong transferability from simulation to real-world observation.

However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks. This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context. Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior studies that explored this as long-form video understanding and utilized egocentric video only, we instead propose an LLM-based agent, Embodied VideoAgent, which constructs scene memory from both egocentric video and embodied sensory inputs (e.g. depth and pose sensing). We further introduce a VLM-based approach to automatically update the memory when actions or activities over objects are perceived. Embodied VideoAgent attains significant advantages over counterparts in challenging reasoning and planning tasks in 3D scenes, achieving gains of 4.9% on Ego4D-VQ3D, 5.8% on OpenEQA, and 11.7% on EnvQA.

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |

The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment.

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV.

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</p></details> |  |

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments.

While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/</p></details> |

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |

However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management.

However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task of embodied AI that requires the agent to find a target object in unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging as it demands both perceptual and cognitive processes for effective perception and decision-making. While perception has gained significant progress powered by the rapidly developed visual foundation models, the progress on the cognitive side remains limited to either implicitly learning from massive navigation demonstrations or explicitly leveraging pre-defined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that humans consistently update their cognitive states while searching for objects in unseen environments, we present CogNav, which attempts to model this cognitive process with the help of large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process with a finite state machine composed of cognitive states ranging from exploration to identification. The transitions between the states are determined by a large language model based on an online built heterogeneous cognitive map containing spatial and semantic information of the scene being explored. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world environments demonstrate that our cognitive modeling significantly improves ObjectNav efficiency, with human-like navigation behaviors. In an open-vocabulary and zero-shot setting, our method advances the SOTA of the HM3D benchmark from 69.3% to 87.2%. The code and data will be released.</p></details> |  |

The central case study is Jess+ an intelligent digital score system for shared creativity with a mixed ensemble of non-disabled and disabled musicians. The overarching aim is that the digital score enables disabled musicians to thrive in a live music conversation with other musicians regardless of the potential barriers of disability and music-making. After defining what we mean by embodied AI and how this approach supports the aims of the Jess+ project, we outline the main design features of the system. This includes several novel approaches such as its modular design, an AI Factory based on an embodied musicking dataset, and an embedded belief system. Our findings showed that the implemented design decisions and embodied-AI approach led to rich experiences for the musicians which in turn transformed their practice as an inclusive ensemble.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models in Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07904v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated a wide range of capabilities across many domains, including Embodied AI. In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfiniteWorld: A Unified Scalable Simulation Framework for General Visual-Language Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05789v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realizing scaling laws in embodied AI has become a focus. However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This study finds that state-of-the-art embodied AI agents compete for higher navigation quality, but often compromise the computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce "Skip-SCAR," an optimization framework that builds computationally and memory-efficient embodied AI agents to accomplish high-quality visual navigation tasks. Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint. Tested on the HM3D ObjectNav datasets and real-world physical hardware systems, Skip-SCAR not only minimizes hardware resources but also sets new performance benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of optimizing both navigation quality and computational efficiency for robotics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Privacy Risks in Reinforcement Learning for Household Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09273v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prominence of embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI), which empowers robots to navigate, perceive, and engage within virtual environments, has attracted significant attention, owing to the remarkable advances in computer vision and large language models. Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The system leverages multiple RGB-D cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |

Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

Despite recent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods often lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in scenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this paper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and scalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors and multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion (OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved surfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric fidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital twins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM-based planners are inefficient due to their large number of parameters and prone to inaccuracies because they operate in open-loop systems. We think the reason is that only applying LLMs as planners is insufficient. In this work, we propose DaDu-E, a robust closed-loop planning framework for embodied AI robots. Specifically, DaDu-E is equipped with a relatively lightweight LLM, a set of encapsulated robot skill instructions, a robust feedback system, and memory augmentation. Together, these components enable DaDu-E to (i) actively perceive and adapt to dynamic environments, (ii) optimize computational costs while maintaining high performance, and (iii) recover from execution failures using its memory and feedback mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world and simulated tasks show that DaDu-E achieves task success rates comparable to embodied AI robots with larger models as planners like COME-Robot, while reducing computational requirements by $6.6 \times$.

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters, connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and easy integration with downstream tasks.

| **[Right Place, Right Time! Generalizing ObjectNav to Dynamic Environments with Portable Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09905v2)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ObjectNav is a popular task in Embodied AI, where an agent navigates to a target object in an unseen environment. Prior literature makes the assumption of a static environment with stationary objects, which lacks realism. To address this, we present a novel formulation to generalize ObjectNav to dynamic environments with non-stationary objects, and refer to it as Portable ObjectNav or P-ObjectNav. In our formulation, we first address several challenging issues with dynamizing existing topological scene graphs by developing a novel method that introduces multiple transition behaviors to portable objects in the scene. We use this technique to dynamize Matterport3D, a popular simulator for evaluating embodied tasks. We then present a benchmark for P-ObjectNav using a combination of heuristic, reinforcement learning, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based navigation approaches on the dynamized environment, while introducing novel evaluation metrics tailored for our task. Our work fundamentally challenges the "static-environment" notion of prior ObjectNav work; the code and dataset for P-ObjectNav will be made publicly available to foster research on embodied navigation in dynamic scenes. We provide an anonymized repository for our code and dataset: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PObjectNav-1C6D.</p></details> | 19 |
| **[Learning Reward and Policy Jointly from Demonstration and Preference Improves Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06874v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for building contemporary foundation models and embodied AI. However, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning task. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant under-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward model and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment performance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated Human Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and demonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach admits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and leverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy Optimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment pipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with extensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially when the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.</p></details> |  |

The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EARBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EARDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

Representative artificial neural networks in these fields span convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and deep Q-networks. Built upon unimodal neural networks, numerous multi-modal models have been introduced to address a range of tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and speech recognition. The rise of instruction-following robotic policies in embodied AI has spurred the development of a novel category of multi-modal models known as vision-language-action models (VLAs). Their multi-modality capability has become a foundational element in robot learning. Various methods have been proposed to enhance traits such as versatility, dexterity, and generalizability. Some models focus on refining specific components. Others aim to develop control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. Certain VLAs serve as high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into executable subtasks. Over the past few years, a myriad of VLAs have emerged, reflecting the rapid advancement of embodied AI.

However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downstream tasks. Image-to-video diffusion models are already capable of generating highly realistic synthetic videos. However, these models are not action-conditioned, and the most powerful models are closed-source which means they cannot be finetuned. In this work, we propose to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to action-conditioned world models, without access to the parameters of the pretrained model. Our approach, AVID, trains an adapter on a small domain-specific dataset of action-labelled videos. AVID uses a learned mask to modify the intermediate outputs of the pretrained model and generate accurate action-conditioned videos. We evaluate AVID on video game and real-world robotics data, and show that it outperforms existing baselines for diffusion model adaptation.1 Our results demonstrate that if utilized correctly, pretrained video models have the potential to be powerful tools for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/avid-world-model-adapters/home</p></details> |

In this study, we introduce ROOT, a VLM-based system designed to enhance the analysis of indoor scenes. Specifically, we first develop an iterative object perception algorithm using GPT-4V to detect object entities within indoor scenes. This is followed by employing vision foundation models to acquire additional meta-information about the scene, such as bounding boxes. Building on this foundational data, we propose a specialized VLM, SceneVLM, which is capable of generating spatial hierarchical scene graphs and providing distance information for objects within indoor environments. This information enhances our understanding of the spatial arrangement of indoor scenes. To train our SceneVLM, we collect over 610,000 images from various public indoor datasets and implement a scene data generation pipeline with a semi-automated technique to establish relationships and estimate distances among indoor objects. By utilizing this enriched data, we conduct various training recipes and finish SceneVLM. Our experiments demonstrate that \rootname facilitates indoor scene understanding and proves effective in diverse downstream applications, such as 3D scene generation and embodied AI.

However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs and 3D segmentation masks. In addition, we design MORE3D, a simple yet effective method that enables multi-object 3D reasoning segmentation with user questions and textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation.

A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

| **[Software-Hardware Co-Design For Embodied AI Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04292v4)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI robots have the potential to fundamentally improve the way human beings live and manufacture. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame-basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes Corki, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI robot control. Our idea is to decouple LLM inference, robotic control and data communication in the embodied AI robots compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, Corki predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. Corki largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to 8.0x, resulting in up to 3.6x speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 17.3%. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/hyy0613/Corki</p></details> |  |

Generated models frequently fail to maintain balance when placed in physics-based simulations or 3D printed. This balance is crucial for satisfying user design intentions in interactive gaming, embodied AI, and robotics, where stable models are needed for reliable interaction. Additionally, stable models ensure that 3D-printed objects, such as figurines for home decoration, can stand on their own without requiring additional supports. To fill this gap, we introduce Atlas3D, an automatic and easy-to-implement method that enhances existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D tools. Atlas3D ensures the generation of self-supporting 3D models that adhere to physical laws of stability under gravity, contact, and friction. Our approach combines a novel differentiable simulation-based loss function with physically inspired regularization, serving as either a refinement or a post-processing module for existing frameworks. We verify Atlas3D's efficacy through extensive generation tasks and validate the resulting 3D models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunuoch.github.io/Atlas3D/</p></details> |

Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing Architect, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene. This iterative structure brings the flexibility for our method to generate or refine scenes from various starting points, such as text, floor plans, or pre-arranged environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Models in Vision: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05902v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive modeling has been a huge success in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, \textit{i.e.}, pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the strategy of representation. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multi-faceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multi-modal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: \url{https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey}.</p></details> |  |

Scene Retrieval with Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14565v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interfaces to embodied AI are becoming more ubiquitous in our daily lives. This opens up further opportunities for language-based interaction with embodied agents, such as a user verbally instructing an agent to execute some task in a specific location. For example, "put the bowls back in the cupboard next to the fridge" or "meet me at the intersection under the red sign." As such, we need methods that interface between natural language and map representations of the environment. To this end, we explore the question of whether we can use an open-set natural language query to identify a scene represented by a 3D scene graph. We define this task as "language-based scene-retrieval" and it is closely related to "coarse-localization," but we are instead searching for a match from a collection of disjoint scenes and not necessarily a large-scale continuous map. We present Text2SceneGraphMatcher, a "scene-retrieval" pipeline that learns joint embeddings between text descriptions and scene graphs to determine if they are a match. The code, trained models, and datasets will be made public.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

However, current VLN frameworks often rely on static environments and optimal expert supervision, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation (HA-VLN), extending traditional VLN by incorporating dynamic human activities and relaxing key assumptions. We propose the Human-Aware 3D (HA3D) simulator, which combines dynamic human activities with the Matterport3D dataset, and the Human-Aware Room-to-Room (HA-R2R) dataset, extending R2R with human activity descriptions. To tackle HA-VLN challenges, we present the Expert-Supervised Cross-Modal (VLN-CM) and Non-Expert-Supervised Decision Transformer (VLN-DT) agents, utilizing cross-modal fusion and diverse training strategies for effective navigation in dynamic human environments. A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability. Ultimately, this work provides benchmarks and insights for future research on embodied AI and Sim2Real transfer, paving the way for more realistic and applicable VLN systems in human-populated environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight at NeurIPS 2024 D&B Track. 32 pages, 18 figures, Project Page: https://lpercc.github.io/HA3D_simulator/</p></details> |

Our system is modular: it deploys state of the art Large Language Models for task planning,Vision-Language models for semantic perception, and Point Cloud transformers for grasping. With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities. One may also in-place swap modules to improve the robustness of the overall platform, for instance with imitation-learned policies.

At present, many evaluation platforms with rich scenes, high visual fidelity and various application scenarios have been developed. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework named NeuronsGym that can be used for policy learning of robot tasks, covering a simulation platform for training policy, and a physical system for studying sim2real problems. Unlike most current single-task, slow-moving robotic platforms, our framework provides agile physical robots with a wider range of speeds, and can be employed to train robotic navigation and confrontation policies. At the same time, in order to evaluate the safety of robot navigation, we propose a safety-weighted path length (SFPL) to improve the safety evaluation in the current mobile robot navigation. Based on this platform, we build a new benchmark for navigation and confrontation tasks under this platform by comparing the current mainstream sim2real methods, and hold the 2022 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) RoboMaster sim2real challenge. We release the codes of this framework\footnote{\url{https://github.com/DRL-CASIA/NeuronsGym}} and hope that this platform can promote the development of more flexible and agile general mobile agent algorithms.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[EnvBridge: Bridging Diverse Environments with Cross-Environment Knowledge Transfer for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16919v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated high reasoning capabilities, drawing attention for their applications as agents in various decision-making processes. One notably promising application of LLM agents is robotic manipulation. Recent research has shown that LLMs can generate text planning or control code for robots, providing substantial flexibility and interaction capabilities. However, these methods still face challenges in terms of flexibility and applicability across different environments, limiting their ability to adapt autonomously. Current approaches typically fall into two categories: those relying on environment-specific policy training, which restricts their transferability, and those generating code actions based on fixed prompts, which leads to diminished performance when confronted with new environments. These limitations significantly constrain the generalizability of agents in robotic manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called EnvBridge. This approach involves the retention and transfer of successful robot control codes from source environments to target environments. EnvBridge enhances the agent's adaptability and performance across diverse settings by leveraging insights from multiple environments. Notably, our approach alleviates environmental constraints, offering a more flexible and generalizable solution for robotic manipulation tasks. We validated the effectiveness of our method using robotic manipulation benchmarks: RLBench, MetaWorld, and CALVIN. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully leverage diverse knowledge sources to solve complex tasks. Consequently, our approach significantly enhances the adaptability and robustness of robotic manipulation agents in planning across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

When integrated into an embodied agent, existing embodied VLM works either output detailed action sequences at the manipulation level or only provide plans at an abstract level, leaving a gap between high-level planning and real-world manipulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octopus, an embodied vision-language programmer that uses executable code generation as a medium to connect planning and manipulation. Octopus is designed to 1) proficiently comprehend an agent's visual and textual task objectives, 2) formulate intricate action sequences, and 3) generate executable code. To facilitate Octopus model development, we introduce OctoVerse: a suite of environments tailored for benchmarking vision-based code generators on a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games such as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Minecraft. To train Octopus, we leverage GPT-4 to control an explorative agent that generates training data, i.e., action blueprints and corresponding executable code. We also collect feedback that enables an enhanced training scheme called Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate Octopus's functionality and present compelling results, showing that the proposed RLEF refines the agent's decision-making. By open-sourcing our simulation environments, dataset, and model architecture, we aspire to ignite further innovation and foster collaborative applications within the broader embodied AI community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://choiszt.github.io/Octopus/, Codebase: https://github.com/dongyh20/Octopus</p></details> |

More recently, multi-agent systems with LLM-based agents (Multi-LLM) have been utilized increasingly more for QA. In these scenarios, the models may each answer the question and reach a consensus or each model is specialized to answer different domain questions. However, most prior work dealing with Multi-LLM QA has focused on scenarios where the models are asked in a zero-shot manner or are given information sources to extract the answer. For question answering of an unknown environment, embodied exploration of the environment is first needed to answer the question. This skill is necessary for personalizing embodied AI to environments such as households. There is a lack of insight into whether a Multi-LLM system can handle question-answering based on observations from embodied exploration. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the use of Multi-Embodied LLM Explorers (MELE) for QA in an unknown environment. Multiple LLM-based agents independently explore and then answer queries about a household environment. We analyze different aggregation methods to generate a single, final answer for each query: debating, majority voting, and training a central answer module (CAM). Using CAM, we observe a $46\%$ higher accuracy compared against the other non-learning-based aggregation methods. We provide code and the query dataset for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Through this unified latent action space, IGOR enables knowledge transfer among large-scale robot and human activity data. We achieve this by compressing visual changes between an initial image and its goal state into latent actions. IGOR allows us to generate latent action labels for internet-scale video data. This unified latent action space enables the training of foundation policy and world models across a wide variety of tasks performed by both robots and humans. We demonstrate that: (1) IGOR learns a semantically consistent action space for both human and robots, characterizing various possible motions of objects representing the physical interaction knowledge; (2) IGOR can "migrate" the movements of the object in the one video to other videos, even across human and robots, by jointly using the latent action model and world model; (3) IGOR can learn to align latent actions with natural language through the foundation policy model, and integrate latent actions with a low-level policy model to achieve effective robot control. We believe IGOR opens new possibilities for human-to-robot knowledge transfer and control.</p></details> |  |

Building on previous work, EgoThink, we introduce VidEgoThink, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating egocentric video understanding capabilities. To bridge the gap between MLLMs and low-level control in Embodied AI, we design four key interrelated tasks: video question-answering, hierarchy planning, visual grounding and reward modeling. To minimize manual annotation costs, we develop an automatic data generation pipeline based on the Ego4D dataset, leveraging the prior knowledge and multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o. Three human annotators then filter the generated data to ensure diversity and quality, resulting in the VidEgoThink benchmark. We conduct extensive experiments with three types of models: API-based MLLMs, open-source image-based MLLMs, and open-source video-based MLLMs. Experimental results indicate that all MLLMs, including GPT-4o, perform poorly across all tasks related to egocentric video understanding. These findings suggest that foundation models still require significant advancements to be effectively applied to first-person scenarios in Embodied AI. In conclusion, VidEgoThink reflects a research trend towards employing MLLMs for egocentric vision, akin to human capabilities, enabling active observation and interaction in the complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation-a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation-remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.</p></details> |  |

For the egocentric HOI, in addition to perceiving semantics e.g., ''what'' interaction is occurring, capturing ''where'' the interaction specifically manifests in 3D space is also crucial, which links the perception and operation. Existing methods primarily leverage observations of HOI to capture interaction regions from an exocentric view. However, incomplete observations of interacting parties in the egocentric view introduce ambiguity between visual observations and interaction contents, impairing their efficacy. From the egocentric view, humans integrate the visual cortex, cerebellum, and brain to internalize their intentions and interaction concepts of objects, allowing for the pre-formulation of interactions and making behaviors even when interaction regions are out of sight. In light of this, we propose harmonizing the visual appearance, head motion, and 3D object to excavate the object interaction concept and subject intention, jointly inferring 3D human contact and object affordance from egocentric videos. To achieve this, we present EgoChoir, which links object structures with interaction contexts inherent in appearance and head motion to reveal object affordance, further utilizing it to model human contact. Additionally, a gradient modulation is employed to adopt appropriate clues for capturing interaction regions across various egocentric scenarios. Moreover, 3D contact and affordance are annotated for egocentric videos collected from Ego-Exo4D and GIMO to support the task. Extensive experiments on them demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of EgoChoir.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2024, project: https://yyvhang.github.io/EgoChoir/</p></details> |

Accomplishing this goal requires learning to ground language in perception and embodied actions, in order to accomplish complex tasks. The Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project tackles this by training agents to follow free-form instructions across a diverse range of virtual 3D environments, including curated research environments as well as open-ended, commercial video games. Our goal is to develop an instructable agent that can accomplish anything a human can do in any simulated 3D environment. Our approach focuses on language-driven generality while imposing minimal assumptions. Our agents interact with environments in real-time using a generic, human-like interface: the inputs are image observations and language instructions and the outputs are keyboard-and-mouse actions. This general approach is challenging, but it allows agents to ground language across many visually complex and semantically rich environments while also allowing us to readily run agents in new environments. In this paper we describe our motivation and goal, the initial progress we have made, and promising preliminary results on several diverse research environments and a variety of commercial video games.</p></details> |  |

Micromobility enabled by AI for short-distance travel in public urban spaces plays a crucial component in the future transportation system. Ensuring the generalizability and safety of AI models maneuvering mobile machines is essential. In this work, we present MetaUrban, a compositional simulation platform for the AI-driven urban micromobility research. MetaUrban can construct an infinite number of interactive urban scenes from compositional elements, covering a vast array of ground plans, object placements, pedestrians, vulnerable road users, and other mobile agents' appearances and dynamics. We design point navigation and social navigation tasks as the pilot study using MetaUrban for urban micromobility research and establish various baselines of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. We conduct extensive evaluation across mobile machines, demonstrating that heterogeneous mechanical structures significantly influence the learning and execution of AI policies. We perform a thorough ablation study, showing that the compositional nature of the simulated environments can substantially improve the generalizability and safety of the trained mobile agents. MetaUrban will be made publicly available to provide research opportunities and foster safe and trustworthy embodied AI and micromobility in cities. The code and dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report. Project page: https://metadriverse.github.io/metaurban/</p></details> |

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

Hand motion models with the sophistication to accurately recreate piano playing have a wide range of applications in character animation, embodied AI, biomechanics, and VR/AR. In this paper, we construct a first-of-its-kind large-scale dataset that contains approximately 10 hours of 3D hand motion and audio from 15 elite-level pianists playing 153 pieces of classical music. To capture natural performances, we designed a markerless setup in which motions are reconstructed from multi-view videos using state-of-the-art pose estimation models. The motion data is further refined via inverse kinematics using the high-resolution MIDI key-pressing data obtained from sensors in a specialized Yamaha Disklavier piano. Leveraging the collected dataset, we developed a pipeline that can synthesize physically-plausible hand motions for musical scores outside of the dataset. Our approach employs a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning to obtain policies for physics-based bimanual control involving the interaction between hands and piano keys. To solve the sampling efficiency problem with the large motion dataset, we use a diffusion model to generate natural reference motions, which provide high-level trajectory and fingering (finger order and placement) information. However, the generated reference motion alone does not provide sufficient accuracy for piano performance modeling. We then further augmented the data by using musical similarity to retrieve similar motions from the captured dataset to boost the precision of the RL policy. With the proposed method, our model generates natural, dexterous motions that generalize to music from outside the training dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2024.

| **[Learning the Generalizable Manipulation Skills on Soft-body Tasks via Guided Self-attention Behavior Cloning Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05756v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI represents a paradigm in AI research where artificial agents are situated within and interact with physical or virtual environments. Despite the recent progress in Embodied AI, it is still very challenging to learn the generalizable manipulation skills that can handle large deformation and topological changes on soft-body objects, such as clay, water, and soil. In this work, we proposed an effective policy, namely GP2E behavior cloning policy, which can guide the agent to learn the generalizable manipulation skills from soft-body tasks, including pouring, filling, hanging, excavating, pinching, and writing. Concretely, we build our policy from three insights:(1) Extracting intricate semantic features from point cloud data and seamlessly integrating them into the robot's end-effector frame; (2) Capturing long-distance interactions in long-horizon tasks through the incorporation of our guided self-attention module; (3) Mitigating overfitting concerns and facilitating model convergence to higher accuracy levels via the introduction of our two-stage fine-tuning strategy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving the 1st prize in the soft-body track of the ManiSkill2 Challenge at the CVPR 2023 4th Embodied AI workshop. Our findings highlight the potential of our method to improve the generalization abilities of Embodied AI models and pave the way for their practical applications in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-Aware Transformer Networks for Robotic Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02669v2)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research in Visual Navigation reveals opportunities for improvement. First, the direct adoption of RNNs and Transformers often overlooks the specific differences between Embodied AI and traditional sequential data modelling, potentially limiting its performance in Embodied AI tasks. Second, the reliance on task-specific configurations, such as pre-trained modules and dataset-specific logic, compromises the generalizability of these methods. We address these constraints by initially exploring the unique differences between Navigation tasks and other sequential data tasks through the lens of Causality, presenting a causal framework to elucidate the inadequacies of conventional sequential methods for Navigation. By leveraging this causal perspective, we propose Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) Networks for Navigation, featuring a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the models's Environmental Understanding capability. Meanwhile, our method is devoid of task-specific inductive biases and can be trained in an End-to-End manner, which enhances the method's generalizability across various contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology consistently surpasses benchmark performances across a spectrum of settings, tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablation studies reveal that the performance gains can be attributed to the Causal Understanding Module, which demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in both Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning settings.</p></details> |  |

Exploring Backdoor Attacks against Embodied LLM-based Decision-Making Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20774v2)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in real-world decision-making tasks for embodied artificial intelligence, especially when fine-tuned to leverage their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities while being tailored to specific applications. However, this fine-tuning process introduces considerable safety and security vulnerabilities, especially in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-based Decision-making systems (BALD) in embodied AI, systematically exploring the attack surfaces and trigger mechanisms. Specifically, we propose three distinct attack mechanisms: word injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection, targeting various components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline. We perform extensive experiments on representative LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2) in autonomous driving and home robot tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and stealthiness of our backdoor triggers across various attack channels, with cases like vehicles accelerating toward obstacles and robots placing knives on beds. Our word and knowledge injection attacks achieve nearly 100% success rate across multiple models and datasets while requiring only limited access to the system. Our scenario manipulation attack yields success rates exceeding 65%, reaching up to 90%, and does not require any runtime system intrusion. We also assess the robustness of these attacks against defenses, revealing their resilience. Our findings highlight critical security vulnerabilities in embodied LLM systems and emphasize the urgent need for safeguarding these systems to mitigate potential risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, including main paper, references, and appendix</p></details> |

However, there is still lack of study on how vision language models~(VLMs) behave when multi-modal task inputs are considered. Counterfactual planning that evaluates the model's reasoning ability over alternative task situations are also under exploited. In order to evaluate the planning ability of both multi-modal and counterfactual aspects, we propose ActPlan-1K. ActPlan-1K is a multi-modal planning benchmark constructed based on ChatGPT and household activity simulator iGibson2. The benchmark consists of 153 activities and 1,187 instances. Each instance describing one activity has a natural language task description and multiple environment images from the simulator. The gold plan of each instance is action sequences over the objects in provided scenes. Both the correctness and commonsense satisfaction are evaluated on typical VLMs. It turns out that current VLMs are still struggling at generating human-level procedural plans for both normal activities and counterfactual activities. We further provide automatic evaluation metrics by finetuning over BLEURT model to facilitate future research on our benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables, accepted to EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

With the advancement of embodied AI, robots are increasingly capable of satisfying human demands. Demand-driven navigation (DDN) is a task in which an agent must locate an object to satisfy a specified demand instruction, such as ``I am thirsty.'' The previous study typically assumes that each demand instruction requires only one object to be fulfilled and does not consider individual preferences. However, the realistic human demand may involve multiple objects. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-object Demand-driven Navigation (MO-DDN) benchmark, which addresses these nuanced aspects, including multi-object search and personal preferences, thus making the MO-DDN task more reflective of real-life scenarios compared to DDN. Building upon previous work, we employ the concept of ``attribute'' to tackle this new task. However, instead of solely relying on attribute features in an end-to-end manner like DDN, we propose a modular method that involves constructing a coarse-to-fine attribute-based exploration agent (C2FAgent). Our experimental results illustrate that this coarse-to-fine exploration strategy capitalizes on the advantages of attributes at various decision-making levels, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods.

This work investigates the key challenges in applying reinforcement learning to solve a collection of contact-rich manipulation tasks on a humanoid embodiment. We introduce novel techniques to overcome the identified challenges with empirical validation. Our main contributions include an automated real-to-sim tuning module that brings the simulated environment closer to the real world, a generalized reward design scheme that simplifies reward engineering for long-horizon contact-rich manipulation tasks, a divide-and-conquer distillation process that improves the sample efficiency of hard-exploration problems while maintaining sim-to-real performance, and a mixture of sparse and dense object representations to bridge the sim-to-real perception gap. We show promising results on three humanoid dexterous manipulation tasks, with ablation studies on each technique. Our work presents a successful approach to learning humanoid dexterous manipulation using sim-to-real reinforcement learning, achieving robust generalization and high performance without the need for human demonstration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page can be found at https://toruowo.github.io/recipe/</p></details> |

Existing methods either generate code without feedback or use complex, hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize multi-turn rewards. We propose a simple yet scalable approach, $\mu$Code, that solves multi-turn code generation using only single-step rewards. Our key insight is that code generation is a one-step recoverable MDP, where the correct code can be recovered from any intermediate code state in a single turn. $\mu$Code iteratively trains both a generator to provide code solutions conditioned on multi-turn execution feedback and a verifier to score the newly generated code. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines. We provide analysis of the design choices of the reward models and policy, and show the efficacy of $\mu$Code at utilizing the execution feedback.

In recent works, the use of large datasets and supervised learning has enhanced speed and precision in antipodal grasping. However, these methods struggle with perception and calibration errors due to large planning horizons. To obtain more robust and reactive grasping motions, leveraging reinforcement learning combined with tactile sensing is a promising direction. Yet, there is no systematic evaluation of how the complexity of force-based tactile sensing affects the learning behavior for grasping tasks. This paper compares various tactile and environmental setups using two model-free reinforcement learning approaches for antipodal grasping. Our findings suggest that under imperfect visual perception, various tactile features improve learning outcomes, while complex tactile inputs complicate training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Efficiency of a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Power Management System for HPC Clusters Using Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20348v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High energy consumption remains a key challenge in high-performance computing (HPC) systems, which often feature hundreds or thousands of nodes drawing substantial power even in idle or standby modes. Although powering down unused nodes can improve energy efficiency, choosing the wrong time to do so can degrade quality of service by delaying job execution. Machine learning, in particular reinforcement learning (RL), has shown promise in determining optimal times to switch nodes on or off. In this study, we enhance the performance of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent for HPC power management by integrating curriculum learning (CL), a training approach that introduces tasks with gradually increasing difficulty. Using the Batsim-py simulation framework, we compare the proposed CL-based agent to both a baseline DRL method (without CL) and the conventional fixed-time timeout strategy. Experimental results confirm that an easy-to-hard curriculum outperforms other training orders in terms of reducing wasted energy usage. The best agent achieves a 3.73% energy reduction over the baseline DRL method and a 4.66% improvement compared to the best timeout configuration (shutdown every 15 minutes of idle time). In addition, it reduces average job waiting time by 9.24% and maintains a higher job-filling rate, indicating more effective resource utilization. Sensitivity tests across various switch-on durations, power levels, and cluster sizes further reveal the agent's adaptability to changing system parameters without retraining. These findings demonstrate that curriculum learning can significantly improve DRL-based power management in HPC, balancing energy savings, quality of service, and robustness to diverse configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 17 figures, accepted at Supercomputing Asia '25, published by ACM</p></details> |
| **[Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20341v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning algorithms typically necessitate extensive exploration of the state space to find optimal policies. However, in safety-critical applications, the risks associated with such exploration can lead to catastrophic consequences. Existing safe exploration methods attempt to mitigate this by imposing constraints, which often result in overly conservative behaviours and inefficient learning. Heavy penalties for early constraint violations can trap agents in local optima, deterring exploration of risky yet high-reward regions of the state space. To address this, we introduce a method that explicitly learns state-conditioned safety representations. By augmenting the state features with these safety representations, our approach naturally encourages safer exploration without being excessively cautious, resulting in more efficient and safer policy learning in safety-critical scenarios. Empirical evaluations across diverse environments show that our method significantly improves task performance while reducing constraint violations during training, underscoring its effectiveness in balancing exploration with safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning based Autonomous Decision-Making for Cooperative UAVs: A Search and Rescue Real World Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20326v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a holistic framework for autonomous guidance, navigation, and task distribution among multi-drone systems operating in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied indoor settings. We advocate for a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based guidance mechanism, utilising the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. To improve the efficiency of the training process, we incorporate an Artificial Potential Field (APF)-based reward structure, enabling the agent to refine its movements, thereby promoting smoother paths and enhanced obstacle avoidance in indoor contexts. Furthermore, we tackle the issue of task distribution among cooperative UAVs through a DRL-trained Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). This GCN represents the interactions between drones and tasks, facilitating dynamic and real-time task allocation that reflects the current environmental conditions and the capabilities of the drones. Such an approach fosters effective coordination and collaboration among multiple drones during search and rescue operations or other exploratory endeavours. Lastly, to ensure precise odometry in environments lacking GNSS, we employ Light Detection And Ranging Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping complemented by a depth camera to mitigate the hallway problem. This integration offers robust localisation and mapping functionalities, thereby enhancing the systems dependability in indoor navigation. The proposed multi-drone framework not only elevates individual navigation capabilities but also optimises coordinated task allocation in complex, obstacle-laden environments. Experimental evaluations conducted in a setup tailored to meet the requirements of the NATO Sapience Autonomous Cooperative Drone Competition demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system, yielding outstanding results and culminating in a first-place finish in the 2024 Sapience competition.</p></details> | 18 Pages, 21 Figures |
| **[Soft-QMIX: Integrating Maximum Entropy For Monotonic Value Function Factorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13930v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks often utilize a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework. QMIX is a successful CTDE method that learns a credit assignment function to derive local value functions from a global value function, defining a deterministic local policy. However, QMIX is hindered by its poor exploration strategy. While maximum entropy reinforcement learning (RL) promotes better exploration through stochastic policies, QMIX's process of credit assignment conflicts with the maximum entropy objective and the decentralized execution requirement, making it unsuitable for maximum entropy RL. In this paper, we propose an enhancement to QMIX by incorporating an additional local Q-value learning method within the maximum entropy RL framework. Our approach constrains the local Q-value estimates to maintain the correct ordering of all actions. Due to the monotonicity of the QMIX value function, these updates ensure that locally optimal actions align with globally optimal actions. We theoretically prove the monotonic improvement and convergence of our method to an optimal solution. Experimentally, we validate our algorithm in matrix games, Multi-Agent Particle Environment and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in SMAC-v2.</p></details> |  |

Numerous studies have leveraged the robustness of decision-making in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address the optimization challenges associated with algorithm configuration. However, making an RL agent work properly is a non-trivial task, especially in reward design, which necessitates a substantial amount of handcrafted knowledge based on domain expertise. In this work, we study the importance of reward design in the context of DAC via a case study on controlling the population size of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$-GA optimizing OneMax. We observed that a poorly designed reward can hinder the RL agent's ability to learn an optimal policy because of a lack of exploration, leading to both scalability and learning divergence issues. To address those challenges, we propose the application of a reward shaping mechanism to facilitate enhanced exploration of the environment by the RL agent. Our work not only demonstrates the ability of RL in dynamically configuring the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$-GA, but also confirms the advantages of reward shaping in the scalability of RL agents across various sizes of OneMax problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Latent Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13755v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Random Latent Exploration (RLE), a simple yet effective exploration strategy in reinforcement learning (RL). On average, RLE outperforms noise-based methods, which perturb the agent's actions, and bonus-based exploration, which rewards the agent for attempting novel behaviors. The core idea of RLE is to encourage the agent to explore different parts of the environment by pursuing randomly sampled goals in a latent space. RLE is as simple as noise-based methods, as it avoids complex bonus calculations but retains the deep exploration benefits of bonus-based methods. Our experiments show that RLE improves performance on average in both discrete (e.g., Atari) and continuous control tasks (e.g., Isaac Gym), enhancing exploration while remaining a simple and general plug-in for existing RL algorithms.

| **[Leveraging Graph Neural Networks and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Inventory Control in Supply Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18631v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inventory control in modern supply chains has attracted significant attention due to the increasing number of disruptive shocks and the challenges posed by complex dynamics, uncertainties, and limited collaboration. Traditional methods, which often rely on static parameters, struggle to adapt to changing environments. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for state representation to address these limitations. Our approach redefines the action space by parameterizing heuristic inventory control policies, making it adaptive as the parameters dynamically adjust based on system conditions. By leveraging the inherent graph structure of supply chains, our framework enables agents to learn the system's topology, and we employ a centralized learning, decentralized execution scheme that allows agents to learn collaboratively while overcoming information-sharing constraints. Additionally, we incorporate global mean pooling and regularization techniques to enhance performance. We test the capabilities of our proposed approach on four different supply chain configurations and conduct a sensitivity analysis. This work paves the way for utilizing MARL-GNN frameworks to improve inventory management in complex, decentralized supply chain environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARVEL: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for constrained field-of-View multi-robot Exploration in Large-scale environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20217v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-robot exploration, a team of mobile robot is tasked with efficiently mapping an unknown environments. While most exploration planners assume omnidirectional sensors like LiDAR, this is impractical for small robots such as drones, where lightweight, directional sensors like cameras may be the only option due to payload constraints. These sensors have a constrained field-of-view (FoV), which adds complexity to the exploration problem, requiring not only optimal robot positioning but also sensor orientation during movement. In this work, we propose MARVEL, a neural framework that leverages graph attention networks, together with novel frontiers and orientation features fusion technique, to develop a collaborative, decentralized policy using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for robots with constrained FoV. To handle the large action space of viewpoints planning, we further introduce a novel information-driven action pruning strategy. MARVEL improves multi-robot coordination and decision-making in challenging large-scale indoor environments, while adapting to various team sizes and sensor configurations (i.e., FoV and sensor range) without additional training. Our extensive evaluation shows that MARVEL's learned policies exhibit effective coordinated behaviors, outperforming state-of-the-art exploration planners across multiple metrics. We experimentally demonstrate MARVEL's generalizability in large-scale environments, of up to 90m by 90m, and validate its practical applicability through successful deployment on a team of real drone hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 20XX IEEE.

| **[Highly Parallelized Reinforcement Learning Training with Relaxed Assignment Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20190v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the demands for superior agents grow, the training complexity of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) becomes higher. Thus, accelerating training of DRL has become a major research focus. Dividing the DRL training process into subtasks and using parallel computation can effectively reduce training costs. However, current DRL training systems lack sufficient parallelization due to data assignment between subtask components. This assignment issue has been ignored, but addressing it can further boost training efficiency. Therefore, we propose a high-throughput distributed RL training system called TianJi. It relaxes assignment dependencies between subtask components and enables event-driven asynchronous communication. Meanwhile, TianJi maintains clear boundaries between subtask components. To address convergence uncertainty from relaxed assignment dependencies, TianJi proposes a distributed strategy based on the balance of sample production and consumption. The strategy controls the staleness of samples to correct their quality, ensuring convergence. We conducted extensive experiments. TianJi achieves a convergence time acceleration ratio of up to 4.37 compared to related comparison systems. When scaled to eight computational nodes, TianJi shows a convergence time speedup of 1.6 and a throughput speedup of 7.13 relative to XingTian, demonstrating its capability to accelerate training and scalability. In data transmission efficiency experiments, TianJi significantly outperforms other systems, approaching hardware limits. TianJi also shows effectiveness in on-policy algorithms, achieving convergence time acceleration ratios of 4.36 and 2.95 compared to RLlib and XingTian. TianJi is accessible at https://github.com/HiPRL/TianJi.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with State-Space World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20168v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for robot learning. However, model-free RL (MFRL) requires a large number of environment interactions to learn successful control policies. This is due to the noisy RL training updates and the complexity of robotic systems, which typically involve highly non-linear dynamics and noisy sensor signals. In contrast, model-based RL (MBRL) not only trains a policy but simultaneously learns a world model that captures the environment's dynamics and rewards. The world model can either be used for planning, for data collection, or to provide first-order policy gradients for training. Leveraging a world model significantly improves sample efficiency compared to model-free RL. However, training a world model alongside the policy increases the computational complexity, leading to longer training times that are often intractable for complex real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a new method for accelerating model-based RL using state-space world models. Our approach leverages state-space models (SSMs) to parallelize the training of the dynamics model, which is typically the main computational bottleneck. Additionally, we propose an architecture that provides privileged information to the world model during training, which is particularly relevant for partially observable environments. We evaluate our method in several real-world agile quadrotor flight tasks, involving complex dynamics, for both fully and partially observable environments. We demonstrate a significant speedup, reducing the world model training time by up to 10 times, and the overall MBRL training time by up to 4 times. This benefit comes without compromising performance, as our method achieves similar sample efficiency and task rewards to state-of-the-art MBRL methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing training approaches for issue resolving struggle with poor generalization and fail to fully leverage open-source development resources. We propose Subtask-oriented Reinforced Fine-Tuning (SoRFT), a novel training approach to enhance the issue resolving capability of LLMs. We decomposes issue resolving into structured subtasks: file localization, function localization, line localization, and code edit generation. SoRFT consists of two training stages: (1) rejection-sampled supervised fine-tuning, Chain of Thought (CoT) data is filtered using ground-truth before fine-tuning the LLM, and (2) rule-based reinforcement learning, which leverages PPO with ground-truth based rewards. We evaluate the SoRFT-trained model on SWE-Bench Verified and SWE-Bench Lite, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source models (e.g., resolve 21.4% issues on SWE-Bench Verified with SoRFT-Qwen-7B). The experimental results demonstrate that SoRFT significantly enhances issue-resolving performance, improves model generalization, and provides a cost-efficient alternative to commercial models.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Generative Model Enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Method for Electric Vehicle Charging Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20068v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), navigating for EV drivers to select a cost-effective charging station has become an important yet challenging issue due to dynamic traffic conditions, fluctuating electricity prices, and potential competition from other EVs. The state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms for solving this task still require global information about all EVs at the execution stage, which not only increases communication costs but also raises privacy issues among EV drivers. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce a novel generative model-enhanced multi-agent DRL algorithm that utilizes only the EV's local information while achieving performance comparable to these state-of-the-art algorithms. Specifically, the policy network is implemented on the EV side, and a Conditional Variational Autoencoder-Long Short Term Memory (CVAE-LSTM)-based recommendation model is developed to provide recommendation information. Furthermore, a novel future charging competition encoder is designed to effectively compress global information, enhancing training performance. The multi-gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) is also utilized to adaptively balance the weight between the two parts of the training objective, resulting in a more stable training process. Simulations are conducted based on a practical area in Xi\'an, China. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm, which relies on local information, outperforms existing local information-based methods and achieves less than 8\% performance loss compared to global information-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Conventional control methodologies are often inadequate in addressing the complexities associated with high-dimensional dynamics and the contact-rich nature of fall recovery. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning techniques are hindered by issues related to sparse rewards, intricate collision scenarios, and discrepancies between simulation and real-world applications. In this study, we introduce a multi-stage curriculum learning framework, termed HiFAR. This framework employs a staged learning approach that progressively incorporates increasingly complex and high-dimensional recovery tasks, thereby facilitating the robot's acquisition of efficient and stable fall recovery strategies. Furthermore, it enables the robot to adapt its policy to effectively manage real-world fall incidents. We assess the efficacy of the proposed method using a real humanoid robot, showcasing its capability to autonomously recover from a diverse range of falls with high success rates, rapid recovery times, robustness, and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning via Inverse Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20030v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the recent successes of Inverse Optimization (IO) across various application domains, we propose a novel offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) algorithm for continuous state and action spaces, leveraging the convex loss function called ``sub-optimality loss" from the IO literature. To mitigate the distribution shift commonly observed in ORL problems, we further employ a robust and non-causal Model Predictive Control (MPC) expert steering a nominal model of the dynamics using in-hindsight information stemming from the model mismatch. Unlike the existing literature, our robust MPC expert enjoys an exact and tractable convex reformulation. In the second part of this study, we show that the IO hypothesis class, trained by the proposed convex loss function, enjoys ample expressiveness and achieves competitive performance comparing with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the low-data regime of the MuJoCo benchmark while utilizing three orders of magnitude fewer parameters, thereby requiring significantly fewer computational resources. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we provide an open-source package implementing the proposed algorithms and the experiments.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Robust Mean Field Social Control: A Unified Reinforcement Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20029v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies linear quadratic Gaussian robust mean field social control problems in the presence of multiplicative noise. We aim to compute asymptotic decentralized strategies without requiring full prior knowledge of agents' dynamics. The primary challenges lie in solving an indefinite stochastic algebraic Riccati equation for feedback gains, and an indefinite algebraic Riccati equation for feedforward gains. To overcome these challenges, we first propose a unified dual-loop iterative framework that simultaneously handles both indefinite Riccati-type equations, and provide rigorous convergence proofs for both outer-loop and inner-loop iterations. Second, recognizing that biases may arise in iterative processes due to estimation and modeling errors, we analyze the robustness of the proposed algorithm by using the small-disturbance input-to-state stability technique. This ensures convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, even in the existence of disturbances. Finally, to address the limitation of requiring precise knowledge of agents' dynamics, we employ the integral reinforcement learning technique to develop a data-driven method within the dual-loop iterative framework. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Mean Field Equilibrium Computation in Large-Population LQG Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19993v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel data-driven approach for approximating the $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in continuous-time linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) games, where multiple agents interact with each other through their dynamics and infinite horizon discounted costs. The core of our method involves solving two algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) and an ordinary differential equation (ODE) using state and input samples collected from agents, eliminating the need for a priori knowledge of their dynamical models. The standard ARE is addressed through an integral reinforcement learning (IRL) technique, while the nonsymmetric ARE and the ODE are resolved by identifying the drift coefficients of the agents' dynamics under general conditions. Moreover, by imposing specific conditions on models, we extend the IRL-based approach to approximately solve the nonsymmetric ARE. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergence Guarantees of Model-free Policy Gradient Methods for LQR with Stochastic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19977v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy gradient (PG) methods are the backbone of many reinforcement learning algorithms due to their good performance in policy optimization problems. As a gradient-based approach, PG methods typically rely on knowledge of the system dynamics. However, this information is not always available, and in such cases, trajectory data can be utilized to approximate first-order information. When the data are noisy, gradient estimates become inaccurate and a formal investigation that encompasses uncertainty estimation and the analysis of its propagation through the algorithm is currently missing. To address this, our work focuses on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem for systems subject to additive stochastic noise. After briefly summarizing the state of the art for cases with a known model, we focus on scenarios where the system dynamics are unknown, and approximate gradient information is obtained using zeroth-order optimization techniques. We analyze the theoretical properties by computing the error in the estimated gradient and examining how this error affects the convergence of PG algorithms. Additionally, we provide global convergence guarantees for various versions of PG methods, including those employing adaptive step sizes and variance reduction techniques, which help increase the convergence rate and reduce sample complexity. One contribution of this work is the study of the robustness of model-free PG methods, aiming to identify their limitations in the presence of noise and propose improvements to enhance their applicability. Numerical simulations show that these theoretical analyses provide valuable guidance in tuning the algorithm parameters, thereby making these methods more reliable in practically relevant scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SIAM Control and Optimization</p></details> |
| **[Deep Incremental Model Informed Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Robotic Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01529v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning attempts to use an available or learned model to improve the data efficiency of reinforcement learning. This work proposes a one-step lookback approach that jointly learns the deep incremental model and the policy to realize the sample-efficient continuous robotic control, wherein the control-theoretical knowledge is utilized to decrease the model learning difficulty and facilitate efficient training. Specifically, we use one-step backward data to facilitate the deep incremental model, an alternative structured representation of the robotic evolution model, that accurately predicts the robotic movement but with low sample complexity. This is because the formulated deep incremental model degrades the model learning difficulty into a parametric matrix learning problem, which is especially favourable to high-dimensional robotic applications. The imagined data from the learned deep incremental model is used to supplement training data to enhance the sample efficiency. Comparative numerical simulations on benchmark continuous robotics control problems are conducted to validate the efficiency of our proposed one-step lookback approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[What is the Alignment Objective of GRPO?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18548v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this note, we examine the aggregation of preferences achieved by the Group Policy Optimisation (GRPO) algorithm, a reinforcement learning method used to train advanced artificial intelligence models such as DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeekMath. The GRPO algorithm trains a policy using a reward preference model, which is computed by sampling a set of outputs for a given context, observing the corresponding rewards, and applying shift-and-scale normalisation to these reward values. Additionally, it incorporates a penalty function to discourage deviations from a reference policy. We present a framework that enables us to characterise the stationary policies of the GRPO algorithm. This analysis reveals that the aggregation of preferences differs fundamentally from standard logarithmic pooling, which is implemented by other approaches such as RLHF. The precise form of preference aggregation arises from the way the reward preference model is defined and from the penalty function, which we show to essentially correspond to the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the aggregation policy and the reference policy. Interestingly, we demonstrate that for groups of size two, the reward preference model corresponds to pairwise comparison preferences, similar to those in other alignment methods based on pairwise comparison feedback. We provide explicit characterisations of the aggregate preference for binary questions, for groups of size two, and in the limit of large group size. This provides insights into the dependence of the aggregate preference on parameters such as the regularisation constant and the confidence margin of question answers. Finally, we discuss the aggregation of preferences obtained by modifying the GRPO algorithm to use direct KL divergence as the penalty or to use rewards without scale normalisation.</p></details> |  |

While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

To address these challenges, this study proposes the ColorDynamic framework. First, an end-to-end DRL formulation is established, which maps raw sensor data directly to control commands, thereby ensuring compatibility with unstructured environments. Under this formulation, a novel network, Transqer, is introduced. The Transqer enables online DRL learning from temporal transitions, substantially enhancing decision-making in dynamic scenarios. To facilitate scalable training of Transqer with diverse data, an efficient simulation platform E-Sparrow, along with a data augmentation technique leveraging symmetric invariance, are developed. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, alongside assessments of generalizability, scalability, and real-time performance, were conducted to validate the effectiveness of ColorDynamic. Results indicate that our approach achieves a success rate exceeding 90% while exhibiting real-time capacity (1.2-1.3 ms per planning). Additionally, ablation studies were performed to corroborate the contributions of individual components. Building on this, the OkayPlan-ColorDynamic (OPCD) navigation system is presented, with simulated and real-world experiments demonstrating its superiority and applicability in complex scenarios. The codebase and experimental demonstrations have been open-sourced on our website to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Enhancing Safety in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback via Rectified Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19933v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Balancing helpfulness and safety (harmlessness) is a critical challenge in aligning large language models (LLMs). Current approaches often decouple these two objectives, training separate preference models for helpfulness and safety, while framing safety as a constraint within a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) framework. This paper identifies a potential issue when using the widely adopted expected safety constraints for LLM safety alignment, termed "safety compensation", where the constraints are satisfied on expectation, but individual prompts may trade off safety, resulting in some responses being overly restrictive while others remain unsafe. To address this issue, we propose Rectified Policy Optimization (RePO), which replaces the expected safety constraint with critical safety constraints imposed on every prompt. At the core of RePO is a policy update mechanism driven by rectified policy gradients, which penalizes the strict safety violation of every prompt, thereby enhancing safety across nearly all prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that RePO outperforms strong baseline methods and significantly enhances LLM safety alignment.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), NotaGen adopts pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning paradigms (henceforth referred to as the LLM training paradigms). It is pre-trained on 1.6M pieces of music, and then fine-tuned on approximately 9K high-quality classical compositions conditioned on "period-composer-instrumentation" prompts. For reinforcement learning, we propose the CLaMP-DPO method, which further enhances generation quality and controllability without requiring human annotations or predefined rewards. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CLaMP-DPO in symbolic music generation models with different architectures and encoding schemes. Furthermore, subjective A/B tests show that NotaGen outperforms baseline models against human compositions, greatly advancing musical aesthetics in symbolic music generation.</p></details> |  |

The inherent non-convexity of the lower-level RL problem is, however, to be an impediment to developing bilevel optimization methods. By employing the fixed point equation associated with the regularized RL, we characterize the hyper-gradient via fully first-order information, thus circumventing the assumption of lower-level convexity. This, remarkably, distinguishes our development of hyper-gradient from the general AID-based bilevel frameworks since we take advantage of the specific structure of RL problems. Moreover, we design both model-based and model-free bilevel reinforcement learning algorithms, facilitated by access to the fully first-order hyper-gradient. Both algorithms enjoy the convergence rate $O(\epsilon^{-1})$. To extend the applicability, a stochastic version of the model-free algorithm is proposed, along with results on its iteration and sample complexity. In addition, numerical experiments demonstrate that the hyper-gradient indeed serves as an integration of exploitation and exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This v2 is a camera-ready version of AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods, such as Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning, often require training multiple property predictors and struggle to incorporate substructure constraints. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose ChatMol, a novel approach that leverages LLMs for molecule design across diverse constraint settings. Initially, we crafted a molecule representation compatible with LLMs and validated its efficacy across multiple online LLMs. Afterwards, we developed specific prompts geared towards diverse constrained molecule generation tasks to further fine-tune current LLMs while integrating feedback learning derived from property prediction. Finally, to address the limitations of LLMs in numerical recognition, we referred to the position encoding method and incorporated additional encoding for numerical values within the prompt. Experimental results across single-property, substructure-property, and multi-property constrained tasks demonstrate that ChatMol consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including VAE and RL-based methods. Notably, in multi-objective binding affinity maximization task, ChatMol achieves a significantly lower KD value of 0.25 for the protein target ESR1, while maintaining the highest overall performance, surpassing previous methods by 4.76%. Meanwhile, with numerical enhancement, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the instructed property values and those of the generated molecules increased by up to 0.49. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as a versatile framework for molecule generation, offering a promising alternative to traditional latent space and RL-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures,conference</p></details> |

Previous studies have focused on planning with predefined options or learned options through expert demonstration data. Inspired by MuZero, which learns superhuman heuristics without any human knowledge, we propose a novel approach, named OptionZero. OptionZero incorporates an option network into MuZero, providing autonomous discovery of options through self-play games. Furthermore, we modify the dynamics network to provide environment transitions when using options, allowing searching deeper under the same simulation constraints. Empirical experiments conducted in 26 Atari games demonstrate that OptionZero outperforms MuZero, achieving a 131.58% improvement in mean human-normalized score. Our behavior analysis shows that OptionZero not only learns options but also acquires strategic skills tailored to different game characteristics. Our findings show promising directions for discovering and using options in planning.

| **[Reward Shaping to Mitigate Reward Hacking in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18770v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to reward hacking, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. While reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests three key design principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best formulated as a function of centered reward. Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model itself as the signal for reinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B and Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF. Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training. Code is available at https://github.com/PorUna-byte/PAR.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Existing methods either design a fixed CoT tailored for a specific MT sub-task (e.g., literature translation), or rely on synthesizing CoTs unaligned with humans and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) prone to catastrophic forgetting, limiting their adaptability to diverse translation scenarios. This paper introduces R1-Translator (R1-T1), a novel framework to achieve inference-time reasoning for general MT via reinforcement learning (RL) with human-aligned CoTs comprising six common patterns. Our approach pioneers three innovations: (1) extending reasoning-based translation beyond MT sub-tasks to six languages and diverse tasks (e.g., legal/medical domain adaptation, idiom resolution); (2) formalizing six expert-curated CoT templates that mirror hybrid human strategies like context-aware paraphrasing and back translation; and (3) enabling self-evolving CoT discovery and anti-forgetting adaptation through RL with KL-constrained rewards. Experimental results indicate a steady translation performance improvement in 21 languages and 80 translation directions on Flores-101 test set, especially on the 15 languages unseen from training, with its general multilingual abilities preserved compared with plain SFT.</p></details> |  |

Effective crop management requires optimizing yield and economic returns while minimizing environmental impact, a complex sequential decision-making problem well suited for RL. However, the lack of simulators for perennial crops in multi-farm contexts has hindered RL applications in this domain. Existing crop simulators also do not support multiple annual crops. WOFOSTGym addresses these gaps by supporting 23 annual crops and two perennial crops, enabling RL agents to learn diverse agromanagement strategies in multi-year, multi-crop, and multi-farm settings. Our simulator offers a suite of challenging tasks for learning under partial observability, non-Markovian dynamics, and delayed feedback. WOFOSTGym's standard RL interface allows researchers without agricultural expertise to explore a wide range of agromanagement problems. Our experiments demonstrate the learned behaviors across various crop varieties and soil types, highlighting WOFOSTGym's potential for advancing RL-driven decision support in agriculture.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, in large-scale multi-agent systems commonly found in real-world applications, effective communication plays an even more critical role due to the escalated challenge of partial observability compared to smaller-scale setups. In this work, we endeavor to develop a scalable communication protocol for MARL. Unlike previous methods that focus on selecting optimal pairwise communication links-a task that becomes increasingly complex as the number of agents grows-we adopt a global perspective on communication topology design. Specifically, we propose utilizing the exponential topology to enable rapid information dissemination among agents by leveraging its small-diameter and small-size properties. This approach leads to a scalable communication protocol, named ExpoComm. To fully unlock the potential of exponential graphs as communication topologies, we employ memory-based message processors and auxiliary tasks to ground messages, ensuring that they reflect global information and benefit decision-making. Extensive experiments on large-scale cooperative benchmarks, including MAgent and Infrastructure Management Planning, demonstrate the superior performance and robust zero-shot transferability of ExpoComm compared to existing communication strategies.

To address this complex problem, we introduce a fully distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm. Our novel algorithm, the noisy value method with a recurrent policy in multi-agent policy optimization (NVR-MAPPO), enhances performance by encouraging diverse exploration under centralized training and decentralized execution.

However, existing methods of guidewire navigation rely on manual demonstration data and have a suboptimal success rate. In this work, we propose a knowledge-driven visual guidance (KVG) method that leverages available visual information from interventional imaging to facilitate guidewire navigation. Our approach integrates image segmentation and detection techniques to extract surgical knowledge, including vascular maps and guidewire positions. We introduce BDA-star, a novel path planning algorithm with boundary distance constraints, to optimize trajectory planning for guidewire navigation. To validate the method, we developed the KVD-Reinforcement Learning environment, where observations consist of real-time guidewire feeding images highlighting the guidewire tip position and the planned path. We proposed a reward function based on the distances from both the guidewire tip to the planned path and the target to evaluate the agent's actions.Additionally, to address stability issues and slow convergence rates associated with direct learning from raw pixels, we incorporated a pre-trained convolutional neural network into the policy network for feature extraction. Experiments conducted on the aortic simulation autonomous guidewire navigation platform demonstrated that the proposed method, targeting the left subclavian artery, left carotid artery and the brachiocephalic artery, achieved a 100\% guidewire navigation success rate, along with reduced movement and retraction distances and trajectories tend to the center of the vessels.</p></details> |  |

While prior work on RLVR has primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, its applicability to other tasks and domains remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether medical reasoning can emerge from RLVR. We introduce Med-RLVR as an initial study of RLVR in the medical domain leveraging medical multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) data as verifiable labels. Our results demonstrate that RLVR is not only effective for math and coding but also extends successfully to medical question answering. Notably, Med-RLVR achieves performance comparable to traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on in-distribution tasks while significantly improving out-of-distribution generalization, with an 8-point accuracy gain. Further analysis of training dynamics reveals that, with no explicit reasoning supervision, reasoning emerges from the 3B-parameter base model. These findings underscore the potential of RLVR in domains beyond math and coding, opening new avenues for its application in knowledge-intensive fields such as medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Gymnasium: A Unified Modular Benchmark for Robust Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19652v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by inherent uncertainty and the sim-to-real gap, robust reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to improve resilience against the complexity and variability in agent-environment sequential interactions. Despite the existence of a large number of RL benchmarks, there is a lack of standardized benchmarks for robust RL. Current robust RL policies often focus on a specific type of uncertainty and are evaluated in distinct, one-off environments. In this work, we introduce Robust-Gymnasium, a unified modular benchmark designed for robust RL that supports a wide variety of disruptions across all key RL components-agents' observed state and reward, agents' actions, and the environment. Offering over sixty diverse task environments spanning control and robotics, safe RL, and multi-agent RL, it provides an open-source and user-friendly tool for the community to assess current methods and foster the development of robust RL algorithms. In addition, we benchmark existing standard and robust RL algorithms within this framework, uncovering significant deficiencies in each and offering new insights.</p></details> |  |

AutoBS leverages the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and fast, site-specific pathloss predictions from PMNet to efficiently learn deployment strategies that balance coverage and capacity. Numerical results demonstrate that AutoBS achieves 95% for a single BS, and 90% for multiple BSs, of the capacity provided by exhaustive search methods while reducing inference time from hours to milliseconds, making it highly suitable for real-time applications. AutoBS offers a scalable and automated solution for large-scale 6G networks, addressing the challenges of dynamic environments with minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

Although Medical Visual Language Models (VLMs) show promise for radiological tasks, most existing VLMs merely produce final answers without revealing the underlying reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce MedVLM-R1, a medical VLM that explicitly generates natural language reasoning to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Instead of relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often suffers from overfitting to training distributions and fails to foster genuine reasoning, MedVLM-R1 employs a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the model to discover human-interpretable reasoning paths without using any reasoning references. Despite limited training data (600 visual question answering samples) and model parameters (2B), MedVLM-R1 boosts accuracy from 55.11% to 78.22% across MRI, CT, and X-ray benchmarks, outperforming larger models trained on over a million samples. It also demonstrates robust domain generalization under out-of-distribution tasks. By unifying medical image analysis with explicit reasoning, MedVLM-R1 marks a pivotal step toward trustworthy and interpretable AI in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-rewarding correction for mathematical reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19613v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study self-rewarding reasoning large language models (LLMs), which can simultaneously generate step-by-step reasoning and evaluate the correctness of their outputs during the inference time-without external feedback. This integrated approach allows a single model to independently guide its reasoning process, offering computational advantages for model deployment. We particularly focus on the representative task of self-correction, where models autonomously detect errors in their responses, revise outputs, and decide when to terminate iterative refinement loops. To enable this, we propose a two-staged algorithmic framework for constructing self-rewarding reasoning models using only self-generated data. In the first stage, we employ sequential rejection sampling to synthesize long chain-of-thought trajectories that incorporate both self-rewarding and self-correction mechanisms. Fine-tuning models on these curated data allows them to learn the patterns of self-rewarding and self-correction. In the second stage, we further enhance the models' ability to assess response accuracy and refine outputs through reinforcement learning with rule-based signals. Experiments with Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 demonstrate that our approach surpasses intrinsic self-correction capabilities and achieves performance comparable to systems that rely on external reward models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asymptotic Analysis of Sample-averaged Q-learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10737v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key approach for training agents in complex and uncertain environments. Incorporating statistical inference in RL algorithms is essential for understanding and managing uncertainty in model performance. This paper introduces a generalized framework for time-varying batch-averaged Q-learning, termed sample-averaged Q-learning (SA-QL), which extends traditional single-sample Q-learning by aggregating samples of rewards and next states to better account for data variability and uncertainty. We leverage the functional central limit theorem (FCLT) to establish a novel framework that provides insights into the asymptotic normality of the sample-averaged algorithm under mild conditions. Additionally, we develop a random scaling method for interval estimation, enabling the construction of confidence intervals without requiring extra hyperparameters. Extensive numerical experiments across classic stochastic OpenAI Gym environments, including windy gridworld and slippery frozenlake, demonstrate how different batch scheduling strategies affect learning efficiency, coverage rates, and confidence interval widths. This work establishes a unified theoretical foundation for sample-averaged Q-learning, providing insights into effective batch scheduling and statistical inference for RL algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Scalable General Utility Reinforcement Learning: Occupancy Approximation, Sample Complexity and Global Optimality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04108v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with general utilities has recently gained attention thanks to its ability to unify several problems, including imitation learning, pure exploration, and safe reinforcement learning. However, prior work for solving this general problem in a unified way has only focused on the tabular setting. This is restrictive when considering larger state-action spaces because of the need to estimate occupancy measures during policy optimization. In this work, we address this issue and propose to approximate occupancy measures within a function approximation class using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We propose a simple policy gradient algorithm where an actor updates the policy parameters to maximize the general utility objective whereas a critic approximates the occupancy measure using MLE. We provide a statistical complexity analysis showing that our occupancy measure estimation error only scales with the dimension of our function approximation class rather than the size of the state action space. Under suitable assumptions, we establish first order stationarity and global optimality performance bounds for the proposed algorithm for nonconcave and concave general utilities respectively. We complement our methodological and theoretical findings with promising empirical results showing the scalability potential of our approach compared to existing tabular count-based approaches.</p></details> | revised version |
| **[Distill Not Only Data but Also Rewards: Can Smaller Language Models Surpass Larger Ones?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19557v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilling large language models (LLMs) typically involves transferring the teacher model's responses through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, this approach neglects the potential to distill both data (output content) and reward signals (quality evaluations). Extracting reliable reward signals directly from teacher models is challenging, as LLMs are optimized for generation rather than evaluation, often resulting in biased or inconsistent assessments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel distillation pipeline that transfers both responses and rewards. Our method generates pseudo-rewards through a self-supervised mechanism that leverages the inherent structure of both teacher and student responses, enabling reward learning without explicit external evaluation. The reward model subsequently guides reinforcement learning (RL), allowing iterative refinement of the student model after an SFT warm-up phase. Experiments on GSM8K and MMLU-PRO demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional SFT-based approaches, enabling student models to surpass the performance of their teachers. This work highlights the potential for scalable, efficient distillation through structured self-supervised reward learning, reducing dependence on external reward supervision.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Prospect-Theoretic Policy Gradient Algorithm for Behavioral Alignment in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02605v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical reinforcement learning (RL) typically assumes rational decision-making based on expected utility theory. However, this model has been shown to be empirically inconsistent with actual human preferences, as evidenced in psychology and behavioral economics. Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) provides a more nuanced model for human-based decision-making, capturing diverse attitudes and perceptions toward risk, gains, and losses. While prior work has integrated CPT with RL to solve a CPT policy optimization problem, the understanding and practical impact of this formulation remain limited. We revisit the CPT-RL framework, offering new theoretical insights into the nature of optimal policies. We further derive a novel policy gradient theorem for CPT objectives, generalizing the foundational result in standard RL. Building on this theorem, we design a model-free policy gradient algorithm for solving the CPT-RL problem and demonstrate its performance through simulations. Notably, our algorithm scales better to larger state spaces compared to existing zeroth-order methods. This work advances the integration of behavioral decision-making into RL.</p></details> | revised version |
| **[Assessing Autonomous Inspection Regimes: Active Versus Passive Satellite Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19556v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of satellite inspection, where one or more satellites (inspectors) are tasked with imaging or inspecting a resident space object (RSO) due to potential malfunctions or anomalies. Inspection strategies are often reduced to a discretized action space with predefined waypoints, facilitating tractability in both classical optimization and machine learning based approaches. However, this discretization can lead to suboptimal guidance in certain scenarios. This study presents a comparative simulation to explore the tradeoffs of passive versus active strategies in multi-agent missions. Key factors considered include RSO dynamic mode, state uncertainty, unmodeled entrance criteria, and inspector motion types. The evaluation is conducted with a focus on fuel utilization and surface coverage. Building on a Monte-Carlo based evaluator of passive strategies and a reinforcement learning framework for training active inspection policies, this study investigates conditions under which passive strategies, such as Natural Motion Circumnavigation (NMC), may perform comparably to active strategies like Reinforcement Learning based waypoint transfers.</p></details> |  |

Unlocking the key to SoftMoE's efficacy in deep RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01930v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of deep neural networks in reinforcement learning (RL) often suffers from performance degradation as model size increases. While soft mixtures of experts (SoftMoEs) have recently shown promise in mitigating this issue for online RL, the reasons behind their effectiveness remain largely unknown. In this work we provide an in-depth analysis identifying the key factors driving this performance gain. We discover the surprising result that tokenizing the encoder output, rather than the use of multiple experts, is what is behind the efficacy of SoftMoEs. Indeed, we demonstrate that even with an appropriately scaled single expert, we are able to maintain the performance gains, largely thanks to tokenization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalist World Model Pre-Training for Efficient Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19544v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample-efficient robot learning is a longstanding goal in robotics. Inspired by the success of scaling in vision and language, the robotics community is now investigating large-scale offline datasets for robot learning. However, existing methods often require expert and/or reward-labeled task-specific data, which can be costly and limit their application in practice. In this paper, we consider a more realistic setting where the offline data consists of reward-free and non-expert multi-embodiment offline data. We show that generalist world model pre-training (WPT), together with retrieval-based experience rehearsal and execution guidance, enables efficient reinforcement learning (RL) and fast task adaptation with such non-curated data. In experiments over 72 visuomotor tasks, spanning 6 different embodiments, covering hard exploration, complex dynamics, and various visual properties, WPT achieves 35.65% and 35% higher aggregated score compared to widely used learning-from-scratch baselines, respectively.</p></details> |  |

For example, prior work benchmarking the performance of multilingual LLMs on code-mixed translation tasks has demonstrated that current state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs are ineffective in dealing with code-mixed languages. However, the question of how to improve the capability of multilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed language has not received any attention to date. In this paper, we tackle this research gap by proposing CHAI, a novel general-purpose framework for improving the ability of multilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed languages. CHAI relies on three novel contributions made in this paper. First, we explore the ability of LLMs to provide accurate annotations for code-mixed translation tasks. Second, we leverage this ability of LLMs as annotators to generate preference data for code-mixed translation tasks at scale, which are then used within a reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) procedure to improve LLMs' capability on code-mixed tasks. Third, we conduct a rigorous experimental evaluation across various real-world datasets and settings. Our analysis shows that CHAI-powered LLMs outperform state-of-the-art open-source LLMs by 25.66% (in terms of win rate adjudicated by human annotators) in code-mixed translation tasks. This work represents a first step towards developing more inclusive code-mixed LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>full ...</summary><p>full draft: 8 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

Balanced Policy Switching in Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01837v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) -- finding the optimal behaviour (also referred to as policy) maximizing the collected long-term cumulative reward -- is among the most influential approaches in machine learning with a large number of successful applications. In several decision problems, however, one faces the possibility of policy switching -- changing from the current policy to a new one -- which incurs a non-negligible cost, and in the decision one is limited to using historical data without the availability for further online interaction. Despite the inevitable importance of this offline learning scenario, to our best knowledge, very little effort has been made to tackle the key problem of balancing between the gain and the cost of switching in a flexible and principled way. Leveraging ideas from the area of optimal transport, we initialize the systematic study of policy switching in offline RL. We establish fundamental properties and design a Net Actor-Critic algorithm for the proposed novel switching formulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on multiple robot control benchmarks of the Gymnasium and traffic light control from SUMO-RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conversational Planning for Personal Plans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19500v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The language generation and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have enabled conversational systems with impressive performance in a variety of tasks, from code generation, to composing essays, to passing STEM and legal exams, to a new paradigm for knowledge search. Besides those short-term use applications, LLMs are increasingly used to help with real-life goals or tasks that take a long time to complete, involving multiple sessions across days, weeks, months, or even years. Thus to enable conversational systems for long term interactions and tasks, we need language-based agents that can plan for long horizons. Traditionally, such capabilities were addressed by reinforcement learning agents with hierarchical planning capabilities. In this work, we explore a novel architecture where the LLM acts as the meta-controller deciding the agent's next macro-action, and tool use augmented LLM-based option policies execute the selected macro-action. We instantiate this framework for a specific set of macro-actions enabling adaptive planning for users' personal plans through conversation and follow-up questions collecting user feedback. We show how this paradigm can be applicable in scenarios ranging from tutoring for academic and non-academic tasks to conversational coaching for personal health plans.</p></details> |  |

The search efforts, however, must be undertaken in minimum time to maximize the chance of survival of the victim. Whilst the advent of cheap multicopters in recent years has changed the way search operations are handled, it has not solved the challenges of the massive areas at hand. The problem therefore is not one of complete coverage, but one of maximizing the information gathered in the limited time available. In this work we propose that a combination of a recurrent autoencoder and deep reinforcement learning is a more efficient solution to the search problem than previous pure deep reinforcement learning or optimisation approaches. The autoencoder training paradigm efficiently maximizes the information throughput of the encoder into its latent space representation which deep reinforcement learning is primed to leverage. Without the overhead of independently solving the problem that the recurrent autoencoder is designed for, it is more efficient in learning the control task. We further implement three additional architectures for a comprehensive comparison of the main proposed architecture. Similarly, we apply both soft actor-critic and proximal policy optimisation to provide an insight into the performance of both in a highly non-linear and complex application with a large observation Results show that the proposed architecture is vastly superior to the benchmarks, with soft actor-critic achieving the best performance. This model further outperformed work from the literature whilst having below a fifth of the total learnable parameters and training in a quarter of the time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Machine Learning with Applications</p></details> |

Nonetheless, how to enable robots to automatically plan trajectories for changing tasks presents a considerable challenge. Further complexities arise when robots operate within work cells alongside machines, humans, or other robots. This paper introduces a multi-level hybrid robot motion planning method combining a task space Reinforcement Learning-based Learning from Demonstration (RL-LfD) agent and a joint-space based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based agent. A higher level agent learns to switch between the two agents to enable feasible and smooth motion. The feasibility is computed by incorporating reachability, joint limits, manipulability, and collision risks of the robot in the given environment. Therefore, the derived hybrid motion planning policy generates a feasible trajectory that adheres to task constraints. The effectiveness of the method is validated through sim ulated robotic scenarios and in a real-world setup.</p></details> | 35 Pages, 11 Figures |

This results in notable sample inefficiency and hinders generalization across diverse tasks. The complexity is further pronounced in relational settings, where domain knowledge is crucial but often underutilized by existing MARL algorithms. To overcome these hurdles, we propose integrating relational planners as centralized controllers with efficient state abstractions and reinforcement learning. This approach proves to be sample-efficient and facilitates effective task transfer and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Computerized Adaptive Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19275v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computerized adaptive tests (CATs) play a crucial role in educational assessment and diagnostic screening in behavioral health. Unlike traditional linear tests that administer a fixed set of pre-assembled items, CATs adaptively tailor the test to an examinee's latent trait level by selecting a smaller subset of items based on their previous responses. Existing CAT frameworks predominantly rely on item response theory (IRT) models with a single latent variable, a choice driven by both conceptual simplicity and computational feasibility. However, many real-world item response datasets exhibit complex, multi-factor structures, limiting the applicability of CATs in broader settings. In this work, we develop a novel CAT system that incorporates multivariate latent traits, building on recent advances in Bayesian sparse multivariate IRT. Our approach leverages direct sampling from the latent factor posterior distributions, significantly accelerating existing information-theoretic item selection criteria by eliminating the need for computationally intensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Recognizing the potential sub-optimality of existing item selection rules, which are often based on myopic one-step-lookahead optimization of some information-theoretic criterion, we propose a double deep Q-learning algorithm to learn an optimal item selection policy. Through simulation and real-data studies, we demonstrate that our approach not only accelerates existing item selection methods but also highlights the potential of reinforcement learning in CATs.</p></details> |  |

A Policy Coverage Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19255v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency is critical for online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While existing works investigate sample-efficient online exploration strategies, the potential of utilizing misspecified yet relevant reward models to accelerate learning remains underexplored. This paper studies how to transfer knowledge from those imperfect reward models in online RLHF. We start by identifying a novel property of the KL-regularized RLHF objective: \emph{a policy's ability to cover the optimal policy is captured by its sub-optimality}. Building on this insight, we propose a theoretical transfer learning algorithm with provable benefits compared to standard online learning. Our approach achieves low regret in the early stage by quickly adapting to the best available source reward models without prior knowledge of their quality, and over time, it attains an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound \emph{independent} of structural complexity measures. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop an empirical algorithm with improved computational efficiency, and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically in summarization tasks.</p></details> | 35 Pages |

While preference optimization methods enhance reasoning performance through training, they often lack transparency in why one reasoning outcome is preferred over another. Verbal reflection techniques improve explainability but are limited in LLMs' critique and refinement capacity. To address these challenges, we introduce a contrastive reflection synthesis pipeline that enhances the accuracy and depth of LLM-generated reflections. We further propose a dual-model reasoning framework within a verbal reinforcement learning paradigm, decoupling inference-time self-reflection into specialized, trained models for reasoning critique and refinement. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms traditional preference optimization methods across all evaluation metrics. Our findings also show that "two heads are better than one", demonstrating that a collaborative Reasoner-Critic model achieves superior reasoning performance and transparency, compared to single-model approaches.</p></details> |  |

By employing RL, we achieve near-optimal synthesis of Linear Function, Clifford, and Permutation circuits, up to 9, 11 and 65 qubits respectively, while being compatible with native device instruction sets and connectivity constraints, and orders of magnitude faster than optimization methods such as SAT solvers. We also achieve significant reductions in two-qubit gate depth and count for circuit routing up to 133 qubits with respect to other routing heuristics such as SABRE. We find the method to be efficient enough to be useful in practice in typical quantum transpiling pipelines. Our results set the stage for further AI-powered enhancements of quantum computing workflows.</p></details> |  |

AWE is based on flying devices (usually gliders or kites) that, tethered to a ground station and driven by the wind, convert its mechanical energy into electrical energy by means of a generator. Such systems are usually controlled by manoeuvering the kite so as to follow a predefined path prescribed by optimal control techniques, such as model-predictive control. These methods are strongly dependent on the specific model at use and difficult to generalize, especially in unpredictable conditions such as the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer. Our aim is to explore the possibility of replacing these techniques with an approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional methods, RL does not require a predefined model, making it robust to variability and uncertainty. Our experimental results in complex simulated environments demonstrate that AWE agents trained with RL can effectively extract energy from turbulent flows, relying on minimal local information about the kite orientation and speed relative to the wind.</p></details> |  |

Often, a direct functional grasp is not possible, though. We propose a method for learning a dexterous pre-grasp manipulation policy to achieve human-like functional grasps using deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a dense multi-component reward function that enables learning a single policy, capable of dexterous pre-grasp manipulation of novel instances of several known object categories with an anthropomorphic hand. The policy is learned purely by means of reinforcement learning from scratch, without any expert demonstrations. It implicitly learns to reposition and reorient objects of complex shapes to achieve given functional grasps. In addition, we explore two different ways to represent a desired grasp: explicit and more abstract, constraint-based. We show that our method consistently learns to successfully manipulate and achieve desired grasps on previously unseen object instances of known categories using both grasp representations. Training is completed on a single GPU in under three hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear: IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (T-ASE), 2025</p></details> |

Although personalized preference learning addresses this by tailoring separate preferences for individual users, the field lacks standardized methods to assess its effectiveness. We present a multi-faceted evaluation framework that measures not only performance but also fairness, unintended effects, and adaptability across varying levels of preference divergence. Through extensive experiments comparing eight personalization methods across three preference datasets, we demonstrate that performance differences between methods could reach 36% when users strongly disagree, and personalization can introduce up to 20% safety misalignment. These findings highlight the critical need for holistic evaluation approaches to advance the development of more effective and inclusive preference learning systems.</p></details> |  |

Together with these scientific breakthroughs/advances, research has been conducted to develop automated functional testing methods for finding faults in black-box Markov decision processes. Pang et al. (ISSTA 2022) presented a black-box fuzz testing framework called MDPFuzz. The method consists of a fuzzer whose main feature is to use Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to compute coverage of the test inputs as the likelihood to have already observed their results. This guidance through coverage evaluation aims at favoring novelty during testing and fault discovery in the decision model. Pang et al. evaluated their work with four use cases, by comparing the number of failures found after twelve-hour testing campaigns with or without the guidance of the GMMs (ablation study). In this paper, we verify some of the key findings of the original paper and explore the limits of MDPFuzz through reproduction and replication. We re-implemented the proposed methodology and evaluated our replication in a large-scale study that extends the original four use cases with three new ones. Furthermore, we compare MDPFuzz and its ablated counterpart with a random testing baseline. We also assess the effectiveness of coverage guidance for different parameters, something that has not been done in the original evaluation. Despite this parameter analysis and unlike Pang et al.'s original conclusions, we find that in most cases, the aforementioned ablated Fuzzer outperforms MDPFuzz, and conclude that the coverage model proposed does not lead to finding more faults.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author's version. 12 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

While Deep Learning (DL) has shown remarkable success in detecting XSS attacks, it remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to the discontinuous nature of its input-output mapping. These adversarial attacks employ mutation-based strategies for different components of XSS attack vectors, allowing adversarial agents to iteratively select mutations to evade detection. Our work replicates a state-of-the-art XSS adversarial attack, highlighting threats to validity in the reference work and extending it toward a more effective evaluation strategy. Moreover, we introduce an XSS Oracle to mitigate these threats. The experimental results show that our approach achieves an escape rate above 96% when the threats to validity of the replicated technique are addressed.</p></details> |  |

However, numerous challenges, including higher performance demands, difficulty in data acquisition under specific scenarios, limited sample size, and low-quality labeled data, hinder its development. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers an effective solution by enabling models to achieve satisfactory performance with only a limited number of labeled samples. While most FSL techniques are applied in the field of computer vision, they are not directly applicable to wireless signal processing. This study does not propose a new FSL-specific signal model but introduces a framework called MCLRL. This framework combines multi-domain contrastive learning with reinforcement learning. Multi-domain representations of signals enhance feature richness, while integrating contrastive learning and reinforcement learning architectures enables the extraction of deep features for classification. In downstream tasks, the model achieves excellent performance using only a few samples and minimal training cycles. Experimental results show that the MCLRL framework effectively extracts key features from signals, performs well in FSL tasks, and maintains flexibility in signal model selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement learning to learn quantum states for Heisenberg scaling accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02334v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning quantum states is a crucial task for realizing quantum information technology. Recently, neural approaches have emerged as promising methods for learning quantum states. We propose a meta-learning model that utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the process of learning quantum states. To improve the data efficiency of the RL, we introduce an action repetition strategy inspired by curriculum learning. The RL agent significantly improves the sample efficiency of learning random quantum states, and achieves infidelity scaling close to the Heisenberg limit. We also show that the RL agent trained using 3-qubit states can generalize to learning up to 5-qubit states. These results highlight the utility of RL-driven meta-learning to enhance the efficiency and generalizability of learning quantum states. Our approach can be applied to improve quantum control, quantum optimization, and quantum machine learning.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Distilling Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for In-Context Model-Based Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19009v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that Transformers can perform in-context reinforcement learning (RL) by imitating existing RL algorithms, enabling sample-efficient adaptation to unseen tasks without parameter updates. However, these models also inherit the suboptimal behaviors of the RL algorithms they imitate. This issue primarily arises due to the gradual update rule employed by those algorithms. Model-based planning offers a promising solution to this limitation by allowing the models to simulate potential outcomes before taking action, providing an additional mechanism to deviate from the suboptimal behavior. Rather than learning a separate dynamics model, we propose Distillation for In-Context Planning (DICP), an in-context model-based RL framework where Transformers simultaneously learn environment dynamics and improve policy in-context. We evaluate DICP across a range of discrete and continuous environments, including Darkroom variants and Meta-World. Our results show that DICP achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly fewer environment interactions than baselines, which include both model-free counterparts and existing meta-RL methods.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[A Multi-Agent DRL-Based Framework for Optimal Resource Allocation and Twin Migration in the Multi-Tier Vehicular Metaverse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19004v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although multi-tier vehicular Metaverse promises to transform vehicles into essential nodes -- within an interconnected digital ecosystem -- using efficient resource allocation and seamless vehicular twin (VT) migration, this can hardly be achieved by the existing techniques operating in a highly dynamic vehicular environment, since they can hardly balance multi-objective optimization problems such as latency reduction, resource utilization, and user experience (UX). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel multi-tier resource allocation and VT migration framework that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), a hierarchical Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism, and Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). The GCN-based model captures both spatial and temporal dependencies within the vehicular network; the Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism fosters cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure; and the MADRL algorithm jointly optimizes resource allocation and VT migration in real time. By modeling this dynamic and multi-tier vehicular Metaverse as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we develop a MADRL-based algorithm dubbed the Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MO-MADDPG), which can effectively balances the various conflicting objectives. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of this algorithm that is demonstrated to enhance scalability, reliability, and efficiency while considerably improving latency, resource utilization, migration cost, and overall UX by 12.8%, 9.7%, 14.2%, and 16.1%, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Overcoming the Price of Anarchy by Steering with Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18988v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Varied real world systems such as transportation networks, supply chains and energy grids present coordination problems where many agents must learn to share resources. It is well known that the independent and selfish interactions of agents in these systems may lead to inefficiencies, often referred to as the `Price of Anarchy'. Effective interventions that reduce the Price of Anarchy while preserving individual autonomy are of great interest. In this paper we explore recommender systems as one such intervention mechanism. We start with the Braess Paradox, a congestion game model of a routing problem related to traffic on roads, packets on the internet, and electricity on power grids. Following recent literature, we model the interactions of agents as a repeated game between $Q$-learners, a common type of reinforcement learning agents. This work introduces the Learning Dynamic Manipulation Problem, where an external recommender system can strategically trigger behavior by picking the states observed by $Q$-learners during learning. Our computational contribution demonstrates that appropriately chosen recommendations can robustly steer the system towards convergence to the social optimum, even for many players. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight that increases in the recommendation space can increase the steering potential of a recommender system, which should be considered in the design of recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

Performing manipulation in such environments presents significant difficulty due to complex contact relationships. Existing methods typically address this task by sequentially grasping and removing each occluding object, resulting in lengthy execution times and requiring impractical grasping capabilities for every occluding object. In this paper, we present a dexterous arm-hand system for efficient object retrieval in multi-object stacked environments. Our approach leverages large-scale parallel reinforcement learning within diverse and carefully designed cluttered environments to train policies. These policies demonstrate emergent manipulation skills (e.g., pushing, stirring, and poking) that efficiently clear occluding objects to expose sufficient surface area of the target object. We conduct extensive evaluations across a set of over 10 household objects in diverse clutter configurations, demonstrating superior retrieval performance and efficiency for both trained and unseen objects. Furthermore, we successfully transfer the learned policies to a real-world dexterous multi-fingered robot system, validating their practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

However, existing simulators often rely solely on text utterances, missing implicit user traits such as personality, speaking style, and goals. In contrast, persona-based methods lack generalizability, as they depend on predefined profiles of famous individuals or archetypes. To address these challenges, we propose User Simulator with implicit Profiles (USP), a framework that infers implicit user profiles from human-machine conversations and uses them to generate more personalized and realistic dialogues. We first develop an LLM-driven extractor with a comprehensive profile schema. Then, we refine the simulation through conditional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with cycle consistency, optimizing it at both the utterance and conversation levels. Finally, we adopt a diverse profile sampler to capture the distribution of real-world user profiles. Experimental results demonstrate that USP outperforms strong baselines in terms of authenticity and diversity while achieving comparable performance in consistency. Furthermore, dynamic multi-turn evaluations based on USP strongly align with mainstream benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Fewer May Be Better: Enhancing Offline Reinforcement Learning with Reduced Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18955v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) represents a significant shift in RL research, allowing agents to learn from pre-collected datasets without further interaction with the environment. A key, yet underexplored, challenge in offline RL is selecting an optimal subset of the offline dataset that enhances both algorithm performance and training efficiency. Reducing dataset size can also reveal the minimal data requirements necessary for solving similar problems. In response to this challenge, we introduce ReDOR (Reduced Datasets for Offline RL), a method that frames dataset selection as a gradient approximation optimization problem. We demonstrate that the widely used actor-critic framework in RL can be reformulated as a submodular optimization objective, enabling efficient subset selection. To achieve this, we adapt orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), incorporating several novel modifications tailored for offline RL. Our experimental results show that the data subsets identified by ReDOR not only boost algorithm performance but also do so with significantly lower computational complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[VEM: Environment-Free Exploration for Training GUI Agent with Value Environment Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18906v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) agents via Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces critical challenges: environment-based RL requires costly interactions, while environment-free methods struggle with distribution shift and reward generalization. We propose an environment-free RL framework that decouples value estimation from policy optimization by leveraging a pretrained Value Environment Model (VEM). VEM predicts state-action values directly from offline data, distilling human-like priors about GUI interaction outcomes without requiring next-state prediction or environmental feedback. This avoids compounding errors and enhances resilience to UI changes by focusing on semantic reasoning (e.g., Does this action advance the user's goal?). The framework operates in two stages: (1) pretraining VEM to estimate long-term action utilities and (2) guiding policy exploration with frozen VEM signals, enabling layout-agnostic GUI automation. Evaluated on Android-in-the-Wild benchmarks, VEM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both offline and online settings, outperforming environment-free baselines significantly and matching environment-based approaches without interaction costs. Importantly, VEM demonstrates that semantic-aware value estimation can achieve comparable performance with online-trained methods.</p></details> | 20pages,5 figures |
| **[AURO: Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive User Retention Optimization in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03984v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention for its ability of optimizing user retention in recommender systems. A primary obstacle in this optimization process is the environment non-stationarity stemming from the continual and complex evolution of user behavior patterns over time, such as variations in interaction rates and retention propensities. These changes pose significant challenges to existing RL algorithms for recommendations, leading to issues with dynamics and reward distribution shifts. This paper introduces a novel approach called \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{U}ser \textbf{R}etention \textbf{O}ptimization (AURO) to address this challenge. To navigate the recommendation policy in non-stationary environments, AURO introduces an state abstraction module in the policy network. The module is trained with a new value-based loss function, aligning its output with the estimated performance of the current policy. As the policy performance of RL is sensitive to environment drifts, the loss function enables the state abstraction to be reflective of environment changes and notify the recommendation policy to adapt accordingly. Additionally, the non-stationarity of the environment introduces the problem of implicit cold start, where the recommendation policy continuously interacts with users displaying novel behavior patterns. AURO encourages exploration guarded by performance-based rejection sampling to maintain a stable recommendation quality in the cost-sensitive online environment. Extensive empirical analysis are conducted in a user retention simulator, the MovieLens dataset, and a live short-video recommendation platform, demonstrating AURO's superior performance against all evaluated baseline algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>The W...</summary><p>The Web Conference 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Despite the widespread use of JSON in integrating language models with programs, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis and benchmarking of these capabilities. We explore various aspects of JSON generation, such as structure understanding, escaping, and natural language description, to determine how to assess and enable LLMs to generate valid responses. Building upon this, we propose SchemaBench features around 40K different JSON schemas to obtain and assess models' abilities in generating valid JSON. We find that the latest LLMs are still struggling to generate a valid JSON string. Moreover, we demonstrate that incorporating reinforcement learning with a Fine-grained Schema Validator can further enhance models' understanding of JSON schema, leading to improved performance. Our models demonstrate significant improvement in both generating JSON outputs and downstream tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[RL-OGM-Parking: Lidar OGM-Based Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Planner for Autonomous Parking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18846v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous parking has become a critical application in automatic driving research and development. Parking operations often suffer from limited space and complex environments, requiring accurate perception and precise maneuvering. Traditional rule-based parking algorithms struggle to adapt to diverse and unpredictable conditions, while learning-based algorithms lack consistent and stable performance in various scenarios. Therefore, a hybrid approach is necessary that combines the stability of rule-based methods and the generalizability of learning-based methods. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) based policy has shown robust capability in planning tasks. However, the simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer gap seriously blocks the real-world deployment. To address these problems, we employ a hybrid policy, consisting of a rule-based Reeds-Shepp (RS) planner and a learning-based reinforcement learning (RL) planner. A real-time LiDAR-based Occupancy Grid Map (OGM) representation is adopted to bridge the sim-to-real gap, leading the hybrid policy can be applied to real-world systems seamlessly. We conducted extensive experiments both in the simulation environment and real-world scenarios, and the result demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms pure rule-based and learning-based methods. The real-world experiment further validates the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Multi-Robot Collaboration from Single-Human Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19831v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning collaborative behaviors is essential for multi-agent systems. Traditionally, multi-agent reinforcement learning solves this implicitly through a joint reward and centralized observations, assuming collaborative behavior will emerge. Other studies propose to learn from demonstrations of a group of collaborative experts. Instead, we propose an efficient and explicit way of learning collaborative behaviors in multi-agent systems by leveraging expertise from only a single human. Our insight is that humans can naturally take on various roles in a team. We show that agents can effectively learn to collaborate by allowing a human operator to dynamically switch between controlling agents for a short period and incorporating a human-like theory-of-mind model of teammates. Our experiments showed that our method improves the success rate of a challenging collaborative hide-and-seek task by up to 58% with only 40 minutes of human guidance. We further demonstrate our findings transfer to the real world by conducting multi-robot experiments.</p></details> |  |

The proposed DRL-based approach improves task processing efficiency, reduces overall processing time, enhances resource utilization, and effectively controls task migrations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DRL over traditional scheduling algorithms, particularly in managing complex task allocation, dynamic workloads, and multiple resource constraints. Despite its advantages, further improvements are needed to enhance learning efficiency, reduce training time, and address convergence issues. Future research should focus on increasing the algorithm's fault tolerance to handle more complex and uncertain scheduling scenarios, thereby advancing the intelligence and efficiency of edge-cloud computing systems.</p></details> |  |

This involves handling contact-rich interactions and chaining multiple skills while considering their long-term consequences. This paper presents a framework that leverages imitation learning to distill a planning algorithm, capable of solving long-horizon problems but requiring extensive computation time, into a policy for efficient action inference. We introduce $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$, an extension of the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) that incorporates skill applicability checks and intermediate object pose sampling for efficient long-horizon planning. To enable skill chaining, we propose $\textit{connectors}$, goal-conditioned policies that transition between skills while minimizing object disturbance. Using lazy planning, connectors are selectively trained on relevant transitions, reducing the cost of training. High-quality demonstrations are generated with $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$ and refined by a noise-based replay mechanism to ensure robust policy performance. The distilled policy, trained entirely in simulation, zero-shot transfer to the real world, and achieves over 80% success rates across three challenging manipulation tasks. In simulation, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art skill-based reinforcement learning method, $\texttt{MAPLE}$, and $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://sites.google.com/view/skill-rrt</p></details> |

While this setting has been treated extensively, another popular training paradigm, learning from unsafe feedback with reinforcement learning, has previously been unexplored. This is concerning due to the widespread deployment of feedback collection systems. We address this gap by providing an analysis of learning settings where feedback is harmful, i.e. that unsafe samples are preferred over safe ones despite model developers goal to maintain safety. We find that safety-aligned LLMs easily explore unsafe action spaces via generating harmful text and optimize for reward that violates safety constraints indicating that current safety guards are not enough to prevent learning from unsafe feedback. In order to protect against this vulnerability, we adapt a number of both "implict" and "explicit" harmful fine-tuning defences to evaluate whether they are effective as learning constraints in an RLHF setting finding that no method is generally effective pointing to the need for more defence research. We end the paper with the observation that some defences work by performing "harmless reward hacking" for which we provide a theoretical explanation drawn from the theory of Constrained Markov Decision Processes and provide some direction for future defence development.</p></details> |  |

The past few years have witnessed the increasing popularity of data-driven approaches to automatically learn these heuristics. However, the success of these methods is highly dependent on the availability of high-quality demonstrations, which requires either the development of near-optimal heuristics or a time-consuming sampling process. This paper averts this challenge by proposing Suboptimal-Demonstration-Guided Reinforcement Learning (SORREL) for learning to branch. SORREL selectively learns from suboptimal demonstrations based on value estimation. It utilizes suboptimal demonstrations through both offline reinforcement learning on the demonstrations generated by suboptimal heuristics and self-imitation learning on past good experiences sampled by itself. Our experiments demonstrate its advanced performance in both branching quality and training efficiency over previous methods for various MILPs.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[MPO: An Efficient Post-Processing Framework for Mixing Diverse Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18699v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise in aligning large language models (LLMs). Yet its reliance on a singular reward model often overlooks the diversity of human preferences. Recent approaches address this limitation by leveraging multi-dimensional feedback to fine-tune corresponding reward models and train LLMs using reinforcement learning. However, the process is costly and unstable, especially given the competing and heterogeneous nature of human preferences. In this paper, we propose Mixing Preference Optimization (MPO), a post-processing framework for aggregating single-objective policies as an alternative to both multi-objective RLHF (MORLHF) and MaxMin-RLHF. MPO avoids alignment from scratch. Instead, it log-linearly combines existing policies into a unified one with the weight of each policy computed via a batch stochastic mirror descent. Empirical results demonstrate that MPO achieves balanced performance across diverse preferences, outperforming or matching existing models with significantly reduced computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Training and Execution via Dynamic Directed Graph-Based Communication in Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07397v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems must learn to communicate and understand interactions between agents to achieve cooperative goals in partially observed tasks. However, existing approaches lack a dynamic directed communication mechanism and rely on global states, thus diminishing the role of communication in centralized training. Thus, we propose the Transformer-based graph coarsening network (TGCNet), a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm. TGCNet learns the topological structure of a dynamic directed graph to represent the communication policy and integrates graph coarsening networks to approximate the representation of global state during training. It also utilizes the Transformer decoder for feature extraction during execution. Experiments on multiple cooperative MARL benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to popular MARL algorithms. Further ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our dynamic directed graph communication mechanism and graph coarsening networks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

The open-source CayleyPy project is a central component of our research. The present paper proposes a novel combination of a reinforcement learning approach with a more direct diffusion distance approach from the first paper. Our analysis includes benchmarking various choices for the key building blocks of the approach: architectures of the neural network, generators for the random walks and beam search pathfinding. We compared these methods against the classical computer algebra system GAP, demonstrating that they "overcome the GAP" for the considered examples. As a particular mathematical application we examine the Cayley graph of the symmetric group with cyclic shift and transposition generators. We provide strong support for the OEIS-A186783 conjecture that the diameter is equal to n(n-1)/2 by machine learning and mathematical methods. We identify the conjectured longest element and generate its decomposition of the desired length. We prove a diameter lower bound of n(n-1)/2-n/2 and an upper bound of n(n-1)/2+ 3n by presenting the algorithm with given complexity. We also present several conjectures motivated by numerical experiments, including observations on the central limit phenomenon (with growth approximated by a Gumbel distribution), the uniform distribution for the spectrum of the graph, and a numerical study of sorting networks. To stimulate crowdsourcing activity, we create challenges on the Kaggle platform and invite contributions to improve and benchmark approaches on Cayley graph pathfinding and other tasks.</p></details> | 28 pages |
| **[Provably Efficient RL for Linear MDPs under Instantaneous Safety Constraints in Non-Convex Feature Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18655v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Reinforcement Learning (RL), tasks with instantaneous hard constraints present significant challenges, particularly when the decision space is non-convex or non-star-convex. This issue is especially relevant in domains like autonomous vehicles and robotics, where constraints such as collision avoidance often take a non-convex form. In this paper, we establish a regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\bigl(\bigl(1 + \tfrac{1}{\tau}\bigr) \sqrt{\log(\tfrac{1}{\tau}) d^3 H^4 K} \bigr)$, applicable to both star-convex and non-star-convex cases, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ the episode length, $K$ the number of episodes, and $\tau$ the safety threshold. Moreover, the violation of safety constraints is zero with high probability throughout the learning process. A key technical challenge in these settings is bounding the covering number of the value-function class, which is essential for achieving value-aware uniform concentration in model-free function approximation. For the star-convex setting, we develop a novel technique called Objective Constraint-Decomposition (OCD) to properly bound the covering number. This result also resolves an error in a previous work on constrained RL. In non-star-convex scenarios, where the covering number can become infinitely large, we propose a two-phase algorithm, Non-Convex Safe Least Squares Value Iteration (NCS-LSVI), which first reduces uncertainty about the safe set by playing a known safe policy. After that, it carefully balances exploration and exploitation to achieve the regret bound. Finally, numerical simulations on an autonomous driving scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of NCS-LSVI.</p></details> |  |

Working with a parameterised set of DLOs, we use likelihood-free inference (LFI) to compute the posterior distributions for the physical parameters using which we can approximately simulate the behaviour of each specific DLO. We use these posteriors for domain randomisation while training, in simulation, object-specific visuomotor policies for a visuomotor DLO reaching task, using model-free reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by deploying sim-trained DLO manipulation policies in the real world in a zero-shot manner, i.e. without any further fine-tuning. In this context, we evaluate the capacity of a prominent LFI method to perform fine classification over the parametric set of DLOs, using only visual and proprioceptive data obtained in a dynamic manipulation trajectory. We then study the implications of the resulting domain distributions in sim-based policy learning and real-world performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error-related Potential driven Reinforcement Learning for adaptive Brain-Computer Interfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18594v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide alternative communication methods for individuals with motor disabilities by allowing control and interaction with external devices. Non-invasive BCIs, especially those using electroencephalography (EEG), are practical and safe for various applications. However, their performance is often hindered by EEG non-stationarities, caused by changing mental states or device characteristics like electrode impedance. This challenge has spurred research into adaptive BCIs that can handle such variations. In recent years, interest has grown in using error-related potentials (ErrPs) to enhance BCI performance. ErrPs, neural responses to errors, can be detected non-invasively and have been integrated into different BCI paradigms to improve performance through error correction or adaptation. This research introduces a novel adaptive ErrP-based BCI approach using reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate the feasibility of an RL-driven adaptive framework incorporating ErrPs and motor imagery. Utilizing two RL agents, the framework adapts dynamically to EEG non-stationarities. Validation was conducted using a publicly available motor imagery dataset and a fast-paced game designed to boost user engagement. Results show the framework's promise, with RL agents learning control policies from user interactions and achieving robust performance across datasets. However, a critical insight from the game-based protocol revealed that motor imagery in a high-speed interaction paradigm was largely ineffective for participants, highlighting task design limitations in real-time BCI applications. These findings underscore the potential of RL for adaptive BCIs while pointing out practical constraints related to task complexity and user responsiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-RL: Advancing LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning on Open Software Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18449v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent DeepSeek-R1 release has demonstrated the immense potential of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While DeepSeek-R1 and other follow-up work primarily focus on applying RL to competitive coding and math problems, this paper introduces SWE-RL, the first approach to scale RL-based LLM reasoning for real-world software engineering. Leveraging a lightweight rule-based reward (e.g., the similarity score between ground-truth and LLM-generated solutions), SWE-RL enables LLMs to autonomously recover a developer's reasoning processes and solutions by learning from extensive open-source software evolution data -- the record of a software's entire lifecycle, including its code snapshots, code changes, and events such as issues and pull requests. Trained on top of Llama 3, our resulting reasoning model, Llama3-SWE-RL-70B, achieves a 41.0% solve rate on SWE-bench Verified -- a human-verified collection of real-world GitHub issues. To our knowledge, this is the best performance reported for medium-sized (<100B) LLMs to date, even comparable to leading proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o. Surprisingly, despite performing RL solely on software evolution data, Llama3-SWE-RL has even emerged with generalized reasoning skills. For example, it shows improved results on five out-of-domain tasks, namely, function coding, library use, code reasoning, mathematics, and general language understanding, whereas a supervised-finetuning baseline even leads to performance degradation on average. Overall, SWE-RL opens up a new direction to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through reinforcement learning on massive software engineering data.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAPoRL: Multi-Agent Post-Co-Training for Collaborative Large Language Models with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18439v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) to build collaborative multi-agentic workflows has demonstrated significant potential. However, most previous studies focus on prompting the out-of-the-box LLMs, relying on their innate capability for collaboration, which may not improve LLMs' performance as shown recently. In this paper, we introduce a new post-training paradigm MAPoRL (Multi-Agent Post-co-training for collaborative LLMs with Reinforcement Learning), to explicitly elicit the collaborative behaviors and further unleash the power of multi-agentic LLM frameworks. In MAPoRL, multiple LLMs first generate their own responses independently and engage in a multi-turn discussion to collaboratively improve the final answer. In the end, a MAPoRL verifier evaluates both the answer and the discussion, by assigning a score that verifies the correctness of the answer, while adding incentives to encourage corrective and persuasive discussions. The score serves as the co-training reward, and is then maximized through multi-agent RL. Unlike existing LLM post-training paradigms, MAPoRL advocates the co-training of multiple LLMs together using RL for better generalization. Accompanied by analytical insights, our experiments demonstrate that training individual LLMs alone is insufficient to induce effective collaboration. In contrast, multi-agent co-training can boost the collaboration performance across benchmarks, with generalization to unseen domains.</p></details> |  |

This overlooks crucial aspects of individual reward dimensions and inter-reward dependencies that can lead to sub-optimal outcomes in generations. In this work, we show how linear aggregation of rewards exhibits some vulnerabilities that can lead to undesired properties of generated text. We then propose a transformation of reward functions inspired by economic theory of utility functions (specifically Inada conditions), that enhances sensitivity to low reward values while diminishing sensitivity to already high values. We compare our approach to the existing baseline methods that linearly aggregate rewards and show how the Inada-inspired reward feedback is superior to traditional weighted averaging. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyse the difference in the methods, and see that models trained with Inada-transformations score as more helpful while being less harmful.</p></details> |  |

As such, machine tending is a task collaborative robots can tackle that can also highly boost productivity. Nevertheless, existing robotics systems deployed in that sector rely on a fixed single-arm setup, whereas mobile robots can provide more flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce a multi-agent multi-machine tending learning framework by mobile robots based on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) techniques with the design of a suitable observation and reward. Moreover, an attention-based encoding mechanism is developed and integrated into Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to boost its performance for machine tending scenarios. Our model (AB-MAPPO) outperformed MAPPO in this new challenging scenario in terms of task success, safety, and resources utilization. Furthermore, we provided an extensive ablation study to support our various design decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, Accepted at an AAAI workshop (The Multi-Agent AI in the Real World Workshop)</p></details> |
| **[Target Defense with Multiple Defenders and an Agile Attacker via Residual Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18549v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The target defense problem involves intercepting an attacker before it reaches a designated target region using one or more defenders. This letter focuses on a particularly challenging scenario in which the attacker is more agile than the defenders, significantly increasing the difficulty of effective interception. To address this challenge, we propose a novel residual policy framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the force-based Boids model. In this framework, the Boids model serves as a baseline policy, while DRL learns a residual policy to refine and optimize the defenders' actions. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional interception policies, whether learned via vanilla DRL or fine-tuned from force-based methods. Moreover, the learned policy exhibits strong scalability and adaptability, effectively handling scenarios with varying numbers of defenders and attackers with different agility levels.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, dancing motions have been manually designed by artists, a process that is both labor-intensive and restricted to simple motion playback, lacking the flexibility to incorporate additional tasks such as locomotion or gaze control during dancing. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Deep Fourier Mimic (DFM), a novel method that combines advanced motion representation with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable smooth transitions between motions while concurrently managing auxiliary tasks during dance sequences. While previous frequency domain based motion representations have successfully encoded dance motions into latent parameters, they often impose overly rigid periodic assumptions at the local level, resulting in reduced tracking accuracy and motion expressiveness, which is a critical aspect for entertainment robots. By relaxing these locally periodic constraints, our approach not only enhances tracking precision but also facilitates smooth transitions between different motions. Furthermore, the learned RL policy that supports simultaneous base activities, such as locomotion and gaze control, allows entertainment robots to engage more dynamically and interactively with users rather than merely replaying static, pre-designed dance routines.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, many goals that humans care about naturally concern multiple aspects of the world, and it may not be obvious how to condense those into a single reward function. Furthermore, maximization suffers from specification gaming, where the obtained policy achieves a high expected total reward in an unintended way, often taking extreme or nonsensical actions. Here we consider finite acyclic Markov Decision Processes with multiple distinct evaluation metrics, which do not necessarily represent quantities that the user wants to be maximized. We assume the task of the agent is to ensure that the vector of expected totals of the evaluation metrics falls into some given convex set, called the aspiration set. Our algorithm guarantees that this task is fulfilled by using simplices to approximate feasibility sets and propagate aspirations forward while ensuring they remain feasible. It has complexity linear in the number of possible state-action-successor triples and polynomial in the number of evaluation metrics. Moreover, the explicitly non-maximizing nature of the chosen policy and goals yields additional degrees of freedom, which can be used to apply heuristic safety criteria to the choice of actions. We discuss several such safety criteria that aim to steer the agent towards more conservative behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages main text + 4 pages supplement.

| **[Controlling dynamics of stochastic systems with deep reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18111v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A properly designed controller can help improve the quality of experimental measurements or force a dynamical system to follow a completely new time-evolution path. Recent developments in deep reinforcement learning have made steep advances toward designing effective control schemes for fairly complex systems. However, a general simulation scheme that employs deep reinforcement learning for exerting control in stochastic systems is yet to be established. In this paper, we attempt to further bridge a gap between control theory and deep reinforcement learning by proposing a simulation algorithm that allows achieving control of the dynamics of stochastic systems through the use of trained artificial neural networks. Specifically, we use agent-based simulations where the neural network plays the role of the controller that drives local state-to-state transitions. We demonstrate the workflow and the effectiveness of the proposed control methods by considering the following two stochastic processes: particle coalescence on a lattice and a totally asymmetric exclusion process.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Following the Human Thread in Social Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11327v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of collaboration between humans and robots in shared environments relies on the robot's real-time adaptation to human motion. Specifically, in Social Navigation, the agent should be close enough to assist but ready to back up to let the human move freely, avoiding collisions. Human trajectories emerge as crucial cues in Social Navigation, but they are partially observable from the robot's egocentric view and computationally complex to process. We present the first Social Dynamics Adaptation model (SDA) based on the robot's state-action history to infer the social dynamics. We propose a two-stage Reinforcement Learning framework: the first learns to encode the human trajectories into social dynamics and learns a motion policy conditioned on this encoded information, the current status, and the previous action. Here, the trajectories are fully visible, i.e., assumed as privileged information. In the second stage, the trained policy operates without direct access to trajectories. Instead, the model infers the social dynamics solely from the history of previous actions and statuses in real-time. Tested on the novel Habitat 3.0 platform, SDA sets a novel state-of-the-art (SotA) performance in finding and following humans. The code can be found at https://github.com/L-Scofano/SDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 as a Spotlight Paper</p></details> |

This is particularly restrictive in robotics, where each data point must be physically executed in the real world. Consequently, there is a critical need for alternative data sources for robotics and frameworks that enable learning from such data. In this work, we present Point Policy, a new method for learning robot policies exclusively from offline human demonstration videos and without any teleoperation data. Point Policy leverages state-of-the-art vision models and policy architectures to translate human hand poses into robot poses while capturing object states through semantically meaningful key points. This approach yields a morphology-agnostic representation that facilitates effective policy learning. Our experiments on 8 real-world tasks demonstrate an overall 75% absolute improvement over prior works when evaluated in identical settings as training. Further, Point Policy exhibits a 74% gain across tasks for novel object instances and is robust to significant background clutter. Videos of the robot are best viewed at https://point-policy.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

While most exploration planners assume omnidirectional sensors like LiDAR, this is impractical for small robots such as drones, where lightweight, directional sensors like cameras may be the only option due to payload constraints. These sensors have a constrained field-of-view (FoV), which adds complexity to the exploration problem, requiring not only optimal robot positioning but also sensor orientation during movement. In this work, we propose MARVEL, a neural framework that leverages graph attention networks, together with novel frontiers and orientation features fusion technique, to develop a collaborative, decentralized policy using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for robots with constrained FoV. To handle the large action space of viewpoints planning, we further introduce a novel information-driven action pruning strategy. MARVEL improves multi-robot coordination and decision-making in challenging large-scale indoor environments, while adapting to various team sizes and sensor configurations (i.e., FoV and sensor range) without additional training. Our extensive evaluation shows that MARVEL's learned policies exhibit effective coordinated behaviors, outperforming state-of-the-art exploration planners across multiple metrics. We experimentally demonstrate MARVEL's generalizability in large-scale environments, of up to 90m by 90m, and validate its practical applicability through successful deployment on a team of real drone hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 20XX IEEE.

| **[Discovering Antagonists in Networks of Systems: Robot Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20125v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A contextual anomaly detection method is proposed and applied to the physical motions of a robot swarm executing a coverage task. Using simulations of a swarm's normal behavior, a normalizing flow is trained to predict the likelihood of a robot motion within the current context of its environment. During application, the predicted likelihood of the observed motions is used by a detection criterion that categorizes a robot agent as normal or antagonistic. The proposed method is evaluated on five different strategies of antagonistic behavior. Importantly, only readily available simulated data of normal robot behavior is used for training such that the nature of the anomalies need not be known beforehand. The best detection criterion correctly categorizes at least 80% of each antagonistic type while maintaining a false positive rate of less than 5% for normal robot agents. Additionally, the method is validated in hardware experiments, yielding results similar to the simulated scenarios. Compared to the state-of-the-art approach, both the predictive performance of the normalizing flow and the robustness of the detection criterion are increased.</p></details> |  |
| **[FuseGrasp: Radar-Camera Fusion for Robotic Grasping of Transparent Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20037v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transparent objects are prevalent in everyday environments, but their distinct physical properties pose significant challenges for camera-guided robotic arms. Current research is mainly dependent on camera-only approaches, which often falter in suboptimal conditions, such as low-light environments. In response to this challenge, we present FuseGrasp, the first radar-camera fusion system tailored to enhance the transparent objects manipulation. FuseGrasp exploits the weak penetrating property of millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals, which causes transparent materials to appear opaque, and combines it with the precise motion control of a robotic arm to acquire high-quality mmWave radar images of transparent objects. The system employs a carefully designed deep neural network to fuse radar and camera imagery, thereby improving depth completion and elevating the success rate of object grasping. Nevertheless, training FuseGrasp effectively is non-trivial, due to limited radar image datasets for transparent objects. We address this issue utilizing large RGB-D dataset, and propose an effective two-stage training approach: we first pre-train FuseGrasp on a large public RGB-D dataset of transparent objects, then fine-tune it on a self-built small RGB-D-Radar dataset. Furthermore, as a byproduct, FuseGrasp can determine the composition of transparent objects, such as glass or plastic, leveraging the material identification capability of mmWave radar. This identification result facilitates the robotic arm in modulating its grip force appropriately. Extensive testing reveals that FuseGrasp significantly improves the accuracy of depth reconstruction and material identification for transparent objects. Moreover, real-world robotic trials have confirmed that FuseGrasp markedly enhances the handling of transparent items. A video demonstration of FuseGrasp is available at https://youtu.be/MWDqv0sRSok.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Object Handover in a Robot Crafting Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19991v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots are increasingly working alongside people, delivering food to patrons in restaurants or helping workers on assembly lines. These scenarios often involve object handovers between the person and the robot. To achieve safe and efficient human-robot collaboration (HRC), it is important to incorporate human context in a robot's handover strategies. Therefore, in this work, we develop a collaborative handover model trained on human teleoperation data collected in a naturalistic crafting task. To evaluate the performance of this model, we conduct cross-validation experiments on the training dataset as well as a user study in the same HRC crafting task. The handover episodes and user perceptions of the autonomous handover policy were compared with those of the human teleoperated handovers. While the cross-validation experiment and user study indicate that the autonomous policy successfully achieved collaborative handovers, the comparison with human teleoperation revealed avenues for further improvements.</p></details> |  |

We highlight lessons that can be learned from biology to enhance the utility of GPTs in robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Incremental Model Informed Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Robotic Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01529v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning attempts to use an available or learned model to improve the data efficiency of reinforcement learning. This work proposes a one-step lookback approach that jointly learns the deep incremental model and the policy to realize the sample-efficient continuous robotic control, wherein the control-theoretical knowledge is utilized to decrease the model learning difficulty and facilitate efficient training. Specifically, we use one-step backward data to facilitate the deep incremental model, an alternative structured representation of the robotic evolution model, that accurately predicts the robotic movement but with low sample complexity. This is because the formulated deep incremental model degrades the model learning difficulty into a parametric matrix learning problem, which is especially favourable to high-dimensional robotic applications. The imagined data from the learned deep incremental model is used to supplement training data to enhance the sample efficiency. Comparative numerical simulations on benchmark continuous robotics control problems are conducted to validate the efficiency of our proposed one-step lookback approach.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the TRIFFID system, a comprehensive technical framework that integrates unmanned ground and aerial vehicles with advanced artificial intelligence functionalities to enhance disaster response capabilities across wildfires, urban floods, and post-earthquake search and rescue missions. By leveraging state-of-the-art autonomous navigation, semantic perception, and human-robot interaction technologies, TRIFFID provides a sophisticated system composed of the following key components: hybrid robotic platform, centralized ground station, custom communication infrastructure, and smartphone application. The defined research and development activities demonstrate how deep neural networks, knowledge graphs, and multimodal information fusion can enable robots to autonomously navigate and analyze disaster environments, reducing personnel risks and accelerating response times. The proposed system enhances emergency response teams by providing advanced mission planning, safety monitoring, and adaptive task execution capabilities. Moreover, it ensures real-time situational awareness and operational support in complex and risky situations, facilitating rapid and precise information collection and coordinated actions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Configuration Distance Function for Continuum Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13865v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel method for modeling the shape of a continuum robot as a Neural Configuration Euclidean Distance Function (N-CEDF). By learning separate distance fields for each link and combining them through the kinematics chain, the learned N-CEDF provides an accurate and computationally efficient representation of the robot's shape. The key advantage of a distance function representation of a continuum robot is that it enables efficient collision checking for motion planning in dynamic and cluttered environments, even with point-cloud observations. We integrate the N-CEDF into a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller to generate safe trajectories for multi-segment continuum robots. The proposed approach is validated for continuum robots with various links in several simulated environments with static and dynamic obstacles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaze-Guided Task Decomposition for Imitation Learning in Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15071v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In imitation learning for robotic manipulation, decomposing object manipulation tasks into sub-tasks enables the reuse of learned skills and the combination of learned behaviors to perform novel tasks, rather than simply replicating demonstrated motions. Human gaze is closely linked to hand movements during object manipulation. We hypothesize that an imitating agent's gaze control, fixating on specific landmarks and transitioning between them, simultaneously segments demonstrated manipulations into sub-tasks. This study proposes a simple yet robust task decomposition method based on gaze transitions. Using teleoperation, a common modality in robotic manipulation for collecting demonstrations, in which a human operator's gaze is measured and used for task decomposition as a substitute for an imitating agent's gaze. Our approach ensures consistent task decomposition across all demonstrations for each task, which is desirable in contexts such as machine learning. We evaluated the method across demonstrations of various tasks, assessing the characteristics and consistency of the resulting sub-tasks. Furthermore, extensive testing across different hyperparameter settings confirmed its robustness, making it adaptable to diverse robotic systems.

However, developing universal AI architectures is extremely challenging due to the diversity in robot configurations and a lack of dataset. We proposed a universal architecture for the AI-ization of elderly care robots, called AoECR. Specifically, based on a nursing bed, we developed a patient-nurse interaction dataset tailored for elderly care scenarios and fine-tuned a large language model to enable it to perform nursing manipulations. Additionally, the inference process included a self-check chain to ensure the security of control commands. An expert optimization process further enhanced the humanization and personalization of the interactive responses. The physical experiment demonstrated that the AoECR exhibited zero-shot generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios, understood patients' instructions, implemented secure control commands, and delivered humanized and personalized interactive responses. In general, our research provides a valuable dataset reference and AI-ization solutions for elderly care robots.</p></details> | 11 pages |

However, robust perception and localization for snake robots remain an open challenge due to the proximity of the sensor payload to the ground coupled with a limited field of view. To address this issue, we propose Blind-motion with Intermittently Scheduled Scans (BLISS) which combines proprioception-only mobility with intermittent scans to be resilient against both localization failures and collision risks. BLISS is formulated as an integrated Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) problem that leads to a Chance-Constrained Hybrid Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (CC-HPOMDP), known to be computationally intractable due to the curse of history. Our novelty lies in reformulating CC-HPOMDP as a tractable, convex Mixed Integer Linear Program. This allows us to solve BLISS-TAMP significantly faster and jointly derive optimal task-motion plans. Simulations and hardware experiments on the EELS snake robot show our method achieves over an order of magnitude computational improvement compared to state-of-the-art POMDP planners and $>$ 50\% better navigation time optimality versus classical two-stage planners.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Autonomous Guidewire Navigation for Robot-assisted Endovascular Interventions: A Knowledge-Driven Visual Guidance Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05748v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robots for endovascular interventions hold significant potential to enhance procedural safety and reliability by navigating guidewires with precision, minimizing human error, and reducing surgical time. However, existing methods of guidewire navigation rely on manual demonstration data and have a suboptimal success rate. In this work, we propose a knowledge-driven visual guidance (KVG) method that leverages available visual information from interventional imaging to facilitate guidewire navigation. Our approach integrates image segmentation and detection techniques to extract surgical knowledge, including vascular maps and guidewire positions. We introduce BDA-star, a novel path planning algorithm with boundary distance constraints, to optimize trajectory planning for guidewire navigation. To validate the method, we developed the KVD-Reinforcement Learning environment, where observations consist of real-time guidewire feeding images highlighting the guidewire tip position and the planned path. We proposed a reward function based on the distances from both the guidewire tip to the planned path and the target to evaluate the agent's actions.Additionally, to address stability issues and slow convergence rates associated with direct learning from raw pixels, we incorporated a pre-trained convolutional neural network into the policy network for feature extraction. Experiments conducted on the aortic simulation autonomous guidewire navigation platform demonstrated that the proposed method, targeting the left subclavian artery, left carotid artery and the brachiocephalic artery, achieved a 100\% guidewire navigation success rate, along with reduced movement and retraction distances and trajectories tend to the center of the vessels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image-Based Roadmaps for Vision-Only Planning and Control of Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19617v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a motion planning framework for robotic manipulators that computes collision-free paths directly in image space. The generated paths can then be tracked using vision-based control, eliminating the need for an explicit robot model or proprioceptive sensing. At the core of our approach is the construction of a roadmap entirely in image space. To achieve this, we explicitly define sampling, nearest-neighbor selection, and collision checking based on visual features rather than geometric models. We first collect a set of image-space samples by moving the robot within its workspace, capturing keypoints along its body at different configurations. These samples serve as nodes in the roadmap, which we construct using either learned or predefined distance metrics. At runtime, the roadmap generates collision-free paths directly in image space, removing the need for a robot model or joint encoders. We validate our approach through an experimental study in which a robotic arm follows planned paths using an adaptive vision-based control scheme to avoid obstacles. The results show that paths generated with the learned-distance roadmap achieved 100% success in control convergence, whereas the predefined image-space distance roadmap enabled faster transient responses but had a lower success rate in convergence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hi Robot: Open-Ended Instruction Following with Hierarchical Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19417v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robots that can perform a range of different tasks in open-world settings must be able to not only reason about the steps needed to accomplish their goals, but also process complex instructions, prompts, and even feedback during task execution. Intricate instructions (e.g., "Could you make me a vegetarian sandwich?" or "I don't like that one") require not just the ability to physically perform the individual steps, but the ability to situate complex commands and feedback in the physical world. In this work, we describe a system that uses vision-language models in a hierarchical structure, first reasoning over complex prompts and user feedback to deduce the most appropriate next step to fulfill the task, and then performing that step with low-level actions. In contrast to direct instruction following methods that can fulfill simple commands ("pick up the cup"), our system can reason through complex prompts and incorporate situated feedback during task execution ("that's not trash"). We evaluate our system across three robotic platforms, including single-arm, dual-arm, and dual-arm mobile robots, demonstrating its ability to handle tasks such as cleaning messy tables, making sandwiches, and grocery shopping.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, how to enable robots to automatically plan trajectories for changing tasks presents a considerable challenge. Further complexities arise when robots operate within work cells alongside machines, humans, or other robots. This paper introduces a multi-level hybrid robot motion planning method combining a task space Reinforcement Learning-based Learning from Demonstration (RL-LfD) agent and a joint-space based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based agent. A higher level agent learns to switch between the two agents to enable feasible and smooth motion. The feasibility is computed by incorporating reachability, joint limits, manipulability, and collision risks of the robot in the given environment. Therefore, the derived hybrid motion planning policy generates a feasible trajectory that adheres to task constraints. The effectiveness of the method is validated through sim ulated robotic scenarios and in a real-world setup.</p></details> | 35 Pages, 11 Figures |

This issue is particularly pronounced when manipulating meter-scale objects or those with varying stiffness, as traditional gripping techniques and strategies frequently prove inadequate. In this letter, we introduce a novel surface-based multi-module robotic manipulation framework that utilizes a Central Pattern Generator (CPG)-based motion generator, combined with a simulation-based optimization method to determine the optimal manipulation parameters for a multi-module origami robotic surface (Ori-Pixel). This approach allows for the manipulation of objects ranging from centimeters to meters in size, with varying stiffness and shape. The optimized CPG parameters are tested through both dynamic simulations and a series of prototype experiments involving a wide range of objects differing in size, weight, shape, and material, demonstrating robust manipulation capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under revision for possible publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L).

However, the lack of suitable garden spaces, demanding daily schedules and limited gardening expertise present major roadblocks for citizens looking to engage in urban gardening. While prior research has explored smart home solutions to support urban gardeners, these approaches currently do not fully address these practical barriers. In this paper, we present PlantPal, a system that enables the cultivation of garden spaces irrespective of one's location, expertise level, or time constraints. PlantPal enables the shared operation of a precision agriculture robot (PAR) that is equipped with garden tools and a multi-camera system. Insights from a 3-week deployment (N=18) indicate that PlantPal facilitated the integration of gardening tasks into daily routines, fostered a sense of connection with one's field, and provided an engaging experience despite the remote setting. We contribute design considerations for future robot-assisted urban gardening concepts.</p></details> |  |

Although advances in deep learning have made it increasingly feasible to replicate the dexterity of human teleoperation in robots, generalizing these acquired skills to previously unseen scenarios remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm, Gaze-based Bottleneck-aware Robot Manipulation (GazeBot), which enables high reusability of the learned motions even when the object positions and end-effector poses differ from those in the provided demonstrations. By leveraging gaze information and motion bottlenecks, both crucial features for object manipulation, GazeBot achieves high generalization performance compared with state-of-the-art imitation learning methods, without sacrificing its dexterity and reactivity. Furthermore, the training process of GazeBot is entirely data-driven once a demonstration dataset with gaze data is provided.

As robots become more prevalent in workplaces, homes and public spaces, understanding how sounds produced by robots affect human-perceptions of these robots is becoming increasingly important to creating positive human robot interactions (HRI). This paper presents the results from 182 participants (858 trials) investigating how human-perception of robots is changed by consequential sounds. In a between-participants study, participants in the sound condition were shown 5 videos of different robots and asked their opinions on the robots and the sounds they made. This was compared to participants in the control condition who viewed silent videos. Consequential sounds correlated with significantly more negative perceptions of robots, including increased negative `associated affects', feeling more distracted, and being less willing to colocate in a shared environment with robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures - Accepted to be published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL).

| **[Enabling Multi-Robot Collaboration from Single-Human Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19831v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning collaborative behaviors is essential for multi-agent systems. Traditionally, multi-agent reinforcement learning solves this implicitly through a joint reward and centralized observations, assuming collaborative behavior will emerge. Other studies propose to learn from demonstrations of a group of collaborative experts. Instead, we propose an efficient and explicit way of learning collaborative behaviors in multi-agent systems by leveraging expertise from only a single human. Our insight is that humans can naturally take on various roles in a team. We show that agents can effectively learn to collaborate by allowing a human operator to dynamically switch between controlling agents for a short period and incorporating a human-like theory-of-mind model of teammates. Our experiments showed that our method improves the success rate of a challenging collaborative hide-and-seek task by up to 58% with only 40 minutes of human guidance. We further demonstrate our findings transfer to the real world by conducting multi-robot experiments.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel approach to modeling physical human-robot interaction in a physics-based simulator (MuJoCo) using soft-body dynamics. We integrate a flexible head model with a rigid skeleton while accounting for internal dynamics, enabling the flexible model to be actuated by the skeleton. Incorporating realistic soft-skin contact dynamics in simulation allows for systematically evaluating bite transfer parameters, such as insertion depth and entry angle, and their impact on user safety and comfort. Our findings suggest that a straight-in-straight-out strategy minimizes forces and enhances user comfort in robot-assisted feeding, assuming a static head. This simulation-based approach offers a safer and more controlled alternative to real-world experimentation.

As such, machine tending is a task collaborative robots can tackle that can also highly boost productivity. Nevertheless, existing robotics systems deployed in that sector rely on a fixed single-arm setup, whereas mobile robots can provide more flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce a multi-agent multi-machine tending learning framework by mobile robots based on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) techniques with the design of a suitable observation and reward. Moreover, an attention-based encoding mechanism is developed and integrated into Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to boost its performance for machine tending scenarios. Our model (AB-MAPPO) outperformed MAPPO in this new challenging scenario in terms of task success, safety, and resources utilization.

| **[CURE: Simulation-Augmented Auto-Tuning in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05399v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic systems are typically composed of various subsystems, such as localization and navigation, each encompassing numerous configurable components (e.g., selecting different planning algorithms). Once an algorithm has been selected for a component, its associated configuration options must be set to the appropriate values. Configuration options across the system stack interact non-trivially. Finding optimal configurations for highly configurable robots to achieve desired performance poses a significant challenge due to the interactions between configuration options across software and hardware that result in an exponentially large and complex configuration space. These challenges are further compounded by the need for transferability between different environments and robotic platforms. Data efficient optimization algorithms (e.g., Bayesian optimization) have been increasingly employed to automate the tuning of configurable parameters in cyber-physical systems. However, such optimization algorithms converge at later stages, often after exhausting the allocated budget (e.g., optimization steps, allotted time) and lacking transferability. This paper proposes CURE -- a method that identifies causally relevant configuration options, enabling the optimization process to operate in a reduced search space, thereby enabling faster optimization of robot performance. CURE abstracts the causal relationships between various configuration options and robot performance objectives by learning a causal model in the source (a low-cost environment such as the Gazebo simulator) and applying the learned knowledge to perform optimization in the target (e.g., Turtlebot 3 physical robot). We demonstrate the effectiveness and transferability of CURE by conducting experiments that involve varying degrees of deployment changes in both physical robots and simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2025</p></details> |

These surgical robots show promising capabilities; however, most of them have to limit their working volume to achieve maximum accuracy. Moreover, the visible area seen through the surgical microscope is limited and solely depends on the eye posture. If the eye posture, trocar position, and robot configuration are not correctly arranged, the instrument may not reach the target position, and the preparation will have to be redone. Therefore, this paper proposes the optimization framework of the eye tilting and the robot positioning to reach various target areas for different patients. Our method was validated with an adjustable phantom eye model, and the error of this workflow was 0.13 +/- 1.65 deg (rotational joint around Y axis), -1.40 +/- 1.13 deg (around X axis), and 1.80 +/- 1.51 mm (depth, Z). The potential error sources are also analyzed in the discussion section.</p></details> | Accepted to ICRA2025 |

When a robot lacks the necessary tools to accomplish a task requested by a human, it autonomously designs the required instruments and learns how to use them to achieve the goal. Evolution 6.0 is an autonomous robotic system powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Vision-Language Action (VLA) models, and Text-to-3D generative models for tool design and task execution. The system comprises two key modules: the Tool Generation Module, which fabricates task-specific tools from visual and textual data, and the Action Generation Module, which converts natural language instructions into robotic actions. It integrates QwenVLM for environmental understanding, OpenVLA for task execution, and Llama-Mesh for 3D tool generation. Evaluation results demonstrate a 90% success rate for tool generation with a 10-second inference time, and action generation achieving 83.5% in physical and visual generalization, 70% in motion generalization, and 37% in semantic generalization. Future improvements will focus on bimanual manipulation, expanded task capabilities, and enhanced environmental interpretation to improve real-world adaptability.</p></details> | Submitted to IROS |

While Behavior Trees (BTs) have been established as a popular control architecture and are plannable for a single robot, the development of effective multi-robot BT planning algorithms remains challenging due to the complexity of coordinating diverse action spaces. We propose the Multi-Robot Behavior Tree Planning (MRBTP) algorithm, with theoretical guarantees of both soundness and completeness. MRBTP features cross-tree expansion to coordinate heterogeneous actions across different BTs to achieve the team's goal. For homogeneous actions, we retain backup structures among BTs to ensure robustness and prevent redundant execution through intention sharing. While MRBTP is capable of generating BTs for both homogeneous and heterogeneous robot teams, its efficiency can be further improved. We then propose an optional plugin for MRBTP when Large Language Models (LLMs) are available to reason goal-related actions for each robot. These relevant actions can be pre-planned to form long-horizon subtrees, significantly enhancing the planning speed and collaboration efficiency of MRBTP. We evaluate our algorithm in warehouse management and everyday service scenarios. Results demonstrate MRBTP's robustness and execution efficiency under varying settings, as well as the ability of the pre-trained LLM to generate effective task-specific subtrees for MRBTP.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this advanced level of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), robots need to acquire and incorporate knowledge of their users' tasks and environment and adopt multimodal communication approaches with expressive cues that combine speech, movement, gazes, and other modalities. This paper presents several methods to design, enhance, and evaluate expressive HRI systems for non-humanoid industrial robots. We present the concept of a small anthropomorphic robot communicating as a proxy for its non-humanoid host, such as a forklift. We developed a multimodal and LLM-enhanced communication framework for this robot and evaluated it in several lab experiments, using gaze tracking and motion capture to quantify how users perceive the robot and measure the task progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 1st German Robotics Conference (GRC)</p></details> |

We present corobos, a proof-of-concept design that enables these robots to cooperatively transition between table (horizontal) and wall (vertical) surfaces seamlessly, without human intervention. Each robot is equipped with a uniquely designed slope structure that facilitates smooth rotation when another robot pushes it toward a target surface. Notably, this design relies solely on passive mechanical elements, eliminating the need for additional active electrical components. We investigated the design parameters of this structure and evaluated its transition success rate through experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate various application examples to showcase the potential of corobos in enhancing user environments.</p></details> | CHI 2025 |

Integrating a motorized LiDAR offers a practical solution by significantly expanding the sensor's FoV and enabling adaptive panoramic 3D sensing. However, the high-frequency vibrations of the quadruped robot introduce calibration challenges, causing variations in the LiDAR-motor transformation that degrade sensing accuracy. Existing calibration methods that use artificial targets or dense feature extraction lack feasibility for on-site applications and real-time implementation. To overcome these limitations, we propose LiMo-Calib, an efficient on-site calibration method that eliminates the need for external targets by leveraging geometric features directly from raw LiDAR scans. LiMo-Calib optimizes feature selection based on normal distribution to accelerate convergence while maintaining accuracy and incorporates a reweighting mechanism that evaluates local plane fitting quality to enhance robustness. We integrate and validate the proposed method on a motorized LiDAR system mounted on a quadruped robot, demonstrating significant improvements in calibration efficiency and 3D sensing accuracy, making LiMo-Calib well-suited for real-world robotic applications. We further demonstrate the accuracy improvements of the LIO on the panoramic 3D sensing system using the calibrated parameters. The code will be available at: https://github.com/kafeiyin00/LiMo-Calib.</p></details> |  |

While existing systems predominantly rely on software-based safety features to mitigate risks during unforeseen collisions, this study explores the use of a mechanical fail-safe to improve safety. We designed a breakaway utensil attachment that decouples forces exerted by the robot on the user when excessive forces occur. Finite element analysis (FEA) simulations were performed to predict failure points under various loading conditions, followed by experimental validation using 3D-printed attachments with variations in slot depth and wall loops. To facilitate testing, a drop test rig was developed and validated. Our results demonstrated a consistent failure point at the slot of the attachment, with a slot depth of 1 mm and three wall loops achieving failure at the target force of 65 N. Additionally, the parameters can be tailored to customize the breakaway force based on user-specific factors, such as comfort and pain tolerance.

Specifically, IBURD generates both images of underwater debris and their pixel-level annotations, using source images of debris objects, their annotations, and target background images of marine environments. With Poisson editing and style transfer techniques, IBURD is even able to robustly blend transparent objects into arbitrary backgrounds and automatically adjust the style of blended images using the blurriness metric of target background images. These generated images of marine debris in actual underwater backgrounds address the data scarcity and data variety problems faced by deep-learned vision algorithms in challenging underwater conditions, and can enable the use of AUVs for environmental cleanup missions. Both quantitative and robotic evaluations of IBURD demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for robotic detection of marine debris.</p></details> |  |

However, the data that such policies are trained on is generally of mixed quality -- not only are human-collected demonstrations unlikely to perform the task perfectly, but the larger the dataset is, the harder it is to curate only the highest quality examples. It also remains unclear how optimal data from one embodiment is for training on another embodiment. In this paper, we present a general and broadly applicable approach that enhances the performance of such generalist robot policies at deployment time by re-ranking their actions according to a value function learned via offline RL. This approach, which we call Value-Guided Policy Steering (V-GPS), is compatible with a wide range of different generalist policies, without needing to fine-tune or even access the weights of the policy. We show that the same value function can improve the performance of five different state-of-the-art policies with different architectures, even though they were trained on distinct datasets, attaining consistent performance improvement on multiple robotic platforms across a total of 12 tasks.

Many parents express concerns about content appropriateness, while they also value how AI and robots could supplement their limited skill, time, and energy to support their children's learning. We designed a card-based kit, SET, to systematically capture scenarios that have different extents of parental involvement. We developed a prototype interface, PAiREd, with a learning companion robot to deliver LLM-generated educational content that can be reviewed and revised by parents. Parents can flexibly adjust their involvement in the activity by determining what they want the robot to help with. We conducted an in-home field study involving 20 families with children aged 3-5. Our work contributes to an empirical understanding of the level of support parents with different expectations may need from AI and robots and a prototype that demonstrates an innovative interaction paradigm for flexibly including parents in supporting their children.</p></details> |  |

Cosserat Rod Theory has emerged as a prominent framework for modeling these robots efficiently, representing continuum soft robots as time-varying curves, known as backbones. In this work, we propose viewing the robot's backbone as a signal in space and time, applying the Fourier transform to describe its deformation compactly. This approach unifies existing modeling strategies within the Cosserat Rod Theory framework, offering insights into commonly used heuristic methods. Moreover, the Fourier transform enables the development of a data-driven methodology to experimentally capture the robot's deformation. The proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations and experiments on a real-world prototype, demonstrating a reduction in the degrees of freedom while preserving the accuracy of the deformation representation.</p></details> |  |

In general, feasible regions for accomplishing tasks within complex high-dimensional spaces are exceedingly narrow. For instance, in the context of humanoid robot motion control, the vast majority of space corresponds to falling, while only a minuscule fraction corresponds to standing upright, which is conducive to the completion of downstream tasks. Once the robot explores into a potentially task-relevant region, it should place greater emphasis on the data within that region. Building on this insight, we propose the $\textbf{S}$elf-$\textbf{I}$mitative $\textbf{R}$einforcement $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{SIRL}$) framework, where the RL algorithm also imitates potentially task-relevant trajectories. Specifically, trajectory return is utilized to determine its relevance to the task and an additional behavior cloning is adopted whose weight is dynamically adjusted based on the trajectory return. As a result, our proposed algorithm achieves 120% performance improvement on the challenging HumanoidBench with 5% extra computation overhead. With further visualization, we find the significant performance gain does lead to meaningful behavior improvement that several tasks are solved successfully.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we extend the concept of inverse kinematics to guiding vector fields for path following in autonomous mobile robots. The desired path is defined by its implicit equation, i.e., by a collection of points belonging to one or more zero-level sets. These level sets serve as a reference to construct an error signal that drives the guiding vector field toward the desired path, enabling the robot to converge and travel along the path by following such a vector field. We start with the formal exposition on how inverse kinematics can be applied to guiding vector fields for single-integrator robots in an m-dimensional Euclidean space. Then, we leverage inverse kinematics to ensure that the level-set error signal behaves as a linear system, facilitating control over the robot's transient motion toward the desired path and allowing for the injection of feed-forward signals to induce precise motion behavior along the path. We then propose solutions to the theoretical and practical challenges of applying this technique to unicycles with constant speeds to follow 2D paths with precise transient control. We finish by validating the predicted theoretical results through real flights with fixed-wing drones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Yu Zh...</summary><p>Yu Zhou and Jes\'us Bautista contributed equally to this work.

Mapping and navigation, as the key foundation for air-ground collaborative robots to achieve efficient task execution, have attracted a great deal of attention. This growing interest in collaborative robot mapping and navigation is conducive to improving the intelligence of fire and rescue task execution, but there has been no comprehensive investigation of this field to highlight their strengths. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the ground-to-ground cooperative robots for fire and rescue from a new perspective of mapping and navigation. First, an air-ground collaborative robots framework for fire and rescue missions based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mapping and unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation is introduced. Then, the research progress of mapping and navigation under this framework is systematically summarized, including UAV mapping, UAV/UGV co-localization, and UGV navigation, with their main achievements and limitations. Based on the needs of fire and rescue missions, the collaborative robots with different numbers of UAVs and UGVs are classified, and their practicality in fire and rescue tasks is elaborated, with a focus on the discussion of their merits and demerits. In addition, the application examples of air-ground collaborative robots in various firefighting and rescue scenarios are given. Finally, this paper emphasizes the current challenges and potential research opportunities, rounding up references for practitioners and researchers willing to engage in this vibrant area of air-ground collaborative robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 20 figures; This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Traditionally, robotic assembly planning problems have been solved using heuristics, but these methods are specific to a given objective structure or set of problem parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to robotic assembly planning that poses assembly sequencing as a sequential decision making problem, enabling us to harness methods that far outperform the state-of-the-art. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize Dynamic Programming (DP) to find optimal assembly policies for moderately sized strictures. We further expand our framework to exploit the deterministic nature of assembly planning and introduce a class of optimal Graph Exploration Assembly Planners (GEAPs). For larger structures, we show how Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables us to learn policies that generate high reward assembly sequences. We evaluate our approach on a variety of robotic assembly problems, such as the assembly of the Hubble Space Telescope, the International Space Station, and the James Webb Space Telescope. We further showcase how our DP, GEAP, and RL implementations are capable of finding optimal solutions under a variety of different objective functions and how our formulation allows us to translate precedence constraints to branch pruning and thus further improve performance.

Detecting and recovering from these failures is crucial for maintaining effective level of trust from users. However, robots may fail without being aware of it. One way to detect such failures could be by analysing humans' non-verbal behaviours and reactions to failures. This study investigates how human gaze dynamics can signal a robot's failure and examines how different types of failures affect people's perception of robot. We conducted a user study with 27 participants collaborating with a robotic mobile manipulator to solve tangram puzzles. The robot was programmed to experience two types of failures -- executional and decisional -- occurring either at the beginning or end of the task, with or without acknowledgement of the failure. Our findings reveal that the type and timing of the robot's failure significantly affect participants' gaze behaviour and perception of the robot. Specifically, executional failures led to more gaze shifts and increased focus on the robot, while decisional failures resulted in lower entropy in gaze transitions among areas of interest, particularly when the failure occurred at the end of the task. These results highlight that gaze can serve as a reliable indicator of robot failures and their types, and could also be used to predict the appropriate recovery actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>this ...</summary><p>this paper is accepted in HRI conference as a full paper</p></details> |
| **[Variations of Augmented Lagrangian for Robotic Multi-Contact Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16898v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multi-contact nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) is a naturally arising challenge in robotic simulations. Achieving high performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency remains a significant challenge, particularly in scenarios involving intensive contacts and stiff interactions. In this article, we introduce a new class of multi-contact NCP solvers based on the theory of the Augmented Lagrangian (AL). We detail how the standard derivation of AL in convex optimization can be adapted to handle multi-contact NCP through the iteration of surrogate problem solutions and the subsequent update of primal-dual variables. Specifically, we present two tailored variations of AL for robotic simulations: the Cascaded Newton-based Augmented Lagrangian (CANAL) and the Subsystem-based Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (SubADMM). We demonstrate how CANAL can manage multi-contact NCP in an accurate and robust manner, while SubADMM offers superior computational speed, scalability, and parallelizability for high degrees-of-freedom multibody systems with numerous contacts. Our results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed solver framework, illustrating its advantages in various robotic manipulation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for Chattering-Free Trajectory Tracking of Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16867v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise and efficient trajectory tracking in robotic arms remains a key challenge due to system uncertainties and chattering effects in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

The approach formulates the optimization problem to minimize the sum of residuals between actual and predicted states parameterized by the friction coefficient in rigid body contact dynamics. Notably, the proposed framework leverages the analytic smoothed gradient of contact impulses, obtained by smoothing the complementarity condition of Coulomb friction, to solve the issue of non-informative gradients induced from the nonsmooth contact dynamics. Moreover, we introduce the rejection method to filter out data with high normal contact velocity following contact initiations during friction coefficient identification for legged robots. To validate the proposed framework, we conduct the experiments using a quadrupedal robot platform, KAIST HOUND, on slippery and nonslippery terrain. We observe that our framework achieves fast and consistent friction coefficient identification within various initial conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, IEEE RA-L (2025) accepted</p></details> |

However, existing datasets primarily focus on elementary tasks like object pointing and pushing, limiting their applicability to complex domains. They prioritize simpler human command data but place less emphasis on training robots to correctly interpret tasks and respond appropriately. To address these gaps, we present the NatSGLD dataset, which was collected using a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) method, where participants interacted with a robot they believed to be autonomous. NatSGLD records humans' multimodal commands (speech and gestures), each paired with a demonstration trajectory and a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula that provides a ground-truth interpretation of the commanded tasks. This dataset serves as a foundational resource for research at the intersection of HRI and machine learning. By providing multimodal inputs and detailed annotations, NatSGLD enables exploration in areas such as multimodal instruction following, plan recognition, and human-advisable reinforcement learning from demonstrations. We release the dataset and code under the MIT License at https://www.snehesh.com/natsgld/ to support future HRI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2403.02274</p></details> |
| **[Reflective Planning: Vision-Language Models for Multi-Stage Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16707v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving complex long-horizon robotic manipulation problems requires sophisticated high-level planning capabilities, the ability to reason about the physical world, and reactively choose appropriate motor skills. Vision-language models (VLMs) pretrained on Internet data could in principle offer a framework for tackling such problems. However, in their current form, VLMs lack both the nuanced understanding of intricate physics required for robotic manipulation and the ability to reason over long horizons to address error compounding issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time computation framework that enhances VLMs' physical reasoning capabilities for multi-stage manipulation tasks. At its core, our approach iteratively improves a pretrained VLM with a "reflection" mechanism - it uses a generative model to imagine future world states, leverages these predictions to guide action selection, and critically reflects on potential suboptimalities to refine its reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art commercial VLMs as well as other post-training approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

| **[Phase-Independent Dynamic Movement Primitives With Applications to Human-Robot Co-manipulation and Time Optimal Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08238v3)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) are an established and efficient method for encoding robotic tasks that require adaptation based on reference motions. Typically, the nominal trajectory is obtained through Programming by Demonstration (PbD), where the robot learns a task via kinesthetic guidance and reproduces it in terms of both geometric path and timing law. Modifying the duration of the execution in standard DMPs is achieved by adjusting a time constant in the model. This paper introduces a novel approach to fully decouple the geometric information of a task from its temporal information using an algorithm called spatial sampling, which allows parameterizing the demonstrated curve by its arc-length. This leads to the definition of the Geometric DMP (GDMP). The proposed spatial sampling algorithm guarantees the regularity of the demonstrated curve and ensures a consistent projection of the human force throughout the task in a human-in-the-loop scenario. GDMP exhibits phase independence, as its phase variable is no longer constrained to the demonstration's timing law, enabling a wide range of applications, including phase optimization problems and human-in-the-loop applications. Firstly, a minimum task duration optimization problem subject to velocity and acceleration constraints is formulated. The decoupling of path and speed in GDMP allows to achieve optimal time duration without violating the constraints. Secondly, GDMP is validated in a human-in-the-loop application, providing a theoretical passivity analysis and an experimental stability evaluation in co-manipulation tasks. Finally, GDMP is compared with other DMP architectures available in the literature, both for the phase optimization problem and experimentally with reference to an insertion task, showcasing the enhanced performance of GDMP with respect to other solutions.</p></details> | 18 pages, 18 figures |

Existing work often overlooks the differences between humans and robots, producing unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we study how perfectly aligned human-robot pairs benefit robot learning. Capitalizing on VR-based teleportation, we introduce H\&R, a third-person dataset with 2,600 episodes, each of which captures the fine-grained correspondence between human hands and robot gripper. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models, we introduce Human2Robot, an end-to-end diffusion framework that formulates learning from human demonstrates as a generative task. Human2Robot fully explores temporal dynamics in human videos to generate robot videos and predict actions at the same time. Through comprehensive evaluations of 8 seen, changed and unseen tasks in real-world settings, we demonstrate that Human2Robot can not only generate high-quality robot videos but also excel in seen tasks and generalize to unseen objects, backgrounds and even new tasks effortlessly.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, studying vision-based underwater robot navigation and control has recently gained increasing attention to counter the numerous challenges faced in underwater conditions, such as lighting variability, turbidity, camera image distortions (due to bubbles), and ROV positional disturbances (due to underwater currents). In this paper, we propose (to the best of our knowledge) a first rigorous unified benchmarking of more than seven Machine Learning (ML)-based one-shot object tracking algorithms for vision-based position locking of ROV platforms. We propose a position-locking system that processes images of an object of interest in front of which the ROV must be kept stable. Then, our proposed system uses the output result of different object tracking algorithms to automatically correct the position of the ROV against external disturbances. We conducted numerous real-world experiments using a BlueROV2 platform within an indoor pool and provided clear demonstrations of the strengths and weaknesses of each tracking approach. Finally, to help alleviate the scarcity of underwater ROV data, we release our acquired data base as open-source with the hope of benefiting future research.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements have explored diverse reward function designs, training techniques, simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfers, and performance analysis methodologies, yet these still require significant human intervention. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for training and deploying RL policies, guided by Large Language Models (LLMs), and evaluates its effectiveness on bipedal robots. The framework consists of three interconnected modules: an LLM-guided reward function design module, an RL training module leveraging prior work, and a sim-to-real homomorphic evaluation module. This design significantly reduces the need for human input by utilizing only essential simulation and deployment platforms, with the option to incorporate human-engineered strategies and historical data. We detail the construction of these modules, their advantages over traditional approaches, and demonstrate the framework's capability to autonomously develop and refine controlling strategies for bipedal robot locomotion, showcasing its potential to operate independently of human intervention.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods predominantly schedule robots' movements based on reactive stimuli or simplified gas plume models. These approaches typically excel in idealized, simulated environments but fall short in real-world gas environments characterized by their patchy distribution. In this work, we introduce SniffySquad, a multi-robot olfaction-based system designed to address the inherent patchiness in gas source localization. SniffySquad incorporates a patchiness-aware active sensing approach that enhances the quality of data collection and estimation. Moreover, it features an innovative collaborative role adaptation strategy to boost the efficiency of source-seeking endeavors. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves an increase in the success rate by $20\%+$ and an improvement in path efficiency by $30\%+$, outperforming state-of-the-art gas source localization solutions.</p></details> |  |

However, recent Sim2real methods either rely on a large amount of augmented data or large learning models, which is inefficient for specific tasks. In recent years, with the emergence of radiance field reconstruction methods, especially 3D Gaussian splatting, it has become possible to construct realistic real-world scenes. To this end, we propose RL-GSBridge, a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework which incorporates 3D Gaussian Splatting into the conventional RL simulation pipeline, enabling zero-shot sim-to-real transfer for vision-based deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a mesh-based 3D GS method with soft binding constraints, enhancing the rendering quality of mesh models. Then utilizing a GS editing approach to synchronize the rendering with the physics simulator, RL-GSBridge could reflect the visual interactions of the physical robot accurately. Through a series of sim-to-real experiments, including grasping and pick-and-place tasks, we demonstrate that RL-GSBridge maintains a satisfactory success rate in real-world task completion during sim-to-real transfer. Furthermore, a series of rendering metrics and visualization results indicate that our proposed mesh-based 3D GS reduces artifacts in unstructured objects, demonstrating more realistic rendering performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

In this work, we examined impressions of social robots and VAs at the beginning and end of an eight-week study in which older adults interacted with these systems independently in their homes. Using a between-subjects design, participants could choose which interface to evaluate during the study.

However, its deployment on physical robots remains challenging due to safety risks and the comparatively high costs of training. To avoid these problems, RL agents are often trained on simulators, which introduces a new problem related to the gap between simulation and reality. This paper presents an RL pipeline designed to help reduce the reality gap and facilitate developing and deploying RL policies for real-world robotic systems. The pipeline organizes the RL training process into an initial step for system identification and three training stages: core simulation training, high-fidelity simulation, and real-world deployment, each adding levels of realism to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Each training stage takes an input policy, improves it, and either passes the improved policy to the next stage or loops it back for further improvement. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves the desired performance. The pipeline's effectiveness is shown through a case study with the Boston Dynamics Spot mobile robot used in a surveillance application. The case study presents the steps taken at each pipeline stage to obtain an RL agent to control the robot's position and orientation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to be presented at IEEE SysCon 2025</p></details> |

Acting relies on skills to implement and to model the activities it oversees: refinement, local recovery, temporal dispatching, external asynchronous events, and commands execution, all done online. While sitting between planning and the robotic platform, acting often relies on programming primitives and an interpreter which executes these skills. Following our experience in providing a formal framework to program the functional components of our robots, we propose a new language, to program the acting skills. This language maps unequivocally into a formal model which can then be used to check properties offline or execute the skills, or more precisely their formal equivalent, and perform runtime verification. We illustrate with a real example how we can program a survey mission for a drone in this new language, prove some formal properties on the program and directly execute the formal model on the drone to perform the mission.</p></details> |  |

This collaborative learning in real-world environments requires social robots to adapt dynamically to changing and unpredictable situations and varying task settings. Our work contributes to addressing these challenges by exploring a simulated living room environment where robots need to learn the social appropriateness of their actions. First, we propose Federated Root (FedRoot) averaging, a novel weight aggregation strategy which disentangles feature learning across clients from individual task-based learning. Second, to adapt to challenging environments, we extend FedRoot to Federated Latent Generative Replay (FedLGR), a novel Federated Continual Learning (FCL) strategy that uses FedRoot-based weight aggregation and embeds each client with a generator model for pseudo-rehearsal of learnt feature embeddings to mitigate forgetting in a resource-efficient manner. Our results show that FedRoot-based methods offer competitive performance while also resulting in a sizeable reduction in resource consumption (up to 86% for CPU usage and up to 72% for GPU usage). Additionally, our results demonstrate that FedRoot-based FCL methods outperform other methods while also offering an efficient solution (up to 84% CPU and 92% GPU usage reduction), with FedLGR providing the best results across evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, IEEE RA-L submission</p></details> |

In robotics, microvibrations have traditionally been interpreted as a marker for object slip, and recently as a salient indicator of extrinsic contact. We present the first-ever robotic fingertip making use of SMI for slip and extrinsic contact sensing. The design is validated through measurement of controlled vibration sources, both before and after encasing the readout circuit in its fingertip package. Then, the SMI fingertip is compared to acoustic sensing through three experiments. The results are distilled into a technology decision map. SMI was found to be more sensitive to subtle slip events and significantly more robust against ambient noise.

In this work, we introduce a hybrid control scheme that combines the advantages of active and passive interaction control. To accomplish this, we propose the design of a novel Active Remote Center of Compliance (ARCC), which is based on a passive and active element which can be used to directly control the interaction forces. We introduce surrogate models for a dynamic comparison against purely robot-based interaction schemes. In a comparative validation, ARCC drastically improves the interaction dynamics, leading to an increase in the motion bandwidth of up to 31 times. We introduce further our control approach as well as the integration in the robot controller. Finally, we analyze ARCC on different industrial benchmarks like peg-in-hole, top-hat rail assembly and contour following problems and compare it against the state of the art, to highlight the dynamic and flexibility. The proposed system is especially suited if the application requires a low cycle time combined with a sensitive manipulation.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

Why can't large language models replicate this holistic understanding? Through a systematic analysis of existing training paradigms in vision-language-action models (VLA), we identify two key challenges: spurious forgetting, where robot training overwrites crucial visual-text alignments, and task interference, where competing control and understanding tasks degrade performance when trained jointly. To overcome these limitations, we propose ChatVLA, a novel framework featuring Phased Alignment Training, which incrementally integrates multimodal data after initial control mastery, and a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to minimize task interference. ChatVLA demonstrates competitive performance on visual question-answering datasets and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) methods on multimodal understanding benchmarks. Notably, it achieves a six times higher performance on MMMU and scores 47.2% on MMStar with a more parameter-efficient design than ECoT. Furthermore, ChatVLA demonstrates superior performance on 25 real-world robot manipulation tasks compared to existing VLA methods like OpenVLA. Our findings highlight the potential of our unified framework for achieving both robust multimodal understanding and effective robot control.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLAS: Vision-Language-Action Model With Speech Instructions For Customized Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13508v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have become increasingly popular in robot manipulation for their end-to-end design and remarkable performance. However, existing VLAs rely heavily on vision-language models (VLMs) that only support text-based instructions, neglecting the more natural speech modality for human-robot interaction. Traditional speech integration methods usually involves a separate speech recognition system, which complicates the model and introduces error propagation. Moreover, the transcription procedure would lose non-semantic information in the raw speech, such as voiceprint, which may be crucial for robots to successfully complete customized tasks. To overcome above challenges, we propose VLAS, a novel end-to-end VLA that integrates speech recognition directly into the robot policy model. VLAS allows the robot to understand spoken commands through inner speech-text alignment and produces corresponding actions to fulfill the task. We also present two new datasets, SQA and CSI, to support a three-stage tuning process for speech instructions, which empowers VLAS with the ability of multimodal interaction across text, image, speech, and robot actions. Taking a step further, a voice retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm is designed to enable our model to effectively handle tasks that require individual-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments show that VLAS can effectively accomplish robot manipulation tasks with diverse speech commands, offering a seamless and customized interaction experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This paper studies the multi-robot navigation problem in unknown environments with line-of-sight (LoS) connectivity constraints. While previous works are limited to known environment models to derive the LoS constraints, this paper eliminates such requirements by directly formulating the LoS constraints between robots from their real-time point cloud measurements, leveraging point cloud visibility analysis techniques. We propose a novel LoS-distance metric to quantify both the urgency and sensitivity of losing LoS between robots considering potential robot movements. Moreover, to address the imbalanced urgency of losing LoS between two robots, we design a fusion function to capture the overall urgency while generating gradients that facilitate robots' collaborative movement to maintain LoS. The LoS constraints are encoded into a potential function that preserves the positivity of the Fiedler eigenvalue of the robots' network graph to ensure connectivity. Finally, we establish a LoS-constrained exploration framework that integrates the proposed connectivity controller. We showcase its applications in multi-robot exploration in complex unknown environments, where robots can always maintain the LoS connectivity through distributed sensing and communication, while collaboratively mapping the unknown environment. The implementations are open-sourced at https://github.com/bairuofei/LoS_constrained_navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, accepted by IEEE ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Synergistic Framework for Learning Shape Estimation and Shape-Aware Whole-Body Control Policy for Continuum Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03859v4)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel synergistic framework for learning shape estimation and a shape-aware whole-body control policy for tendon-driven continuum robots. Our approach leverages the interaction between two Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ANODEs) -- the Shape-NODE and Control-NODE -- to achieve continuous shape estimation and shape-aware control. The Shape-NODE integrates prior knowledge from Cosserat rod theory, allowing it to adapt and account for model mismatches, while the Control-NODE uses this shape information to optimize a whole-body control policy, trained in a Model Predictive Control (MPC) fashion. This unified framework effectively overcomes limitations of existing data-driven methods, such as poor shape awareness and challenges in capturing complex nonlinear dynamics. Extensive evaluations in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the framework's robust performance in shape estimation, trajectory tracking, and obstacle avoidance. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art end-to-end, Neural-ODE, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, particularly in terms of tracking accuracy and generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[A novel step-by-step procedure for the kinematic calibration of robots using a single draw-wire encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14983v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot positioning accuracy is a key factory when performing high-precision manufacturing tasks. To effectively improve the accuracy of a manipulator, often up to a value close to its repeatability, calibration plays a crucial role. In the literature, various approaches to robot calibration have been proposed, and they range considerably in the type of measurement system and identification algorithm used. Our aim was to develop a novel step-by-step kinematic calibration procedure - where the parameters are subsequently estimated one at a time - that only uses 1D distance measurement data obtained through a draw-wire encoder. To pursue this objective, we derived an analytical approach to find, for each unknown parameter, a set of calibration points where the discrepancy between the measured and predicted distances only depends on that unknown parameter. This reduces the computational burden of the identification process while potentially improving its accuracy. Simulations and experimental tests were carried out on a 6 degrees-of-freedom robot arm: the results confirmed the validity of the proposed strategy. As a result, the proposed step-by-step calibration approach represents a practical, cost-effective and computationally less demanding alternative to standard calibration approaches, making robot calibration more accessible and easier to perform.</p></details> |  |

The architecture and connectivity of the MI-HGNN are constructed from the robot morphology, in which nodes and edges are robot joints and links, respectively. By incorporating the morphology-informed constraints into a neural network, we improve a learning-based approach using model-based knowledge. We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness, generalization ability, model efficiency, and sample efficiency. Our MI-HGNN improved the performance of a state-of-the-art model that leverages robot morphological symmetry by 8.4% with only 0.21% of its parameters. Although MI-HGNN is applied to contact perception problems for legged robots in this work, it can be seamlessly applied to other types of multi-body dynamical systems and has the potential to improve other robot learning frameworks.

Both avenues have, however, shown their limitations; the former lacks structure and performs poorly outside training data, while the latter requires significant simplifications and extensive expert knowledge to be used in practice. This paper introduces a streamlined method for learning low-dimensional, physics-based models that are both accurate and easy to interpret. We start with an algorithm that uses image data (i.e., shape evolutions) to determine the minimal necessary segments for describing a soft robot's movement. Following this, we apply a dynamic regression and strain sparsification algorithm to identify relevant strains and define the model's dynamics. We validate our approach through simulations with various planar soft manipulators, comparing its performance against other learning strategies, showing that our models are both computationally efficient and 25x more accurate on out-of-training distribution inputs. Finally, we demonstrate that thanks to the capability of the method of generating physically compatible models, the learned models can be straightforwardly combined with model-based control policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, appearing in Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE 8th International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)</p></details> |

To harness its advantages in robotics, it is crucial to solve these large and challenging optimization problems efficiently. To tackle this, we (i) develop a multiple shooting solver that exploits both temporal and parametric structures through a parametrized Riccati recursion. Additionally, we (ii) propose an inertial manifold that ensures the full physical consistency of inertial parameters and enhances convergence. To handle its manifold singularities, we (iii) introduce a nullspace approach in our optimal estimation solver. Finally, we (iv) develop the analytical derivatives of contact dynamics for both inertial parametrizations. Our framework can successfully solve estimation problems for complex maneuvers such as brachiation in humanoids, achieving higher accuracy than conventional least squares approaches. We demonstrate its numerical capabilities across various robotics tasks and its benefits in experimental trials with the Go1 robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mobile Robotic Approach to Autonomous Surface Scanning in Legal Medicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14514v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Comprehensive legal medicine documentation includes both an internal but also an external examination of the corpse. Typically, this documentation is conducted manually during conventional autopsy. A systematic digital documentation would be desirable, especially for the external examination of wounds, which is becoming more relevant for legal medicine analysis. For this purpose, RGB surface scanning has been introduced. While a manual full surface scan using a handheld camera is timeconsuming and operator dependent, floor or ceiling mounted robotic systems require substantial space and a dedicated room. Hence, we consider whether a mobile robotic system can be used for external documentation. Methods: We develop a mobile robotic system that enables full-body RGB-D surface scanning. Our work includes a detailed configuration space analysis to identify the environmental parameters that need to be considered to successfully perform a surface scan. We validate our findings through an experimental study in the lab and demonstrate the system's application in a legal medicine environment. Results: Our configuration space analysis shows that a good trade-off between coverage and time is reached with three robot base positions, leading to a coverage of 94.96 %. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the system in accurately capturing body surface geometry with an average surface coverage of 96.90 +- 3.16 % and 92.45 +- 1.43 % for a body phantom and actual corpses, respectively. Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of a mobile robotic system to automate RGB-D surface scanning in legal medicine, complementing the use of post-mortem CT scans for inner documentation. Our results indicate that the proposed system can contribute to more efficient and autonomous legal medicine documentation, reducing the need for manual intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and accepted for presentation at CARS 2025.

| **[A Large Recurrent Action Model: xLSTM enables Fast Inference for Robotics Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22391v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been a trend in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) towards large action models trained offline on large-scale datasets via sequence modeling. Existing models are primarily based on the Transformer architecture, which result in powerful agents. However, due to slow inference times, Transformer-based approaches are impractical for real-time applications, such as robotics. Recently, modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have been proposed that exhibit parallelization benefits during training similar to the Transformer architecture while offering fast inference. In this work, we study the aptitude of these modern recurrent architectures for large action models. Consequently, we propose a Large Recurrent Action Model (LRAM) with an xLSTM at its core that comes with linear-time inference complexity and natural sequence length extrapolation abilities. Experiments on 432 tasks from 6 domains show that LRAM compares favorably to Transformers in terms of performance and speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Learning Control Framework With Sim-to-Real for String-Type Artificial Muscle-Driven Robotic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10576v3)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic systems driven by artificial muscles present unique challenges due to the nonlinear dynamics of actuators and the complex designs of mechanical structures. Traditional model-based controllers often struggle to achieve desired control performance in such systems. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a trending machine learning technique widely adopted in robot control, offers a promising alternative. However, integrating DRL into these robotic systems faces significant challenges, including the requirement for large amounts of training data and the inevitable sim-to-real gap when deployed to real-world robots. This paper proposes an efficient reinforcement learning control framework with sim-to-real transfer to address these challenges. Bootstrap and augmentation enhancements are designed to improve the data efficiency of baseline DRL algorithms, while a sim-to-real transfer technique, namely randomization of muscle dynamics, is adopted to bridge the gap between simulation and real-world deployment. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted utilizing two string-type artificial muscle-driven robotic systems including a two degree-of-freedom robotic eye and a parallel robotic wrist, the results of which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed learning control strategy.</p></details> |  |

In human-robot interaction, implicit communication holds the potential to enhance robots' understanding of human needs, emotions, and intentions. This paper introduces a method to foster implicit communication in HRI without explicitly modelling human intentions or relying on pre-existing knowledge. Leveraging Transfer Entropy, we modulate influence between agents in social interactions in scenarios involving either collaboration or competition. By integrating influence into agents' rewards within a partially observable Markov decision process, we demonstrate that boosting influence enhances collaboration, while resisting influence diminishes performance. Our findings are validated through simulations and real-world experiments with human participants in social navigation settings.</p></details> | Preprint |

We propose dSLAP, a distributed safe learning and planning framework that allows the robots to safely navigate through the environments by coupling online learning and motion planning. Gaussian process regression is used to online learn the disturbances with uncertainty quantification. The planning algorithm ensures collision avoidance against the learning uncertainty and utilizes set-valued analysis to achieve fast adaptation in response to the newly learned models. A set-valued model predictive control problem is then formulated and solved to return a control policy that balances between actively exploring the unknown disturbances and reaching goal regions. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the safety of the robots in the absence of backup policy. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted for evaluation.</p></details> |  |

The HVS system combines Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) with Deep Learning-Based Visual Servoing (DLBVS) to overcome the limitations of each method and improve overall performance. IBVS offers higher accuracy and faster convergence in feature-rich environments, while DLBVS enhances robustness against disturbances and offers a larger workspace. By enabling smooth transitions between IBVS and DLBVS, the proposed HVS ensures effective control in dynamic, unstructured environments. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating that HVS achieves reduced iteration time, faster convergence, lower final error, and smoother performance compared to DLBVS alone, while maintaining DLBVS's robustness in challenging conditions such as occlusions, lighting changes, actuator noise, and physical impacts.</p></details> |  |

Tactile sensors like the BioTac mimic human fingertips and provide detailed interaction data. Despite its utility in applications like slip detection and object identification, this sensor is now deprecated, making many valuable datasets obsolete. However, recreating similar datasets with newer sensor technologies is both tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, adapting these existing datasets for use with new setups and modalities is crucial. In response, we introduce ACROSS, a novel framework for translating data between tactile sensors by exploiting sensor deformation information. We demonstrate the approach by translating BioTac signals into the DIGIT sensor. Our framework consists of first converting the input signals into 3D deformation meshes. We then transition from the 3D deformation mesh of one sensor to the mesh of another, and finally convert the generated 3D deformation mesh into the corresponding output space. We demonstrate our approach to the most challenging problem of going from a low-dimensional tactile representation to a high-dimensional one. In particular, we transfer the tactile signals of a BioTac sensor to DIGIT tactile images. Our approach enables the continued use of valuable datasets and data exchange between groups with different setups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 IEEE Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2025). arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.14310</p></details> |
| **[Soft Synergies: Model Order Reduction of Hybrid Soft-Rigid Robots via Optimal Strain Parameterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12959v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots offer remarkable adaptability and safety advantages over rigid robots, but modeling their complex, nonlinear dynamics remains challenging. Strain-based models have recently emerged as a promising candidate to describe such systems, however, they tend to be high-dimensional and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel model order reduction approach for soft and hybrid robots by combining strain-based modeling with Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). The method identifies optimal coupled strain basis functions -- or mechanical synergies -- from simulation data, enabling the description of soft robot configurations with a minimal number of generalized coordinates. The reduced order model (ROM) achieves substantial dimensionality reduction in the configuration space while preserving accuracy. Rigorous testing demonstrates the interpolation and extrapolation capabilities of the ROM for soft manipulators under static and dynamic conditions. The approach is further validated on a snake-like hyper-redundant rigid manipulator and a closed-chain system with soft and rigid components, illustrating its broad applicability. Moreover, the approach is leveraged for shape estimation of a real six-actuator soft manipulator using only two position markers, showcasing its practical utility. Finally, the ROM's dynamic and static behavior is validated experimentally against a parallel hybrid soft-rigid system, highlighting its effectiveness in representing the High-Order Model (HOM) and the real system. This POD-based ROM offers significant computational speed-ups, paving the way for real-time simulation and control of complex soft and hybrid robots.</p></details> |  |

Enabling robots to develop proficiency in human collaboration skills can facilitate more efficient human-robot collaboration (HRC). This paper introduces an innovative impedance regulation skill learning framework for achieving HRC in multiple physical collaborative tasks. The framework is designed to adjust the robot compliance to the human partner states while adhering to reference trajectories provided by human-human demonstrations. Specifically, electromyography (EMG) signals from human muscles are collected and analyzed to extract limb impedance, representing compliance behaviors during demonstrations. Human endpoint motions are captured and represented using a probabilistic learning method to create reference trajectories and corresponding impedance profiles. Meanwhile, an LSTMbased module is implemented to develop task-oriented impedance regulation policies by mapping the muscle synergistic contributions between two demonstrators. Finally, we propose a wholebody impedance controller for a human-like robot, coordinating joint outputs to achieve the desired impedance and reference trajectory during task execution. Experimental validation was conducted through a collaborative transportation task and two interactive Tai Chi pushing hands tasks, demonstrating superior performance from the perspective of interactive forces compared to a constant impedance control method.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |
| **[A Framework for Semantics-based Situational Awareness during Mobile Robot Deployments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13677v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deployment of robots into hazardous environments typically involves a ``Human-Robot Teaming'' (HRT) paradigm, in which a human supervisor interacts with a remotely operating robot inside the hazardous zone. Situational Awareness (SA) is vital for enabling HRT, to support navigation, planning, and decision-making. This paper explores issues of higher-level ``semantic'' information and understanding in SA. In semi-autonomous, or variable-autonomy paradigms, different types of semantic information may be important, in different ways, for both the human operator and an autonomous agent controlling the robot. We propose a generalizable framework for acquiring and combining multiple modalities of semantic-level SA during remote deployments of mobile robots. We demonstrate the framework with an example application of search and rescue (SAR) in disaster response robotics. We propose a set of ``environment semantic indicators" that can reflect a variety of different types of semantic information, e.g. indicators of risk, or signs of human activity, as the robot encounters different scenes. Based on these indicators, we propose a metric to describe the overall situation of the environment called ``Situational Semantic Richness (SSR)". This metric combines multiple semantic indicators to summarise the overall situation. The SSR indicates if an information-rich and complex situation has been encountered, which may require advanced reasoning for robots and humans and hence the attention of the expert human operator. The framework is tested on a Jackal robot in a mock-up disaster response environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic indicators are sensitive to changes in different modalities of semantic information in different scenes, and the SSR metric reflects overall semantic changes in the situations encountered.</p></details> |  |

Current benchmarks predominantly focus on urban terrains, specifically for on-road autonomous driving, leaving multi-degraded, densely vegetated, dynamic and feature-sparse environments, such as underground tunnels, natural fields, and modern indoor spaces underrepresented. To fill this gap, we introduce EnvoDat, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset collected in diverse environments and conditions, including high illumination, fog, rain, and zero visibility at different times of the day. Overall, EnvoDat contains 26 sequences from 13 scenes, 10 sensing modalities, over 1.9TB of data, and over 89K fine-grained polygon-based annotations for more than 82 object and terrain classes. We post-processed EnvoDat in different formats that support benchmarking SLAM and supervised learning algorithms, and fine-tuning multimodal vision models. With EnvoDat, we contribute to environment-resilient robotic autonomy in areas where the conditions are extremely challenging.

| **[Reinforcement Learning of Multi-robot Task Allocation for Multi-object Transportation with Infeasible Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11817v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object transport using multi-robot systems has the potential for diverse practical applications such as delivery services owing to its efficient individual and scalable cooperative transport. However, allocating transportation tasks of objects with unknown weights remains challenging. Moreover, the presence of infeasible tasks (untransportable objects) can lead to robot stoppage (deadlock). This paper proposes a framework for dynamic task allocation that involves storing task experiences for each task in a scalable manner with respect to the number of robots. First, these experiences are broadcasted from the cloud server to the entire robot system. Subsequently, each robot learns the exclusion levels for each task based on those task experiences, enabling it to exclude infeasible tasks and reset its task priorities. Finally, individual transportation, cooperative transportation, and the temporary exclusion of tasks considered infeasible are achieved. The scalability and versatility of the proposed method were confirmed through numerical experiments with an increased number of robots and objects, including unlearned weight objects. The effectiveness of the temporary deadlock avoidance was also confirmed by introducing additional robots within an episode. The proposed method enables the implementation of task allocation strategies that are feasible for different numbers of robots and various transport tasks without prior consideration of feasibility.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |

Existing solutions often address box size variations, but overlook their intrinsic and physical properties, such as density and rigidity, which are crucial for real-world applications. We use reinforcement learning (RL) to solve this problem by employing action space masking to direct the RL policy toward valid actions. Unlike previous methods that rely on heuristic stability assessments which are difficult to assess in physical scenarios, our framework utilizes online learning to dynamically train the action space mask, eliminating the need for manual heuristic design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, we deploy our learned task planner in a real-world robotic palletizer, validating its practical applicability in operational settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

The reliance on specialized expertise in robot control and teleoperation systems often limits accessibility to non-experts. We posit that natural language offers an intuitive and accessible interface for robot learning. To this end, we study two aspects: (1) enabling non-experts to collect robotic data through natural language supervision (e.g., "move the arm to the right") and (2) learning robotic policies directly from this supervision. Specifically, we introduce a data collection framework that collects robot demonstrations based on natural language supervision and further augments these demonstrations. We then present CLIP-RT, a vision-language-action (VLA) model that learns language-conditioned visuomotor policies from this supervision. CLIP-RT adapts the pretrained CLIP models and learns to predict language-based motion primitives via contrastive imitation learning. We train CLIP-RT on the Open X-Embodiment dataset and finetune it on in-domain data collected by our framework to learn diverse skills. CLIP-RT demonstrates strong capabilities in learning novel manipulation skills, outperforming the state-of-the-art model, OpenVLA (7B parameters), by 24% in average success rates, while using 7x fewer parameters (1B). We further observe that CLIP-RT shows significant improvements in few-shot generalization. Finally, through collaboration with humans or large pretrained models, we demonstrate that CLIP-RT can further improve its generalization on challenging tasks.</p></details> | 27 pages |
| **[Low-Complexity Cooperative Payload Transportation for Nonholonomic Mobile Robots Under Scalable Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13366v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative transportation, a key aspect of logistics cyber-physical systems (CPS), is typically approached using dis tributed control and optimization-based methods. The distributed control methods consume less time, but poorly handle and extend to multiple constraints. Instead, optimization-based methods handle constraints effectively, but they are usually centralized, time-consuming and thus not easily scalable to numerous robots. To overcome drawbacks of both, we propose a novel cooperative transportation method for nonholonomic mobile robots by im proving conventional formation control, which is distributed, has a low time-complexity and accommodates scalable constraints. The proposed control-based method is testified on a cable suspended payload and divided into two parts, including robot trajectory generation and trajectory tracking. Unlike most time consuming trajectory generation methods, ours can generate trajectories with only constant time-complexity, needless of global maps. As for trajectory tracking, our control-based method not only scales easily to multiple constraints as those optimization based methods, but reduces their time-complexity from poly nomial to linear. Simulations and experiments can verify the feasibility of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Space-Efficient Algebraic Approach to Robotic Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08219v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider efficient route planning for robots in applications such as infrastructure inspection and automated surgical imaging. These tasks can be modeled via the combinatorial problem Graph Inspection. The best known algorithms for this problem are limited in practice by exponential space complexity. In this paper, we develop a memory-efficient approach using algebraic tools related to monomial testing on the polynomials associated with certain arithmetic circuits. Our contributions are two-fold. We first repair a minor flaw in existing work on monomial detection using a new approach we call tree certificates. We further show that, in addition to detection, these tools allow us to efficiently recover monomials of interest from circuits, opening the door for significantly broadened application of related algebraic tools. For Graph Inspection, we design and evaluate a complete algebraic pipeline. Our engineered implementation demonstrates that circuit-based algorithms are indeed memory-efficient in practice, thus encouraging further engineering efforts.</p></details> |  |

Our approach enables in-situ data recording, visualization, and fine-tuning of skill demonstrations directly within the user's physical environment. RAMPA addresses critical challenges of PbD, such as safety concerns, programming barriers, and the inefficiency of collecting demonstrations on the actual hardware. The performance of our system is evaluated against the traditional method of kinesthetic control in teaching three different robotic manipulation tasks and analyzed with quantitative metrics, measuring task performance and completion time, trajectory smoothness, system usability, user experience, and task load using standardized surveys. Our findings indicate a substantial advancement in how robotic tasks are taught and refined, promising improvements in operational safety, efficiency, and user engagement in robotic programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is the final version submitted to the IEEE RA-L</p></details> |
| **[Pre-training Auto-regressive Robotic Models with 4D Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13142v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pre-trained on massive unlabeled datasets have revolutionized natural language and computer vision, exhibiting remarkable generalization capabilities, thus highlighting the importance of pre-training. Yet, efforts in robotics have struggled to achieve similar success, limited by either the need for costly robotic annotations or the lack of representations that effectively model the physical world. In this paper, we introduce ARM4R, an Auto-regressive Robotic Model that leverages low-level 4D Representations learned from human video data to yield a better pre-trained robotic model. Specifically, we focus on utilizing 3D point tracking representations from videos derived by lifting 2D representations into 3D space via monocular depth estimation across time. These 4D representations maintain a shared geometric structure between the points and robot state representations up to a linear transformation, enabling efficient transfer learning from human video data to low-level robotic control. Our experiments show that ARM4R can transfer efficiently from human video data to robotics and consistently improves performance on tasks across various robot environments and configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Data Curation with Mutual Information Estimators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08623v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of imitation learning policies often hinges on the datasets with which they are trained. Consequently, investment in data collection for robotics has grown across both industrial and academic labs. However, despite the marked increase in the quantity of demonstrations collected, little work has sought to assess the quality of said data despite mounting evidence of its importance in other areas such as vision and language. In this work, we take a critical step towards addressing the data quality in robotics. Given a dataset of demonstrations, we aim to estimate the relative quality of individual demonstrations in terms of both state diversity and action predictability. To do so, we estimate the average contribution of a trajectory towards the mutual information between states and actions in the entire dataset, which precisely captures both the entropy of the state distribution and the state-conditioned entropy of actions. Though commonly used mutual information estimators require vast amounts of data often beyond the scale available in robotics, we introduce a novel technique based on k-nearest neighbor estimates of mutual information on top of simple VAE embeddings of states and actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach is able to partition demonstration datasets by quality according to human expert scores across a diverse set of benchmarks spanning simulation and real world environments. Moreover, training policies based on data filtered by our method leads to a 5-10% improvement in RoboMimic and better performance on real ALOHA and Franka setups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Videos and code at https://jhejna.github.io/demonstration-info.

| **[A Real-to-Sim-to-Real Approach to Robotic Manipulation with VLM-Generated Iterative Keypoint Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08643v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task specification for robotic manipulation in open-world environments is challenging, requiring flexible and adaptive objectives that align with human intentions and can evolve through iterative feedback. We introduce Iterative Keypoint Reward (IKER), a visually grounded, Python-based reward function that serves as a dynamic task specification. Our framework leverages VLMs to generate and refine these reward functions for multi-step manipulation tasks. Given RGB-D observations and free-form language instructions, we sample keypoints in the scene and generate a reward function conditioned on these keypoints. IKER operates on the spatial relationships between keypoints, leveraging commonsense priors about the desired behaviors, and enabling precise SE(3) control. We reconstruct real-world scenes in simulation and use the generated rewards to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are then deployed into the real world-forming a real-to-sim-to-real loop. Our approach demonstrates notable capabilities across diverse scenarios, including both prehensile and non-prehensile tasks, showcasing multi-step task execution, spontaneous error recovery, and on-the-fly strategy adjustments. The results highlight IKER's effectiveness in enabling robots to perform multi-step tasks in dynamic environments through iterative reward shaping.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2025, Project Page: https://iker-robot.github.io/</p></details> |
