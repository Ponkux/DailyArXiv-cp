| **[Agentic 3D Scene Generation with Spatially Contextualized VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20129v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

| **[EmbodiedGen: Towards a Generative 3D World Engine for Embodied Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10600v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing a physically realistic and accurately scaled simulated 3D world is crucial for the training and evaluation of embodied intelligence tasks. The diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI. However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation. EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging generative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the needs of embodied intelligence related research.

| **[Object-Centric Latent Action Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09680v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled internet video data for embodied AI is currently bottlenecked by the lack of action labels and the presence of action-correlated visual distractors. Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy-action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle action-related and distracting dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Workshop on World Models at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Latent Action Learning Requires Supervision in the Presence of Distractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00379v5)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025, Poster, Project Page: https://laom.dunnolab.ai/, Source code: https://github.com/dunnolab/laom</p></details> |
| **[A Navigation Framework Utilizing Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10172v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[OctoNav: Towards Generalist Embodied Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09839v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents, which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1. Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1, we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e., Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically, we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability. Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Analytic Task Scheduler: Recursive Least Squares Based Method for Continual Learning in Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09623v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied foundation models are crucial for Artificial Intelligence (AI) interacting with the physical world by integrating multi-modal inputs, such as proprioception, vision and language, to understand human intentions and generate actions to control robots. While these models demonstrate strong generalization and few-shot learning capabilities, they face significant challenges in continually acquiring new skills without forgetting previously learned skills, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for continual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a task-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a single task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares (RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific models. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model selection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The scheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics (autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant learning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a real-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to forgetting and strong adaptability to task variations. The results highlight ATS as an effective, scalable, and deployable solution for continual learning in embodied foundation models operating in complex, dynamic environments. Our code will be available at https://github.com/MIAA-Embodied-AI/AnalyticTaskScheduler</p></details> |  |
| **[What Can RL Bring to VLA Generalization? An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

| **[VIKI-R: Coordinating Embodied Multi-Agent Cooperation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09049v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://faceong.github.io/VIKI-R/</p></details> |
| **[Generalizable Articulated Object Reconstruction from Casually Captured RGBD Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08334v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Understanding their kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$ larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos, outperforming existing methods significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website can be found at https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/video2articulation/</p></details> |
| **[Dreamland: Controllable World Creation with Simulator and Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08006v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI agents. We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://metadriverse.github.io/dreamland/</p></details> |
| **[DINeMo: Learning Neural Mesh Models with no 3D Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20220v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-level 3D/6D pose estimation is a crucial step towards comprehensive 3D scene understanding, which would enable a broad range of applications in robotics and embodied AI. Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations. Our project page is available at https://analysis-by-synthesis.github.io/DINeMo/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 3rd Workshop on Compositional 3D Vision at CVPR 2025 (C3DV)</p></details> |
| **[LLM-driven Indoor Scene Layout Generation via Scaled Human-aligned Data Synthesis and Multi-Stage Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07570v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Step Guided Diffusion for Image Restoration on Edge Devices: Toward Lightweight Perception in Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07286v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable flexibility for solving inverse problems without task-specific retraining. However, existing approaches such as Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes. Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such as drones and mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025 Embodied AI Workshop</p></details> |
| **[DaDu-Corki: Algorithm-Architecture Co-Design for Embodied AI-powered Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04292v5)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI robots have the potential to fundamentally improve the way human beings live and manufacture. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate, and this trend is strongly evident in manipulation tasks. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots for manipulation tasks are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes \textsc{Corki}\xspace, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI-powered robotic manipulation applications. We aim to decouple LLM inference, robotic control, and data communication in the embodied AI robots' compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, \textsc{Corki}\xspace predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. \textsc{Corki}\xspace largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to $5.1\times$, resulting in up to $5.9\times$ speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 13.9\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucinate, Ground, Repeat: A Framework for Generalized Visual Relationship Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05651v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence (maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21 held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed. Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors for scalable open-world visual understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05341v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://directlayout.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[OGGSplat: Open Gaussian Growing for Generalizable Reconstruction with Expanded Field-of-View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05204v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards provable probabilistic safety for scalable embodied AI systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05171v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. To address this challenge, we introduce provable probabilistic safety, which aims to ensure that the residual risk of large-scale deployment remains below a predefined threshold. Instead of attempting exhaustive safety proof across all corner cases, this paradigm establishes a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance, leveraging statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability. A well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale while allowing for continuous refinement of safety guarantees. Our work focuses on three core questions: what is provable probabilistic safety, how to prove the probabilistic safety, and how to achieve the provable probabilistic safety. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, our work offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  |

Both components employ modular 3D-printed finger designs, achieving ultra-low manufacturing costs while maintaining full actuation capabilities. Departing from conventional tendon-driven or underactuated approaches, our electromechanical system integrates independent joint motors across all 23 DoF, ensuring complete state observability and accurate kinematic modeling. This full-actuation architecture enables precise bidirectional kinematic calculations, substantially enhancing kinematic retargeting fidelity between the exoskeleton and robotic hand. The proposed system bridges the cost-performance gap in dexterous manipulation research, providing an accessible platform for acquiring high-quality demonstration data to advance embodied AI and dexterous robotic skill transfer learning.</p></details> |  |

| **[Training Cross-Morphology Embodied AI Agents: From Practical Challenges to Theoretical Foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03613v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While theory and practice are often seen as separate domains, this article shows that theoretical insight is essential for overcoming real-world engineering barriers. We begin with a practical challenge: training a cross-morphology embodied AI policy that generalizes across diverse robot morphologies. We formalize this as the Heterogeneous Embodied Agent Training (HEAT) problem and prove it reduces to a structured Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that is PSPACE-complete. This result explains why current reinforcement learning pipelines break down under morphological diversity, due to sequential training constraints, memory-policy coupling, and data incompatibility. We further explore Collective Adaptation, a distributed learning alternative inspired by biological systems. Though NEXP-complete in theory, it offers meaningful scalability and deployment benefits in practice.

Traditional learning-based methods rely heavily on large-scale annotated data or require extensive interaction with the environment in a reinforcement learning setting, often failing to generalize to novel environments and limiting scalability. To overcome these challenges, we explore a zero-shot setting where the agent operates without task-specific training, enabling more scalable and adaptable solution. Recent advances in Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) offer powerful capabilities for visual understanding and reasoning, making them ideal for agents to comprehend scenes, identify relevant regions, and infer the likely locations of objects. In this work, we present a zero-shot object goal navigation framework that integrates the perceptual strength of VFMs with a model-based planner that is capable of long-horizon decision making through frontier exploration. We evaluate our approach on the HM3D dataset using the Habitat simulator and demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of success weighted by path length for zero-shot object goal navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 workshop - Foundation Models Meet Embodied Agents</p></details> |

Specifically, Map and Locate involves generating a point cloud from an unposed video and segmenting object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task serves as a critical step toward real-world embodied AI applications and introduces a practical task that bridges reconstruction, recognition and reorganization. To tackle this task, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline, which we denote as SAB3R. Our approach builds upon MASt3R, a recent breakthrough in 3D computer vision, and incorporates a lightweight distillation strategy. This method transfers dense, per-pixel semantic features from 2D vision backbones (eg, CLIP and DINOv2) to enhance MASt3R's capabilities. Without introducing any auxiliary frozen networks, our model generates per-pixel semantic features and constructs cohesive point maps in a single forward pass. Compared to separately deploying MASt3R and CLIP, our unified model, SAB3R, achieves superior performance on the Map and Locate benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate SAB3R on both 2D semantic segmentation and 3D tasks to comprehensively validate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>3D-LL...</summary><p>3D-LLM/VLA @ CVPR2025 | Project page: https://uva-computer-vision-lab.github.io/sab3r/</p></details> |

We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric video contexts. EgoVLM is fine-tuned via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method adapted to align model outputs with human-like reasoning steps. Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought (CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by 14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability, making it well-suited for downstream applications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel keyframe-based reward that incorporates salient frame selection to guide reinforcement learning optimization. This reward formulation opens a promising avenue for future exploration in temporally grounded egocentric reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our C...</summary><p>Our Code can be found at https://github.com/adityavavre/VidEgoVLM</p></details> |

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Online Tuning of VLM Agents via Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03792v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online fine-tuning vision-language model (VLM) agents with reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for equipping agents with multi-step, goal-oriented capabilities in dynamic environments. However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains.

Recent learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure. To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time. Rig raymaps allow the model to infer rig structure directly from input images when metadata is missing. Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-the-wild Audio Spatialization with Flexible Text-guided Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00927v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enhance immersive experiences, binaural audio offers spatial awareness of sounding objects in AR, VR, and embodied AI applications. While existing audio spatialization methods can generally map any available monaural audio to binaural audio signals, they often lack the flexible and interactive control needed in complex multi-object user-interactive environments. To address this, we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes flexible text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and comprehension perspectives. Due to the limited availability of premium and large-scale stereo data, we construct the SpatialTAS dataset, which encompasses 376,000 simulated binaural audio samples to facilitate the training of our model. Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and relative position prompts, augmented by flipped-channel audio. It outperforms existing methods on both simulated and real-recorded datasets, demonstrating superior generalization and accuracy. Besides, we develop an assessment model based on Llama-3.1-8B, which evaluates the spatial semantic coherence between our generated binaural audio and text prompts through a spatial reasoning task. Results demonstrate that text prompts provide flexible and interactive control to generate binaural audio with excellent quality and semantic consistency in spatial locations.

Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, i.e., pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the representation strategy. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multifaceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multimodal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by TMLR</p></details> |

We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy. For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

While more robotics datasets are being created, the landscape of open data in the field is uneven. This is due to a lack of curation standards and consistent publication practices, which makes it difficult to discover, access, and reuse robotics data. To address these challenges, this paper presents a curation and access system with two main contributions: (1) a structured methodology to curate, publish, and integrate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) human-centered robotics datasets; and (2) a ChatGPT-powered conversational interface trained with the curated datasets metadata and documentation to enable exploration, comparison robotics datasets and data retrieval using natural language. Developed based on practical experience curating datasets from robotics labs within Texas Robotics at the University of Texas at Austin, the system demonstrates the value of standardized curation and persistent publication of robotics data. The system's evaluation suggests that access and understandability of human-robotics data are significantly improved. This work directly aligns with the goals of the HCRL @ ICRA 2025 workshop and represents a step towards more human-centered access to data for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages (excluding references), 8 pages (including references); 5 figures; accepted to the ICRA 2025 Workshop on Human-Centered Robot Learning in the Era of Big Data and Large Models</p></details> |

Egocentric Spatial Reasoning in VLMs Across Disjoint Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24257v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An embodied AI assistant operating on egocentric video must integrate spatial cues across time - for instance, determining where an object A, glimpsed a few moments ago lies relative to an object B encountered later. We introduce Disjoint-3DQA , a generative QA benchmark that evaluates this ability of VLMs by posing questions about object pairs that are not co-visible in the same frame. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art VLMs and found that models lag behind human performance by 28%, with steeper declines in accuracy (60% to 30 %) as the temporal gap widens. Our analysis further reveals that providing trajectories or bird's-eye-view projections to VLMs results in only marginal improvements, whereas providing oracle 3D coordinates leads to a substantial 20% performance increase. This highlights a core bottleneck of multi-frame VLMs in constructing and maintaining 3D scene representations over time from visual signals. Disjoint-3DQA therefore sets a clear, measurable challenge for long-horizon spatial reasoning and aims to catalyze future research at the intersection of vision, language, and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing simulation frameworks typically support a narrow range of scenes/tasks and lack features critical for scaling generalizable robotics and sim2real. We introduce and open source ManiSkill3, the fastest state-visual GPU parallelized robotics simulator with contact-rich physics targeting generalizable manipulation. ManiSkill3 supports GPU parallelization of many aspects including simulation+rendering, heterogeneous simulation, pointclouds/voxels visual input, and more. Simulation with rendering on ManiSkill3 can run 10-1000x faster with 2-3x less GPU memory usage than other platforms, achieving up to 30,000+ FPS in benchmarked environments due to minimal python/pytorch overhead in the system, simulation on the GPU, and the use of the SAPIEN parallel rendering system. Tasks that used to take hours to train can now take minutes. We further provide the most comprehensive range of GPU parallelized environments/tasks spanning 12 distinct domains including but not limited to mobile manipulation for tasks such as drawing, humanoids, and dextrous manipulation in realistic scenes designed by artists or real-world digital twins. In addition, millions of demonstration frames are provided from motion planning, RL, and teleoperation.

Modeling hand-object interaction priors holds significant potential to advance robotic and embodied AI systems in learning to operate effectively within the physical world. We introduce SIGHT, a novel task focused on generating realistic and physically plausible 3D hand-object interaction trajectories from a single image and a brief language-based task description. Prior work on hand-object trajectory generation typically relies on textual input that lacks explicit grounding to the target object, or assumes access to 3D object meshes, which are often considerably more difficult to obtain than 2D images. We propose SIGHT-Fusion, a novel diffusion-based image-text conditioned generative model that tackles this task by retrieving the most similar 3D object mesh from a database and enforcing geometric hand-object interaction constraints via a novel inference-time diffusion guidance. We benchmark our model on the HOI4D and H2O datasets, adapting relevant baselines for this novel task. Experiments demonstrate our superior performance in the diversity and quality of generated trajectories, as well as in hand-object interaction geometry metrics.</p></details> |  |

This task is inherently challenging as it requires both accurate target recognition and effective trajectory planning under conditions of severe occlusion and high scene dynamics. Existing approaches typically address this challenge through a modular separation of recognition and planning. In this work, we propose TrackVLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that learns the synergy between object recognition and trajectory planning. Leveraging a shared LLM backbone, we employ a language modeling head for recognition and an anchor-based diffusion model for trajectory planning. To train TrackVLA, we construct an Embodied Visual Tracking Benchmark (EVT-Bench) and collect diverse difficulty levels of recognition samples, resulting in a dataset of 1.7 million samples. Through extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world environments, TrackVLA demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalizability. It significantly outperforms existing methods on public benchmarks in a zero-shot manner while remaining robust to high dynamics and occlusion in real-world scenarios at 10 FPS inference speed.

A Benchmark and Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19510v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for their expanding applications in embodied AI, robotics, and other real-world tasks. To effectively support these applications, grounding in spatial and temporal understanding in multimodal environments is essential. To this end, recent works have leveraged scene graphs, a structured representation that encodes entities, attributes, and their relationships in a scene. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs' ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that these models fail to effectively decompose discrete scenes from a complex narrative, leading to a bottleneck when generating scene graphs. These findings underscore the need for improved methodologies in scene graph generation and provide valuable insights for future research. The demonstration of our benchmark is available at https://tsg-bench.netlify.app. Additionally, our code and evaluation data are publicly available at https://github.com/docworlds/tsg-bench.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |

By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interactions, robots can improve understanding, adapt to, and execute complex tasks in dynamic real-world environments. However, embodied AI in mobile service robots continues to face key challenges, including multimodal sensor fusion, real-time decision-making under uncertainty, task generalization, and effective human-robot interactions (HRI). In this paper, we present the first systematic review of the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics, identifying key open challenges in embodied AI and examining how foundation models can address them.

Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications in the domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation sectors, demonstrating the transformative impact of foundation models on service robotics. We also include potential future research directions, emphasizing the need for predictive scaling laws, autonomous long-term adaptation, and cross-embodiment generalization to enable scalable, efficient, and robust deployment of foundation models in human-centric robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Identity-Preserving Multi-Person Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18078v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable video generation (CVG) has advanced rapidly, yet current systems falter when more than one actor must move, interact, and exchange positions under noisy control signals. We address this gap with DanceTogether, the first end-to-end diffusion framework that turns a single reference image plus independent pose-mask streams into long, photorealistic videos while strictly preserving every identity. A novel MaskPoseAdapter binds "who" and "how" at every denoising step by fusing robust tracking masks with semantically rich-but noisy-pose heat-maps, eliminating the identity drift and appearance bleeding that plague frame-wise pipelines. To train and evaluate at scale, we introduce (i) PairFS-4K, 26 hours of dual-skater footage with 7,000+ distinct IDs, (ii) HumanRob-300, a one-hour humanoid-robot interaction set for rapid cross-domain transfer, and (iii) TogetherVideoBench, a three-track benchmark centered on the DanceTogEval-100 test suite covering dance, boxing, wrestling, yoga, and figure skating. On TogetherVideoBench, DanceTogether outperforms the prior arts by a significant margin. Moreover, we show that a one-hour fine-tune yields convincing human-robot videos, underscoring broad generalization to embodied-AI and HRI tasks. Extensive ablations confirm that persistent identity-action binding is critical to these gains. Together, our model, datasets, and benchmark lift CVG from single-subject choreography to compositionally controllable, multi-actor interaction, opening new avenues for digital production, simulation, and embodied intelligence.

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust, long-term reasoning and planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perceptual Quality Assessment for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16815v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI has developed rapidly in recent years, but it is still mainly deployed in laboratories, with various distortions in the Real-world limiting its application. Traditionally, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are applied to predict human preferences for distorted images; however, there is no IQA method to assess the usability of an image in embodied tasks, namely, the perceptual quality for robots. To provide accurate and reliable quality indicators for future embodied scenarios, we first propose the topic: IQA for Embodied AI. Specifically, we (1) based on the Mertonian system and meta-cognitive theory, constructed a perception-cognition-decision-execution pipeline and defined a comprehensive subjective score collection process; (2) established the Embodied-IQA database, containing over 36k reference/distorted image pairs, with more than 5m fine-grained annotations provided by Vision Language Models/Vision Language Action-models/Real-world robots; (3) trained and validated the performance of mainstream IQA methods on Embodied-IQA, demonstrating the need to develop more accurate quality indicators for Embodied AI. We sincerely hope that through evaluation, we can promote the application of Embodied AI under complex distortions in the Real-world.

This paper shows that VLMs can achieve surprisingly strong decision-making performance when visual scenes are represented merely as text-only descriptions, suggesting foundational reasoning can be effectively learned from language. Motivated by this insight, we propose Praxis-VLM, a reasoning VLM for vision-grounded decision-making. Praxis-VLM employs the GRPO algorithm on textual scenarios to instill robust reasoning capabilities, where models learn to evaluate actions and their consequences. These reasoning skills, acquired purely from text, successfully transfer to multimodal inference with visual inputs, significantly reducing reliance on scarce paired image-text training data. Experiments across diverse decision-making benchmarks demonstrate that Praxis-VLM substantially outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning, exhibiting superior performance and generalizability. Further analysis confirms that our models engage in explicit and effective reasoning, underpinning their enhanced performance and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

Recent success of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates that specialization of parameters enables strong scalability. In this work, we propose DriveMoE, a novel MoE-based E2E-AD framework, with a Scene-Specialized Vision MoE and a Skill-Specialized Action MoE. DriveMoE is built upon our $\pi_0$ Vision-Language-Action (VLA) baseline (originally from the embodied AI field), called Drive-$\pi_0$. Specifically, we add Vision MoE to Drive-$\pi_0$ by training a router to select relevant cameras according to the driving context dynamically. This design mirrors human driving cognition, where drivers selectively attend to crucial visual cues rather than exhaustively processing all visual information. In addition, we add Action MoE by training another router to activate specialized expert modules for different driving behaviors. Through explicit behavioral specialization, DriveMoE is able to handle diverse scenarios without suffering from modes averaging like existing models. In Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation experiments, DriveMoE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining vision and action MoE in autonomous driving tasks. We will release our code and models of DriveMoE and Drive-$\pi_0$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://thinklab-sjtu.github.io/DriveMoE/</p></details> |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intentional Gesture: Deliver Your Intentions with Gestures for Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15197v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When humans speak, gestures help convey communicative intentions, such as adding emphasis or describing concepts. However, current co-speech gesture generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (\textit{e.g.} speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Intentional-Gesture}, a novel framework that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in high-level communicative functions. % First, we curate the \textbf{InG} dataset by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (\textit{i.e.}, text sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the \textbf{Intentional Gesture Motion Tokenizer} to leverage these intention annotations. It injects high-level communicative functions (\textit{e.g.}, intentions) into tokenized motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture</p></details> |  |

With recent advances in robotics and foundational AI models, we stand at the threshold of a new era-one marked by increasingly generalized embodied AI systems. This paper contributes to the discourse by introducing a systematic taxonomy of Embodied AGI spanning five levels (L1-L5). We review existing research and challenges at the foundational stages (L1-L2) and outline the key components required to achieve higher-level capabilities (L3-L5). Building on these insights and existing technologies, we propose a conceptual framework for an L3+ robotic brain, offering both a technical outlook and a foundation for future exploration.</p></details> |  |

However, the capability of existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend and reason about such panoramic scenes remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing OmniVQA, the first dataset and conducting the first benchmark for omnidirectional visual question answering. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant limitations in handling omnidirectional visual question answering, highlighting persistent challenges in object localization, feature extraction, and hallucination suppression within panoramic contexts. These results underscore the disconnect between current MLLM capabilities and the demands of omnidirectional visual understanding, which calls for dedicated architectural or training innovations tailored to 360{\deg} imagery. Building on the OmniVQA dataset and benchmark, we further introduce a rule-based reinforcement learning method, 360-R1, based on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct. Concretely, we modify the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by proposing three novel reward functions: (1) reasoning process similarity reward, (2) answer semantic accuracy reward, and (3) structured format compliance reward. Extensive experiments on our OmniVQA demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in omnidirectional space (+6% improvement).</p></details> |  |

The emerging new factor in this trend is morphological evolution, the evolution of physical forms within embodied AI systems such as robots. In this study, we investigate a system of hexacopter-type drones with evolvable morphologies and learnable controllers and make contributions to two fields. For aerial robotics, we demonstrate that the combination of evolution and learning can deliver non-conventional drones that significantly outperform the traditional hexacopter on several tasks that are more complex than previously considered in the literature. For the field of Evolutionary Computing, we introduce novel metrics and perform new analyses into the interaction of morphological evolution and learning, uncovering hitherto unidentified effects. Our analysis tools are domain-agnostic, making a methodological contribution towards building solid foundations for embodied AI systems that integrate evolution and learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 figures, currently under review</p></details> |

Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets.

Yet progress has been limited by the absence of large-scale, real-time, multi-modal, and socially interactive datasets that reflect the sensory-motor complexity of natural environments. To address this, we present PLAICraft, a novel data collection platform and dataset capturing multiplayer Minecraft interactions across five time-aligned modalities: video, game output audio, microphone input audio, mouse, and keyboard actions. Each modality is logged with millisecond time precision, enabling the study of synchronous, embodied behaviour in a rich, open-ended world. The dataset comprises over 10,000 hours of gameplay from more than 10,000 global participants.\footnote{We have done a privacy review for the public release of an initial 200-hour subset of the dataset, with plans to release most of the dataset over time.} Alongside the dataset, we provide an evaluation suite for benchmarking model capabilities in object recognition, spatial awareness, language grounding, and long-term memory. PLAICraft opens a path toward training and evaluating agents that act fluently and purposefully in real time, paving the way for truly embodied artificial intelligence.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

Building on these developments, text-to-video diffusion models have evolved into embodied world models (EWMs) capable of generating physically plausible scenes from language commands, effectively bridging vision and action in embodied AI applications. This work addresses the critical challenge of evaluating EWMs beyond general perceptual metrics to ensure the generation of physically grounded and action-consistent behaviors. We propose the Embodied World Model Benchmark (EWMBench), a dedicated framework designed to evaluate EWMs based on three key aspects: visual scene consistency, motion correctness, and semantic alignment. Our approach leverages a meticulously curated dataset encompassing diverse scenes and motion patterns, alongside a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation toolkit, to assess and compare candidate models. The proposed benchmark not only identifies the limitations of existing video generation models in meeting the unique requirements of embodied tasks but also provides valuable insights to guide future advancements in the field.

Behaviors like searching for objects, reaching, and hand-eye coordination naturally emerge from the structure of our sensory system. Inspired by these principles, we introduce Perceptive Dexterous Control (PDC), a framework for vision-driven dexterous whole-body control with simulated humanoids. PDC operates solely on egocentric vision for task specification, enabling object search, target placement, and skill selection through visual cues, without relying on privileged state information (e.g., 3D object positions and geometries). This perception-as-interface paradigm enables learning a single policy to perform multiple household tasks, including reaching, grasping, placing, and articulated object manipulation. We also show that training from scratch with reinforcement learning can produce emergent behaviors such as active search. These results demonstrate how vision-driven control and complex tasks induce human-like behaviors and can serve as the key ingredients in closing the perception-action loop for animation, robotics, and embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zhengyiluo.github.io/PDC</p></details> |

Although recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in visual-spatial reasoning, most studies focus on standard pinhole-view images, leaving omnidirectional perception largely unexplored. In this paper, we ask: Are MLLMs ready for omnidirectional spatial reasoning? To investigate this, we introduce OSR-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed for this setting. OSR-Bench includes over 153,000 diverse question-answer pairs grounded in high-fidelity panoramic indoor scene maps. It covers key reasoning types including object counting, relative distance, and direction. We also propose a negative sampling strategy that inserts non-existent objects into prompts to evaluate hallucination and grounding robustness. For fine-grained analysis, we design a two-stage evaluation framework assessing both cognitive map generation and QA accuracy using rotation-invariant matching and a combination of rule-based and LLM-based metrics. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and leading open-source models under zero-shot settings. Results show that current models struggle with spatial reasoning in panoramic contexts, highlighting the need for more perceptually grounded MLLMs. OSR-Bench and code will be released at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/UUUserna/OSR-Bench</p></details> |  |

These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: Foundation Models (FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas Federated Learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied environments. In this vision paper, we introduce Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed nature of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical deployment dimensions of FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning, Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision actionable research directions.

However, the proliferation of vendor-specific proprietary communication libraries creates significant interoperability barriers, hindering seamless collaboration between different accelerator types and leading to suboptimal resource utilization and performance bottlenecks in distributed AI workloads. This paper introduces KAITIAN, a novel distributed communication framework designed to bridge this gap. KAITIAN provides a unified abstraction layer that intelligently integrates vendor-optimized communication libraries for intra-group efficiency with general-purpose communication protocols for inter-group interoperability. Crucially, it incorporates a load-adaptive scheduling mechanism that dynamically balances computational tasks across heterogeneous devices based on their real-time performance characteristics. Implemented as an extension to PyTorch and rigorously evaluated on a testbed featuring NVIDIA GPUs and Cambricon MLUs, KAITIAN demonstrates significant improvements in resource utilization and scalability for distributed training tasks. Experimental results show that KAITIAN can accelerate training time by up to 42% compared to baseline homogeneous systems, while incurring minimal communication overhead (2.8--4.3%) and maintaining model accuracy. KAITIAN paves the way for more flexible and powerful heterogeneous computing in complex embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

Current approaches suffer from significant domain gaps between training datasets and robot manipulation tasks, while also lacking model architectures that can effectively incorporate 3D information. To overcome these limitations, we enhance the DROID dataset with high-quality depth maps and point clouds, constructing DROID-3D as a valuable supplement for 3D embodied vision research. Then we develop EmbodiedMAE, a multi-modal masked autoencoder that simultaneously learns representations across RGB, depth, and point cloud modalities through stochastic masking and cross-modal fusion. Trained on DROID-3D, EmbodiedMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art vision foundation models (VFMs) in both training efficiency and final performance across 70 simulation tasks and 20 real-world robot manipulation tasks on two robot platforms. The model exhibits strong scaling behavior with size and promotes effective policy learning from 3D inputs. Experimental results establish EmbodiedMAE as a reliable unified 3D multi-modal VFM for embodied AI systems, particularly in precise tabletop manipulation settings where spatial perception is critical.</p></details> |  |

However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 17 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

This revolutionary force offers the most promising path yet toward solving one of engineering's grandest challenges: achieving reliable, fully autonomous driving, particularly the pursuit of Level 5 autonomy. This survey delivers a comprehensive and critical synthesis of the emerging role of GenAI across the autonomous driving stack. We begin by distilling the principles and trade-offs of modern generative modeling, encompassing VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models (LLMs). We then map their frontier applications in image, LiDAR, trajectory, occupancy, video generation as well as LLM-guided reasoning and decision making. We categorize practical applications, such as synthetic data workflows, end-to-end driving strategies, high-fidelity digital twin systems, smart transportation networks, and cross-domain transfer to embodied AI. We identify key obstacles and possibilities such as comprehensive generalization across rare cases, evaluation and safety checks, budget-limited implementation, regulatory compliance, ethical concerns, and environmental effects, while proposing research plans across theoretical assurances, trust metrics, transport integration, and socio-technical influence. By unifying these threads, the survey provides a forward-looking reference for researchers, engineers, and policymakers navigating the convergence of generative AI and advanced autonomous mobility.

However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |

Collaboration between LLMs and SLMs emerges as a crucial paradigm to synergistically balance these trade-offs, enabling advanced AI applications, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-SLM collaboration, detailing various interaction mechanisms (pipeline, routing, auxiliary, distillation, fusion), key enabling technologies, and diverse application scenarios driven by on-device needs like low latency, privacy, personalization, and offline operation. While highlighting the significant potential for creating more efficient, adaptable, and accessible AI, we also discuss persistent challenges including system overhead, inter-model consistency, robust task allocation, evaluation complexity, and security/privacy concerns. Future directions point towards more intelligent adaptive frameworks, deeper model fusion, and expansion into multimodal and embodied AI, positioning LLM-SLM collaboration as a key driver for the next generation of practical and ubiquitous artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoptic, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 35 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |
| **[GeoNav: Empowering MLLMs with Explicit Geospatial Reasoning Abilities for Language-Goal Aerial Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09587v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-goal aerial navigation is a critical challenge in embodied AI, requiring UAVs to localize targets in complex environments such as urban blocks based on textual specification. Existing methods, often adapted from indoor navigation, struggle to scale due to limited field of view, semantic ambiguity among objects, and lack of structured spatial reasoning. In this work, we propose GeoNav, a geospatially aware multimodal agent to enable long-range navigation. GeoNav operates in three phases-landmark navigation, target search, and precise localization-mimicking human coarse-to-fine spatial strategies. To support such reasoning, it dynamically builds two different types of spatial memory. The first is a global but schematic cognitive map, which fuses prior textual geographic knowledge and embodied visual cues into a top-down, annotated form for fast navigation to the landmark region. The second is a local but delicate scene graph representing hierarchical spatial relationships between blocks, landmarks, and objects, which is used for definite target localization. On top of this structured representation, GeoNav employs a spatially aware, multimodal chain-of-thought prompting mechanism to enable multimodal large language models with efficient and interpretable decision-making across stages. On the CityNav urban navigation benchmark, GeoNav surpasses the current state-of-the-art by up to 12.53% in success rate and significantly improves navigation efficiency, even in hard-level tasks. Ablation studies highlight the importance of each module, showcasing how geospatial representations and coarse-to-fine reasoning enhance UAV navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Agentic AI Networking in 6G: A Generative Foundation Model-as-Agent Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15764v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The promising potential of AI and network convergence in improving networking performance and enabling new service capabilities has recently attracted significant interest. Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |

In actual environments, agents continuously encounter unpredicted situations and distribution shifts, causing seemingly reliable policies to experience catastrophic failures, particularly in manipulation tasks. To address this gap, we introduce four novel safety-centric metrics that quantify an agent's resilience to environmental perturbations. Building on these metrics, we present Adaptive Contrastive Optimization for Robust Manipulation (ACORN), a plug-and-play algorithm that enhances policy robustness without sacrificing performance. ACORN leverages contrastive learning to simultaneously align trajectories with expert demonstrations while diverging from potentially unsafe behaviors. Our approach efficiently generates informative negative samples through structured Gaussian noise injection, employing a double perturbation technique that maintains sample diversity while minimizing computational overhead. Comprehensive experiments across diverse manipulation environments validate ACORN's effectiveness, yielding improvements of up to 23% in safety metrics under disturbance compared to baseline methods. These findings underscore ACORN's significant potential for enabling reliable deployment of embodied agents in safety-critical real-world applications.</p></details> | 6 pages,4 figures |
| **[GRACE: Estimating Geometry-level 3D Human-Scene Contact from 2D Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06575v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the geometry level of human-scene contact aims to ground specific contact surface points at 3D human geometries, which provides a spatial prior and bridges the interaction between human and scene, supporting applications such as human behavior analysis, embodied AI, and AR/VR. To complete the task, existing approaches predominantly rely on parametric human models (e.g., SMPL), which establish correspondences between images and contact regions through fixed SMPL vertex sequences. This actually completes the mapping from image features to an ordered sequence. However, this approach lacks consideration of geometry, limiting its generalizability in distinct human geometries. In this paper, we introduce GRACE (Geometry-level Reasoning for 3D Human-scene Contact Estimation), a new paradigm for 3D human contact estimation. GRACE incorporates a point cloud encoder-decoder architecture along with a hierarchical feature extraction and fusion module, enabling the effective integration of 3D human geometric structures with 2D interaction semantics derived from images. Guided by visual cues, GRACE establishes an implicit mapping from geometric features to the vertex space of the 3D human mesh, thereby achieving accurate modeling of contact regions. This design ensures high prediction accuracy and endows the framework with strong generalization capability across diverse human geometries. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that GRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance in contact estimation, with additional results further validating its robust generalization to unstructured human point clouds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-LSTM based Multi-Agent DRL with Computation-aware Pruning for Agent Twins Migration in Vehicular Embodied AI Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06378v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of large language models and embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the intelligent transportation scenarios, the combination of them in intelligent transportation spawns the Vehicular Embodied AI Network (VEANs). In VEANs, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are typical agents whose local advanced AI applications are defined as vehicular embodied AI agents, enabling capabilities such as environment perception and multi-agent collaboration. Due to computation latency and resource constraints, the local AI applications and services running on vehicular embodied AI agents need to be migrated, and subsequently referred to as vehicular embodied AI agent twins, which drive the advancement of vehicular embodied AI networks to offload intensive tasks to Roadside Units (RSUs), mitigating latency problems while maintaining service quality. Recognizing workload imbalance among RSUs in traditional approaches, we model AV-RSU interactions as a Stackelberg game to optimize bandwidth resource allocation for efficient migration. A Tiny Multi-Agent Bidirectional LSTM Proximal Policy Optimization (TMABLPPO) algorithm is designed to approximate the Stackelberg equilibrium through decentralized coordination. Furthermore, a personalized neural network pruning algorithm based on Path eXclusion (PX) dynamically adapts to heterogeneous AV computation capabilities by identifying task-critical parameters in trained models, reducing model complexity with less performance degradation. Experimental validation confirms the algorithm's effectiveness in balancing system load and minimizing delays, demonstrating significant improvements in vehicular embodied AI agent deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[CityNavAgent: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation with Hierarchical Semantic Planning and Global Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05622v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial vision-and-language navigation (VLN), requiring drones to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex urban environments, emerges as a critical embodied AI challenge that bridges human-robot interaction, 3D spatial reasoning, and real-world deployment. Although existing ground VLN agents achieved notable results in indoor and outdoor settings, they struggle in aerial VLN due to the absence of predefined navigation graphs and the exponentially expanding action space in long-horizon exploration. In this work, we propose \textbf{CityNavAgent}, a large language model (LLM)-empowered agent that significantly reduces the navigation complexity for urban aerial VLN. Specifically, we design a hierarchical semantic planning module (HSPM) that decomposes the long-horizon task into sub-goals with different semantic levels. The agent reaches the target progressively by achieving sub-goals with different capacities of the LLM. Additionally, a global memory module storing historical trajectories into a topological graph is developed to simplify navigation for visited targets. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvement. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of different modules of CityNavAgent for aerial VLN in continuous city environments.

Early methods based on procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations, trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets, evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations, and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity, physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D vision, and embodied intelligence.

| **[SITE: towards Spatial Intelligence Thorough Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05456v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence (SI) represents a cognitive ability encompassing the visualization, manipulation, and reasoning about spatial relationships, underpinning disciplines from neuroscience to robotics. We introduce SITE, a benchmark dataset towards SI Thorough Evaluation in a standardized format of multi-choice visual question-answering, designed to assess large vision-language models' spatial intelligence across diverse visual modalities (single-image, multi-image, and video) and SI factors (figural to environmental scales, spatial visualization and orientation, intrinsic and extrinsic, static and dynamic). Our approach to curating the benchmark combines a bottom-up survey about 31 existing datasets and a top-down strategy drawing upon three classification systems in cognitive science, which prompt us to design two novel types of tasks about view-taking and dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments reveal that leading models fall behind human experts especially in spatial orientation, a fundamental SI factor. Moreover, we demonstrate a positive correlation between a model's spatial reasoning proficiency and its performance on an embodied AI task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Embodied AI: Advances and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05108v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[RobotxR1: Enabling Embodied Robotic Intelligence on Large Language Models through Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03238v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future robotic systems operating in real-world environments will require on-board embodied intelligence without continuous cloud connection, balancing capabilities with constraints on computational power and memory. This work presents an extension of the R1-zero approach, which enables the usage of low parameter-count Large Language Models (LLMs) in the robotic domain. The R1-Zero approach was originally developed to enable mathematical reasoning in LLMs using static datasets. We extend it to the robotics domain through integration in a closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. This extension enhances reasoning in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) settings without relying solely on distillation of large models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We show that small-scale LLMs can achieve effective reasoning performance by learning through closed-loop interaction with their environment, which enables tasks that previously required significantly larger models. In an autonomous driving setting, a performance gain of 20.2%-points over the SFT-based baseline is observed with a Qwen2.5-1.5B model. Using the proposed training procedure, Qwen2.5-3B achieves a 63.3% control adaptability score, surpassing the 58.5% obtained by the much larger, cloud-bound GPT-4o. These results highlight that practical, on-board deployment of small LLMs is not only feasible but can outperform larger models if trained through environmental feedback, underscoring the importance of an interactive learning framework for robotic Embodied AI, one grounded in practical experience rather than static supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scenethesis: A Language and Vision Agentic Framework for 3D Scene Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02836v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing interactive 3D scenes from text is essential for gaming, virtual reality, and embodied AI. However, existing methods face several challenges. Learning-based approaches depend on small-scale indoor datasets, limiting the scene diversity and layout complexity. While large language models (LLMs) can leverage diverse text-domain knowledge, they struggle with spatial realism, often producing unnatural object placements that fail to respect common sense. Our key insight is that vision perception can bridge this gap by providing realistic spatial guidance that LLMs lack. To this end, we introduce Scenethesis, a training-free agentic framework that integrates LLM-based scene planning with vision-guided layout refinement. Given a text prompt, Scenethesis first employs an LLM to draft a coarse layout. A vision module then refines it by generating an image guidance and extracting scene structure to capture inter-object relations. Next, an optimization module iteratively enforces accurate pose alignment and physical plausibility, preventing artifacts like object penetration and instability. Finally, a judge module verifies spatial coherence. Comprehensive experiments show that Scenethesis generates diverse, realistic, and physically plausible 3D interactive scenes, making it valuable for virtual content creation, simulation environments, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

Achieving these quality standards, however, necessitates the precise replication of real-world object diversity. Existing datasets demonstrate that this process heavily relies on artist-driven designs, which demand substantial human effort and present significant scalability challenges. To scalably produce realistic and interactive 3D scenes, we first present MetaScenes, a large-scale, simulatable 3D scene dataset constructed from real-world scans, which includes 15366 objects spanning 831 fine-grained categories. Then, we introduce Scan2Sim, a robust multi-modal alignment model, which enables the automated, high-quality replacement of assets, thereby eliminating the reliance on artist-driven designs for scaling 3D scenes. We further propose two benchmarks to evaluate MetaScenes: a detailed scene synthesis task focused on small item layouts for robotic manipulation and a domain transfer task in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) to validate cross-domain transfer. Results confirm MetaScene's potential to enhance EAI by supporting more generalizable agent learning and sim-to-real applications, introducing new possibilities for EAI research.

A new field called Embodied Artificial Intelligence, which places at the intersection of Computer Vision, Robotics, and Decision Making, has been gaining importance during the last few years, as it aims to foster the development of smart autonomous robots and their deployment in society. The recent availability of large collections of 3D models for photorealistic robotic simulation has allowed faster and safe training of learning-based agents for millions of frames and a careful evaluation of their behavior before deploying the models on real robotic platforms. These intelligent agents are intended to perform a certain task in a possibly unknown environment. To this end, during the training in simulation, the agents learn to perform continuous interactions with the surroundings, such as gathering information from the environment, encoding and extracting useful cues for the task, and performing actions towards the final goal; where every action of the agent influences the interactions. This dissertation follows the complete creation process of embodied agents for indoor environments, from their concept to their implementation and deployment.

Exploring Backdoor Attacks against Embodied LLM-based Decision-Making Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20774v3)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in real-world decision-making tasks for embodied artificial intelligence, especially when fine-tuned to leverage their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities while being tailored to specific applications. However, this fine-tuning process introduces considerable safety and security vulnerabilities, especially in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-based Decision-making systems (BALD) in embodied AI, systematically exploring the attack surfaces and trigger mechanisms. Specifically, we propose three distinct attack mechanisms: word injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection, targeting various components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline. We perform extensive experiments on representative LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2) in autonomous driving and home robot tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and stealthiness of our backdoor triggers across various attack channels, with cases like vehicles accelerating toward obstacles and robots placing knives on beds. Our word and knowledge injection attacks achieve nearly 100% success rate across multiple models and datasets while requiring only limited access to the system. Our scenario manipulation attack yields success rates exceeding 65%, reaching up to 90%, and does not require any runtime system intrusion. We also assess the robustness of these attacks against defenses, revealing their resilience. Our findings highlight critical security vulnerabilities in embodied LLM systems and emphasize the urgent need for safeguarding these systems to mitigate potential risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at ICLR 2025, 31 pages, including main paper, references, and appendix</p></details> |

In this paper, we define IGV as a technology that combines generative capabilities to produce diverse high-quality video content with interactive features that enable user engagement through control signals and responsive feedback. We survey the current landscape of IGV applications, focusing on three major domains: 1) gaming, where IGV enables infinite exploration in virtual worlds; 2) embodied AI, where IGV serves as a physics-aware environment synthesizer for training agents in multimodal interaction with dynamically evolving scenes; and 3) autonomous driving, where IGV provides closed-loop simulation capabilities for safety-critical testing and validation. To guide future development, we propose a comprehensive framework that decomposes an ideal IGV system into five essential modules: Generation, Control, Memory, Dynamics, and Intelligence. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the technical challenges and future directions in realizing each component for an ideal IGV system, such as achieving real-time generation, enabling open-domain control, maintaining long-term coherence, simulating accurate physics, and integrating causal reasoning. We believe that this systematic analysis will facilitate future research and development in the field of IGV, ultimately advancing the technology toward more sophisticated and practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the computational demands of virtual services and the inherent mobility of autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitate real-time migration of Vehicular Embodied Agent AI Twins (VEAATs) between resource-constrained Roadside Units (RSUs). This paper proposes a novel framework for efficient VEAAT migration in VEANETs, combining a multi-leader multi-follower (MLMF) Stackelberg game-theoretic incentive mechanism with a tiny multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm. First, We propose an virtual immersive experience-driven utility model that captures AV-RSU dynamic interactions by integrating AVs' social influence, service complementarity and substitutability, and RSUs' resource allocation strategies to optimize VEAAT migration decisions. Second, to enhance training efficiency and enable efficient deployment on computation-constrained AVs while preserving exploration-exploitation performance, we propose TinyMA-IEI-PPO, a self-adaptive dynamic structured pruning algorithm that dynamically adjusts neuron importance based on agents' exploration incentives. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach achieves convergence comparable to baseline models and closely approximates the Stackelberg equilibrium.</p></details> |  |

Unlike offline video understanding, streaming video understanding requires the ability to process video streams frame by frame, preserve historical information, and make low-latency decisions.To address these challenges, our main contributions are three-fold. (i) We develop a novel streaming video backbone, termed as StreamFormer, by incorporating causal temporal attention into a pre-trained vision transformer. This enables efficient streaming video processing while maintaining image representation capability.(ii) To train StreamFormer, we propose to unify diverse spatial-temporal video understanding tasks within a multitask visual-language alignment framework. Hence, StreamFormer learns global semantics, temporal dynamics, and fine-grained spatial relationships simultaneously. (iii) We conduct extensive experiments on online action detection, online video instance segmentation, and video question answering. StreamFormer achieves competitive results while maintaining efficiency, demonstrating its potential for real-time applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

| **[Personalized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) via Neuroscience-Inspired Continuous Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20109v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence has made remarkable advancements in recent years, primarily driven by increasingly large deep learning models. However, achieving true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) demands fundamentally new architectures rather than merely scaling up existing models. Current approaches largely depend on expanding model parameters, which improves task-specific performance but falls short in enabling continuous, adaptable, and generalized learning. Achieving AGI capable of continuous learning and personalization on resource-constrained edge devices is an even bigger challenge. This paper reviews the state of continual learning and neuroscience-inspired AI, and proposes a novel architecture for Personalized AGI that integrates brain-like learning mechanisms for edge deployment. We review literature on continuous lifelong learning, catastrophic forgetting, and edge AI, and discuss key neuroscience principles of human learning, including Synaptic Pruning, Hebbian plasticity, Sparse Coding, and Dual Memory Systems, as inspirations for AI systems. Building on these insights, we outline an AI architecture that features complementary fast-and-slow learning modules, synaptic self-optimization, and memory-efficient model updates to support on-device lifelong adaptation. Conceptual diagrams of the proposed architecture and learning processes are provided. We address challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, memory efficiency, and system scalability, and present application scenarios for mobile AI assistants and embodied AI systems like humanoid robots. We conclude with key takeaways and future research directions toward truly continual, personalized AGI on the edge. While the architecture is theoretical, it synthesizes diverse findings and offers a roadmap for future implementation.</p></details> | 39 pages, 16 figures |

However, deploying these systems remains challenging due to prolonged runtime latency, limited scalability, and heightened sensitivity, leading to significant system inefficiencies. In this paper, we aim to understand the workload characteristics of embodied agent systems and explore optimization solutions. We systematically categorize these systems into four paradigms and conduct benchmarking studies to evaluate their task performance and system efficiency across various modules, agent scales, and embodied tasks. Our benchmarking studies uncover critical challenges, such as prolonged planning and communication latency, redundant agent interactions, complex low-level control mechanisms, memory inconsistencies, exploding prompt lengths, sensitivity to self-correction and execution, sharp declines in success rates, and reduced collaboration efficiency as agent numbers increase. Leveraging these profiling insights, we suggest system optimization strategies to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of embodied agents across different paradigms. This paper presents the first system-level analysis of embodied AI agents, and explores opportunities for advancing future embodied system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS)</p></details> |

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

Although recent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their capabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and deformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the lack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under diverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for generating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac features a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional tactile sensors \sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip detection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips. Furthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis pipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based on this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm robotic system. Experiments demonstrate that PP-Tac can effectively grasp paper-like objects of varying material, thickness, and stiffness, achieving an overall success rate of 87.5\%. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to grasp paper-like deformable objects using a tactile dexterous hand.

However, current methods, which predominantly depend on sparse 3D point clouds, exhibit limited generalizability and robustness due to their sensitivity to coordinate variations and the inherent sparsity of the data. By contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers high-fidelity, real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead by representing scenes as dense, continuous distributions. This positions 3DGS as a highly effective approach for capturing fine-grained affordance details and improving recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, its full potential remains largely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance datasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning. This dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances, and 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object categories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce AffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning using 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal structure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align 3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat dataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain, while AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen and unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first large-scale 3D Gaussians Affordance Reasoning Benchmark</p></details> |

In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control.

| **[Concept Enhancement Engineering: A Lightweight and Efficient Robust Defense Against Jailbreak Attacks in Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13201v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Intelligence (EI) systems integrated with large language models (LLMs) face significant security risks, particularly from jailbreak attacks that manipulate models into generating harmful outputs or executing unsafe physical actions. Traditional defense strategies, such as input filtering and output monitoring, often introduce high computational overhead or interfere with task performance in real-time embodied scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE), a novel defense framework that leverages representation engineering to enhance the safety of embodied LLMs by dynamically steering their internal activations. CEE operates by (1) extracting multilingual safety patterns from model activations, (2) constructing control directions based on safety-aligned concept subspaces, and (3) applying subspace concept rotation to reinforce safe behavior during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that CEE effectively mitigates jailbreak attacks while maintaining task performance, outperforming existing defense methods in both robustness and efficiency. This work contributes a scalable and interpretable safety mechanism for embodied AI, bridging the gap between theoretical representation engineering and practical security applications. Our findings highlight the potential of latent-space interventions as a viable defense paradigm against emerging adversarial threats in physically grounded AI systems.</p></details> |  |

These models efficiently generate action policies by learning to predict noise. However, conventional Diffusion Policy methods rely on iterative denoising, leading to inefficient inference and slow response times, which hinder real-time robot control. To address these limitations, we propose a Classifier-Free Shortcut Diffusion Policy (CF-SDP) that integrates classifier-free guidance with shortcut-based acceleration, enabling efficient task-specific action generation while significantly improving inference speed. Furthermore, we extend diffusion modeling to the SO(3) manifold in shortcut model, defining the forward and reverse processes in its tangent space with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. This ensures stable and accurate rotational estimation, enhancing the effectiveness of diffusion-based control. Our approach achieves nearly 5x acceleration in diffusion inference compared to DDIM-based Diffusion Policy while maintaining task performance. Evaluations both on the RoboTwin simulation platform and real-world scenarios across various tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 Workshop on 2nd MEIS</p></details> |

| **[Reinforcement Learning with Segment Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01876v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard reinforcement learning (RL) assumes that an agent can observe a reward for each state-action pair. However, in practical applications, it is often difficult and costly to collect a reward for each state-action pair. While there have been several works considering RL with trajectory feedback, it is unclear if trajectory feedback is inefficient for learning when trajectories are long. In this work, we consider a model named RL with segment feedback, which offers a general paradigm filling the gap between per-state-action feedback and trajectory feedback. In this model, we consider an episodic Markov decision process (MDP), where each episode is divided into $m$ segments, and the agent observes reward feedback only at the end of each segment. Under this model, we study two popular feedback settings: binary feedback and sum feedback, where the agent observes a binary outcome and a reward sum according to the underlying reward function, respectively. To investigate the impact of the number of segments $m$ on learning performance, we design efficient algorithms and establish regret upper and lower bounds for both feedback settings. Our theoretical and experimental results show that: under binary feedback, increasing the number of segments $m$ decreases the regret at an exponential rate; in contrast, surprisingly, under sum feedback, increasing $m$ does not reduce the regret significantly.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances in enhancing language model (LM) reasoning, most methods lean toward exploitation, and increasingly encounter performance plateaus. In this work, we revisit entropy -- a signal of exploration in RL -- and examine its relationship to exploratory reasoning in LMs. Through empirical analysis, we uncover strong positive correlations between high-entropy regions and three types of exploratory reasoning actions: (1) pivotal tokens that determine or connect logical steps, (2) reflective actions such as self-verification and correction, and (3) rare behaviors under-explored by the base LMs. Motivated by this, we introduce a minimal modification to standard RL with only one line of code: augmenting the advantage function with an entropy-based term. Unlike traditional maximum-entropy methods which encourage exploration by promoting uncertainty, we encourage exploration by promoting longer and deeper reasoning chains. Notably, our method achieves significant gains on the Pass@K metric -- an upper-bound estimator of LM reasoning capabilities -- even when evaluated with extremely large K values, pushing the boundaries of LM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Built upon the publicly available Ling-lite model, a 16.8 billion parameter model with 2.75 billion activated parameters, our approach matches the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) small-scale reasoning models on challenging benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench, GPQA-Diamond) while activating only one-third of the parameters required by comparable models. To accomplish this, we introduce a joint training pipeline integrating distillation with RL, revealing undocumented challenges in MoE RL training. First, we identify optimization instability during RL training, and we propose Constrained Contextual Computation Policy Optimization(C3PO), a novel approach that enhances training stability and improves computational throughput via algorithm-system co-design methodology. Second, we empirically demonstrate that selecting distillation checkpoints based on entropy loss for RL training, rather than validation metrics, yields superior performance-efficiency trade-offs in subsequent RL training. Finally, we develop a two-stage training paradigm to harmonize multi-domain data integration, addressing domain conflicts that arise in training with mixed dataset. We will release the model, dataset, and code.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Current generative models of music produce expressive output but are not able to generate in an \emph{online} manner, meaning simultaneously with other musicians (human or otherwise). We propose ReaLchords, an online generative model for improvising chord accompaniment to user melody. We start with an online model pretrained by maximum likelihood, and use reinforcement learning to finetune the model for online use. The finetuning objective leverages both a novel reward model that provides feedback on both harmonic and temporal coherency between melody and chord, and a divergence term that implements a novel type of distillation from a teacher model that can see the future melody. Through quantitative experiments and listening tests, we demonstrate that the resulting model adapts well to unfamiliar input and produce fitting accompaniment. ReaLchords opens the door to live jamming, as well as simultaneous co-creation in other modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2024</p></details> |

To explore this, we used the game Overcooked AI to create dynamic teaming scenarios featuring varying agent behaviors (clumsy, rigid, adaptive) and environmental complexities (low, medium, high). Our objectives were to assess the performance of adaptive AI agents designed with hierarchical reinforcement learning for better teamwork and measure eye tracking signals related to changes in trust and collaboration. The results indicate that the adaptive agent was more effective in managing teaming and creating an equitable task distribution across environments compared to the other agents. Working with the adaptive agent resulted in better coordination, reduced collisions, more balanced task contributions, and higher trust ratings. Reduced gaze allocation, across all agents, was associated with higher trust levels, while blink count, scan path length, agent revisits and trust were predictive of the humans contribution to the team. Notably, fixation revisits on the agent increased with environmental complexity and decreased with agent versatility, offering a unique metric for measuring teammate performance monitoring. These findings underscore the importance of designing autonomous teammates that not only excel in task performance but also enhance teamwork by being more predictable and reducing the cognitive load on human team members. Additionally, this study highlights the potential of eye-tracking as an unobtrusive measure for evaluating and improving human-autonomy teams, suggesting eye gaze could be used by agents to dynamically adapt their behaviors.</p></details> |  |

Existing captioning methods for scientific figures rely on figure-caption pairs extracted from documents for training, many of which fall short with respect to metrics like helpfulness, explainability, and visual-descriptiveness [15] leading to generated captions being misaligned with reader preferences. To enable the generation of high-quality figure captions, we introduce FigCaps-HF a new framework for figure-caption generation that can incorporate domain expert feedback in generating captions optimized for reader preferences. Our framework comprises of 1) an automatic method for evaluating quality of figure-caption pairs, 2) a novel reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) method to optimize a generative figure-to-caption model for reader preferences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our simple learning framework by improving performance over standard fine-tuning across different types of models. In particular, when using BLIP as the base model, our RLHF framework achieves a mean gain of 35.7%, 16.9%, and 9% in ROUGE, BLEU, and Meteor, respectively. Finally, we release a large-scale benchmark dataset with human feedback on figure-caption pairs to enable further evaluation and development of RLHF techniques for this problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures.

However, poor feedback- and sample- efficiency still remain the problems that hinder the application of PbRL. In this paper, we present a novel efficient query selection and preference-guided exploration method, called SENIOR, which could select the meaningful and easy-to-comparison behavior segment pairs to improve human feedback-efficiency and accelerate policy learning with the designed preference-guided intrinsic rewards. Our key idea is twofold: (1) We designed a Motion-Distinction-based Selection scheme (MDS). It selects segment pairs with apparent motion and different directions through kernel density estimation of states, which is more task-related and easy for human preference labeling; (2) We proposed a novel preference-guided exploration method (PGE). It encourages the exploration towards the states with high preference and low visits and continuously guides the agent achieving the valuable samples. The synergy between the two mechanisms could significantly accelerate the progress of reward and policy learning. Our experiments show that SENIOR outperforms other five existing methods in both human feedback-efficiency and policy convergence speed on six complex robot manipulation tasks from simulation and four real-worlds.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Real-world production environments introduce additional complexities that cause traditional scheduling approaches to be less effective. Reinforcement learning (RL) holds potential in addressing these challenges, as it allows agents to learn adaptive scheduling strategies. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive, general-purpose frameworks for effectively training and evaluating RL agents under real-world constraints. To address this gap, we propose a modular framework that extends classical JSSP formulations by incorporating key real-world constraints inherent to the shopfloor, including transport logistics, buffer management, machine breakdowns, setup times, and stochastic processing conditions, while also supporting multi-objective optimization. The framework is a customizable solution that offers flexibility in defining problem instances and configuring simulation parameters, enabling adaptation to diverse production scenarios. A standardized interface ensures compatibility with various RL approaches, providing a robust environment for training RL agents and facilitating the standardized comparison of different scheduling methods under dynamic and uncertain conditions.

| **[TGDPO: Harnessing Token-Level Reward Guidance for Enhancing Direct Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14574v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reinforcement learning from human feedback have shown that utilizing fine-grained token-level reward models can substantially enhance the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in aligning large language models. However, it is challenging to leverage such token-level reward as guidance for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), since DPO is formulated as a sequence-level bandit problem. To address this challenge, this work decomposes the sequence-level PPO into a sequence of token-level proximal policy optimization problems and then frames the problem of token-level PPO with token-level reward guidance, from which closed-form optimal token-level policy and the corresponding token-level reward can be derived. Using the obtained reward and Bradley-Terry model, this work establishes a framework of computable loss functions with token-level reward guidance for DPO, and proposes a practical reward guidance based on the induced DPO reward. This formulation enables different tokens to exhibit varying degrees of deviation from reference policy based on their respective rewards. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance improvements over DPO, with win rate gains of up to 7.5 points on MT-Bench, 6.2 points on AlpacaEval 2, and 4.3 points on Arena-Hard.

Meanwhile, human have free wills and usually do not make the same decisions even situate in the exactly same scenarios, leading to the data-driven methods suffer from poor migratability and high search cost problems, decreasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the behavior policy. In this research, we propose a safety-first human-like decision-making framework(SF-HLDM) for AVs to drive safely, comfortably, and social compatiblely in effiency. The framework integrates a hierarchical progressive framework, which combines a spatial-temporal attention (S-TA) mechanism for other road users' intention inference, a social compliance estimation module for behavior regulation, and a Deep Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning(DERL) model for expanding the search space efficiently and effectively to make avoidance of falling into the local optimal trap and reduce the risk of overfitting, thus make human-like decisions with interpretability and flexibility. The SF-HLDM framework enables autonomous driving AI agents dynamically adjusts decision parameters to maintain safety margins and adhering to contextually appropriate driving behaviors at the same time.</p></details> |  |

However, the underlying mechanisms of popular ZOO methods, particularly those employing randomized finite differences, and their connection to other optimization paradigms like Reinforcement Learning (RL) are not fully elucidated. This paper establishes a fundamental and previously unrecognized connection: ZOO with finite differences is equivalent to a specific instance of single-step Policy Optimization (PO). We formally unveil that the implicitly smoothed objective function optimized by common ZOO algorithms is identical to a single-step PO objective. Furthermore, we show that widely used ZOO gradient estimators, are mathematically equivalent to the REINFORCE gradient estimator with a specific baseline function, revealing the variance-reducing mechanism in ZOO from a PO perspective.Built on this unified framework, we propose ZoAR (Zeroth-Order Optimization with Averaged Baseline and Query Reuse), a novel ZOO algorithm incorporating PO-inspired variance reduction techniques: an averaged baseline from recent evaluations and query reuse analogous to experience replay. Our theoretical analysis further substantiates these techniques reduce variance and enhance convergence. Extensive empirical studies validate our theory and demonstrate that ZoAR significantly outperforms other methods in terms of convergence speed and final performance. Overall, our work provides a new theoretical lens for understanding ZOO and offers practical algorithmic improvements derived from its connection to PO.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we first introduce a new large-scale rich video human motion 2D dataset (Motion2D-Video-150K) comprising 150,000 video sequences. Motion2D-Video-150K features a balanced distribution of diverse single-character and, crucially, double-character interactive actions, each paired with detailed textual descriptions. Building upon this dataset, we propose a novel diffusion-based rich video human motion2D generation (RVHM2D) model. RVHM2D incorporates an enhanced textual conditioning mechanism utilizing either dual text encoders (CLIP-L/B) or T5-XXL with both global and local features. We devise a two-stage training strategy: the model is first trained with a standard diffusion objective, and then fine-tuned using reinforcement learning with an FID-based reward to further enhance motion realism and text alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RVHM2D achieves leading performance on the Motion2D-Video-150K benchmark in generating both single and interactive double-character scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Skill Discovery through Skill Regions Differentiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14420v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to discover diverse behaviors that can accelerate the learning of downstream tasks. Previous methods typically focus on entropy-based exploration or empowerment-driven skill learning. However, entropy-based exploration struggles in large-scale state spaces (e.g., images), and empowerment-based methods with Mutual Information (MI) estimations have limitations in state exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel skill discovery objective that maximizes the deviation of the state density of one skill from the explored regions of other skills, encouraging inter-skill state diversity similar to the initial MI objective. For state-density estimation, we construct a novel conditional autoencoder with soft modularization for different skill policies in high-dimensional space. Meanwhile, to incentivize intra-skill exploration, we formulate an intrinsic reward based on the learned autoencoder that resembles count-based exploration in a compact latent space. Through extensive experiments in challenging state and image-based tasks, we find our method learns meaningful skills and achieves superior performance in various downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for Unobservable Random Delays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14411v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings, the interaction between the agent and the environment is typically modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that the agent observes the system state instantaneously, selects an action without delay, and executes it immediately. In real-world dynamic environments, such as cyber-physical systems, this assumption often breaks down due to delays in the interaction between the agent and the system. These delays can vary stochastically over time and are typically unobservable, meaning they are unknown when deciding on an action. Existing methods deal with this uncertainty conservatively by assuming a known fixed upper bound on the delay, even if the delay is often much lower. In this work, we introduce the interaction layer, a general framework that enables agents to adaptively and seamlessly handle unobservable and time-varying delays. Specifically, the agent generates a matrix of possible future actions to handle both unpredictable delays and lost action packets sent over networks. Building on this framework, we develop a model-based algorithm, Actor-Critic with Delay Adaptation (ACDA), which dynamically adjusts to delay patterns. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across a wide range of locomotion benchmark environments.</p></details> |  |

Centralized RL suffers from scalability issues, while decentralized approaches often lack unified objectives, resulting in limited network-level efficiency. In this paper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with global adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC. HiLight consists of a high-level Meta-Policy, which partitions the traffic network into subregions and generates sub-goals using a Transformer-LSTM architecture, and a low-level Sub-Policy, which controls individual intersections with global awareness. To improve the alignment between global planning and local execution, we introduce an adversarial training mechanism, where the Meta-Policy generates challenging yet informative sub-goals, and the Sub-Policy learns to surpass these targets, leading to more effective coordination. We evaluate HiLight across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale Manhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions, adverse weather, and holiday surges. Experimental results show that HiLight exhibits significant advantages in large-scale scenarios and remains competitive across standard benchmarks of varying sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntelliLung: Advancing Safe Mechanical Ventilation using Offline RL with Hybrid Actions and Clinically Aligned Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14375v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is a life-sustaining therapy for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, optimizing its settings remains a complex and error-prone process due to patient-specific variability. While Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows promise for MV control, current stateof-the-art (SOTA) methods struggle with the hybrid (continuous and discrete) nature of MV actions. Discretizing the action space limits available actions due to exponential growth in combinations and introduces distribution shifts that can compromise safety. In this paper, we propose optimizations that build upon prior work in action space reduction to address the challenges of discrete action spaces. We also adapt SOTA offline RL algorithms (IQL and EDAC) to operate directly on hybrid action spaces, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of discretization. Additionally, we introduce a clinically grounded reward function based on ventilator-free days and physiological targets, which provides a more meaningful optimization objective compared to traditional sparse mortality-based rewards. Our findings demonstrate that AI-assisted MV optimization may enhance patient safety and enable individualized lung support, representing a significant advancement toward intelligent, data-driven critical care solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review, PAIS track @ ECAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[QuantFactor REINFORCE: Mining Steady Formulaic Alpha Factors with Variance-bounded REINFORCE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05144v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alpha factor mining aims to discover investment signals from the historical financial market data, which can be used to predict asset returns and gain excess profits. Powerful deep learning methods for alpha factor mining lack interpretability, making them unacceptable in the risk-sensitive real markets. Formulaic alpha factors are preferred for their interpretability, while the search space is complex and powerful explorative methods are urged. Recently, a promising framework is proposed for generating formulaic alpha factors using deep reinforcement learning, and quickly gained research focuses from both academia and industries. This paper first argues that the originally employed policy training method, i.e., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), faces several important issues in the context of alpha factors mining. Herein, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm based on the well-known REINFORCE algorithm is proposed. REINFORCE employs Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the policy gradient-yielding unbiased but high variance estimates. The minimal environmental variability inherent in the underlying state transition function, which adheres to the Dirac distribution, can help alleviate this high variance issue, making REINFORCE algorithm more appropriate than PPO. A new dedicated baseline is designed to theoretically reduce the commonly suffered high variance of REINFORCE. Moreover, the information ratio is introduced as a reward shaping mechanism to encourage the generation of steady alpha factors that can better adapt to changes in market volatility. Evaluations on real assets data indicate the proposed algorithm boosts correlation with returns by 3.83\%, and a stronger ability to obtain excess returns compared to the latest alpha factors mining methods, which meets the theoretical results well.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Incentivizing Reasoning for Advanced Instruction-Following of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01413v4)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Codes and data will be available later (under review).

| **[Patho-R1: A Multimodal Reinforcement Learning-Based Pathology Expert Reasoner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11404v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled broad progress in the general medical field. However, pathology still remains a more challenging subdomain, with current pathology specific VLMs exhibiting limitations in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning plausibility. Such shortcomings are largely attributable to the nature of current pathology datasets, which are primarily composed of image description pairs that lack the depth and structured diagnostic paradigms employed by real world pathologists. In this study, we leverage pathology textbooks and real world pathology experts to construct high-quality, reasoning-oriented datasets. Building on this, we introduce Patho-R1, a multimodal RL-based pathology Reasoner, trained through a three-stage pipeline: (1) continued pretraining on 3.5 million image-text pairs for knowledge infusion; (2) supervised fine-tuning on 500k high-quality Chain-of-Thought samples for reasoning incentivizing; (3) reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization and Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization strategies for multimodal reasoning quality refinement. To further assess the alignment quality of our dataset, we propose Patho-CLIP, trained on the same figure-caption corpus used for continued pretraining. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that both Patho-CLIP and Patho-R1 achieve robust performance across a wide range of pathology-related tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, Visual Question Answering, and Multiple Choice Question. Our project is available at the Patho-R1 repository: https://github.com/Wenchuan-Zhang/Patho-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADRD: LLM-Driven Autonomous Driving Based on Rule-based Decision Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14299v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to construct an interpretable autonomous driving decision-making system has become a focal point in academic research. In this study, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate executable, rule-based decision systems to address this challenge. Specifically, harnessing the strong reasoning and programming capabilities of LLMs, we introduce the ADRD(LLM-Driven Autonomous Driving Based on Rule-based Decision Systems) framework, which integrates three core modules: the Information Module, the Agents Module, and the Testing Module. The framework operates by first aggregating contextual driving scenario information through the Information Module, then utilizing the Agents Module to generate rule-based driving tactics. These tactics are iteratively refined through continuous interaction with the Testing Module. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that ADRD exhibits superior performance in autonomous driving decision tasks. Compared to traditional reinforcement learning approaches and the most advanced LLM-based methods, ADRD shows significant advantages in terms of interpretability, response speed, and driving performance. These results highlight the framework's ability to achieve comprehensive and accurate understanding of complex driving scenarios, and underscore the promising future of transparent, rule-based decision systems that are easily modifiable and broadly applicable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates large language models with rule-based systems for autonomous driving decision-making, and our findings validate its potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that explicitly enhances reasoning and self-correction in speech language models for ASR. Our approach combines curriculum learning for progressive capability acquisition, Chain-of-Thought data augmentation to foster intermediate reflection, and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to further refine self-correction through reward-driven optimization. This approach achieves substantial improvements over the official challenge baselines. On the evaluation set, our best system attains a WER/CER of 11.57% for Track 1 and a tcpWER/tcpCER of 17.67% for Track 2. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component under challenge constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL-Obfuscation: Can Language Models Learn to Evade Latent-Space Monitors?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14261v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent-space monitors aim to detect undesirable behaviours in large language models by leveraging internal model representations rather than relying solely on black-box outputs. These methods have shown promise in identifying behaviours such as deception and unsafe completions, but a critical open question remains: can LLMs learn to evade such monitors? To study this, we introduce RL-Obfuscation, in which LLMs are finetuned via reinforcement learning to bypass latent-space monitors while maintaining coherent generations. We apply RL-Obfuscation to LLMs ranging from 7B to 14B parameters and evaluate evasion success against a suite of monitors. We find that token-level latent-space monitors are highly vulnerable to this attack. More holistic monitors, such as max-pooling or attention-based probes, remain robust. Moreover, we show that adversarial policies trained to evade a single static monitor generalise to unseen monitors of the same type. Finally, we study how the policy learned by RL bypasses these monitors and find that the model can also learn to repurpose tokens to mean something different internally.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards Implicitly Incentivizes Correct Reasoning in Base LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14245v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a critical paradox clouds its efficacy: RLVR-tuned models often underperform their base models on the $Pass@K$ metric for solution-finding, leading to the hypothesis that RLVR merely re-weights existing reasoning paths at the cost of reasoning diversity. In this work, we resolve this contradiction by identifying the source of the problem: the $Pass@K$ metric itself is a flawed measure of reasoning, as it credits correct final answers that probably arise from inaccurate or incomplete chains of thought (CoTs). To address this, we introduce a more precise evaluation metric, $CoT$-$Pass@K$, which mandates that both the reasoning path and the final answer be correct. We provide a new theoretical foundation that formalizes how RLVR, unlike traditional RL, is uniquely structured to incentivize logical integrity. Our empirical results are supportive: using $CoT$-$Pass@K$, we observe that RLVR can incentivize the generalization of correct reasoning for all values of $K$. Furthermore, by analyzing the training dynamics, we find that this enhanced reasoning capability emerges early in the training process and smoothly generalizes. Our work provides a clear perspective on the role of RLVR, offers a more reliable method for its evaluation, and confirms its potential to genuinely advance machine reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Accelerating RLHF Training with Reward Variance Increase](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23247v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an essential technique for ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are aligned with human values and preferences during the post-training phase. As an effective RLHF approach, group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated success in many LLM-based applications. However, efficient GRPO-based RLHF training remains a challenge. Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial policy model leads to faster RLHF training. Inspired by this finding, we propose a practical reward adjustment model to accelerate RLHF training by provably increasing the reward variance and preserving the relative preferences and reward expectation. Our reward adjustment method inherently poses a nonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve in general. To overcome the computational challenges, we design a novel $O(n \log n)$ algorithm to find a global solution of the nonconvex reward adjustment model by explicitly characterizing the extreme points of the feasible set. As an important application, we naturally integrate this reward adjustment model into the GRPO algorithm, leading to a more efficient GRPO with reward variance increase (GRPOVI) algorithm for RLHF training. As an interesting byproduct, we provide an indirect explanation for the empirical effectiveness of GRPO with rule-based reward for RLHF training, as demonstrated in DeepSeek-R1. Experiment results demonstrate that the GRPOVI algorithm can significantly improve the RLHF training efficiency compared to the original GRPO algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does DQN Learn?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13617v5)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A primary requirement for any reinforcement learning method is that it should produce policies that improve upon the initial guess. In this work, we show that the widely used Deep Q-Network (DQN) fails to satisfy this minimal criterion -- even when it gets to see all possible states and actions infinitely often (a condition under which tabular Q-learning is guaranteed to converge to the optimal Q-value function). Our specific contributions are twofold. First, we numerically show that DQN often returns a policy that performs worse than the initial one. Second, we offer a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon in linear DQN, a simplified version of DQN that uses linear function approximation in place of neural networks while retaining the other key components such as $\epsilon$-greedy exploration, experience replay, and target network. Using tools from differential inclusion theory, we prove that the limit points of linear DQN correspond to fixed points of projected Bellman operators. Crucially, we show that these fixed points need not relate to optimal -- or even near-optimal -- policies, thus explaining linear DQN's sub-optimal behaviors. We also give a scenario where linear DQN always identifies the worst policy. Our work fills a longstanding gap in understanding the convergence behaviors of Q-learning with function approximation and $\epsilon$-greedy exploration.</p></details> | 24 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Reward Shaping to Mitigate Reward Hacking in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18770v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to \emph{reward hacking}, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. Although reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests two key design principles: (1) the RL reward should be bounded, and (2) the RL reward benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model as the signal for reinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B, and Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF. Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate of at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training.

To address this issue, coordination of multi access points (APs) has been considered to enable coordinated spatial reuse (CSR) in next generation wireless local area networks. This paper tackles the challenge of downlink spatial reuse in Wi-Fi networks, specifically in scenarios involving overlapping basic service sets, by employing hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (HMARL). We decompose the CSR process into two phases, i.e., a polling phase and a decision phase, and introduce the HMARL algorithm to enable efficient CSR. To enhance training efficiency, the proposed HMARL algorithm employs a hierarchical structure, where station selection and power control are determined by a high- and low-level policy network, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that this approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of throughput and latency across various network topologies. Moreover, the algorithm exhibits robust performance when coexisting with legacy APs. Additional experiments in a representative topology further reveal that the carefully designed reward function not only maximizes the overall network throughput, but also improves fairness in transmission opportunities for APs in high-interference regions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore methods that train reward models using both unlabeled and labeled data. Building on the generative models in LLMs, we develop a generative reward model that is first trained via large-scale unsupervised learning and then fine-tuned via supervised learning. We also show that by using label smoothing, we are in fact optimizing a regularized pairwise ranking loss. This result, in turn, provides a new view of training reward models, which links generative models and discriminative models under the same class of training objectives. The outcome of these techniques is a foundation reward model, which can be applied to a wide range of tasks with little or no further fine-tuning effort. Extensive experiments show that this model generalizes well across several tasks, including response ranking, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and task adaptation with fine-tuning, achieving significant performance improvements over several strong baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

Recently, learning-based methods, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), garnered substantial success in the quest for more efficient traffic signal control strategies. However, the design of rewards in DRL highly demands domain knowledge to converge to an effective policy, and the final policy also presents difficulties in terms of explainability. In this work, a new learning-based method for signal control in complex intersections is proposed. In our approach, we design a concept of phase urgency for each signal phase. During signal transitions, the traffic light control strategy selects the next phase to be activated based on the phase urgency. We then proposed to represent the urgency function as an explainable tree structure. The urgency function can calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. Genetic programming is adopted to perform gradient-free optimization of the urgency function. We test our algorithm on multiple public traffic signal control datasets. The experimental results indicate that the tree-shaped urgency function evolved by genetic programming outperforms the baselines, including a state-of-the-art method in the transportation field and a well-known DRL-based method. Our code is available online.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Affective-CARA, an agentic framework designed to enhance user-agent interactions by integrating a Cultural Emotion Knowledge Graph (derived from StereoKG) with Valence, Arousal, and Dominance annotations, culture-specific data, and cross-cultural checks to minimize bias. A Gradient-Based Reward Policy Optimization mechanism further refines responses according to cultural alignment, affective appropriateness, and iterative user feedback. A Cultural-Aware Response Mediator coordinates knowledge retrieval, reinforcement learning updates, and historical data fusion. By merging real-time user input with past emotional states and cultural insights, Affective-CARA delivers narratives that are deeply personalized and sensitive to diverse cultural norms. Evaluations on AffectNet, SEMAINE DB, and MERD confirm that the framework consistently outperforms baseline models in sentiment alignment, cultural adaptation, and narrative quality. Affective-CARA achieved a Cultural Semantic Density of 9.32 out of 10 and lowered cultural representation bias by 61% (KL-Divergence: 0.28), demonstrating robust performance in generating ethical, adaptive responses. These findings suggest the potential for more inclusive and empathetic interactions, making Affective-CARA an avenue for fostering culturally grounded user experiences across domains such as cross-cultural communication, mental health support, and education.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMedAgent-RL: Optimizing Multi-Agent Collaboration for Multimodal Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00555v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 20.7% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.</p></details> |  |

We describe the environment's setup, including agent actions, hierarchical controls, and reward design across different combat modes such as No Weapon and ShootMissile. Two representative algorithms are evaluated: HAPPO, an on-policy hierarchical variant of PPO, and HASAC, an off-policy method based on soft actor-critic. We analyze their training stability, reward progression, and inter-agent coordination capabilities. Experimental results show that HASAC performs well in simpler coordination tasks without weapons, while HAPPO demonstrates stronger adaptability in more dynamic and expressive scenarios involving missile combat. These findings provide insights into the trade-offs between on-policy and off-policy methods in multi-agent settings.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we reveal a subtle yet impactful weakness in these aligned models. We find that simply appending multiple end of sequence (eos) tokens can cause a phenomenon we call context segmentation, which effectively shifts both harmful and benign inputs closer to the refusal boundary in the hidden space. Building on this observation, we propose a straightforward method to BOOST jailbreak attacks by appending eos tokens. Our systematic evaluation shows that this strategy significantly increases the attack success rate across 8 representative jailbreak techniques and 16 open-source LLMs, ranging from 2B to 72B parameters. Moreover, we develop a novel probing mechanism for commercial APIs and discover that major providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Qwen do not filter eos tokens, making them similarly vulnerable. These findings highlight a hidden yet critical blind spot in existing alignment and content filtering approaches. We call for heightened attention to eos tokens' unintended influence on model behaviors, particularly in production systems. Our work not only calls for an input-filtering based defense, but also points to new defenses that make refusal boundaries more robust and generalizable, as well as fundamental alignment techniques that can defend against context segmentation attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published at USENIX Security 25</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel framework, SCRL, to address this problem. We formalize situational constraints as logic implications and develop a new algorithm that dynamically penalizes constraint violations. To handle situational constraints effectively, we propose a probabilistic selection mechanism to overcome limitations of traditional constraint reinforcement learning (CRL) approaches. We evaluate SCRL across two scenarios: medical resource allocation during a pandemic and pesticide distribution in agriculture. Experiments demonstrate that SCRL outperforms existing baselines in satisfying constraints while maintaining high resource efficiency, showcasing its potential for real-world, context-sensitive decision-making tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer flexibility to define precise motion but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) handles high-dimensional spaces with strong robustness but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. Opt2Skill generates dynamic feasible and contact-consistent reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and trains RL policies to track these optimal trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms baselines that rely on human demonstrations and inverse kinematics-based references, both in motion tracking and task success rates. Furthermore, we show that incorporating trajectories with torque information improves contact force tracking in contact-involved tasks, such as wiping a table. We have successfully transferred our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

While longer reasoning helps with thorough exploration of solution paths for complex problems, it also often leads to inefficient and redundant outputs--a phenomenon commonly described as overthinking. In this paper, we propose ShorterBetter, a simple yet effective reinforcement learning method that enables reasoning models to learn their own optimal CoT lengths without manual supervision. We define the Sample Optimal Length (SOL) as the length of the shortest correct response among multiple generations, which serves as a dynamic reward signal to guide the model toward efficient reasoning. Applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B as base models, ShorterBetter achieves 50%-80% reduction in output lengths in both in-domain and out-of-domain reasoning tasks while maintaining accuracy.

We introduce implicit constraint-aware off-policy correction, a framework that embeds structural priors directly inside every Bellman update. The key idea is to compose the optimal Bellman operator with a proximal projection on a convex constraint set, which produces a new operator that (i) remains a $\gamma$-contraction, (ii) possesses a unique fixed point, and (iii) enforces the prescribed structure exactly. A differentiable optimization layer solves the projection; implicit differentiation supplies gradients for deep function approximators at a cost comparable to implicit Q-learning. On a synthetic Bid-Click auction -- where the true value is provably monotone in the bid -- our method eliminates all monotonicity violations and outperforms conservative Q-learning and implicit Q-learning in return, regret, and sample efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample Complexity of the Linear Quadratic Regulator: A Reinforcement Learning Lens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10851v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide the first known algorithm that provably achieves $\varepsilon$-optimality within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon)$ function evaluations for the discounted discrete-time LQR problem with unknown parameters, without relying on two-point gradient estimates. These estimates are known to be unrealistic in many settings, as they depend on using the exact same initialization, which is to be selected randomly, for two different policies. Our results substantially improve upon the existing literature outside the realm of two-point gradient estimates, which either leads to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ rates or heavily relies on stability assumptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Temporal Structure: An Overview of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14045v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing agents capable of exploring, planning and learning in complex open-ended environments is a grand challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) offers a promising solution to this challenge by discovering and exploiting the temporal structure within a stream of experience. The strong appeal of the HRL framework has led to a rich and diverse body of literature attempting to discover a useful structure. However, it is still not clear how one might define what constitutes good structure in the first place, or the kind of problems in which identifying it may be helpful. This work aims to identify the benefits of HRL from the perspective of the fundamental challenges in decision-making, as well as highlight its impact on the performance trade-offs of AI agents. Through these benefits, we then cover the families of methods that discover temporal structure in HRL, ranging from learning directly from online experience to offline datasets, to leveraging large language models (LLMs). Finally, we highlight the challenges of temporal structure discovery and the domains that are particularly well-suited for such endeavours.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadrotor Morpho-Transition: Learning vs Model-Based Control Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14039v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadrotor Morpho-Transition, or the act of transitioning from air to ground through mid-air transformation, involves complex aerodynamic interactions and a need to operate near actuator saturation, complicating controller design. In recent work, morpho-transition has been studied from a model-based control perspective, but these approaches remain limited due to unmodeled dynamics and the requirement for planning through contacts. Here, we train an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) controller to learn a morpho-transition policy and demonstrate successful transfer to hardware. We find that the RL control policy achieves agile landing, but only transfers to hardware if motor dynamics and observation delays are taken into account. On the other hand, a baseline MPC controller transfers out-of-the-box without knowledge of the actuator dynamics and delays, at the cost of reduced recovery from disturbances in the event of unknown actuator failures. Our work opens the way for more robust control of agile in-flight quadrotor maneuvers that require mid-air transformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behaviour Discovery and Attribution for Explainable Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14973v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building trust in reinforcement learning (RL) agents requires understanding why they make certain decisions, especially in high-stakes applications like robotics, healthcare, and finance. Existing explainability methods often focus on single states or entire trajectories, either providing only local, step-wise insights or attributing decisions to coarse, episodelevel summaries. Both approaches miss the recurring strategies and temporally extended patterns that actually drive agent behavior across multiple decisions. We address this gap by proposing a fully offline, reward-free framework for behavior discovery and segmentation, enabling the attribution of actions to meaningful and interpretable behavior segments that capture recurring patterns appearing across multiple trajectories. Our method identifies coherent behavior clusters from state-action sequences and attributes individual actions to these clusters for fine-grained, behavior-centric explanations. Evaluations on four diverse offline RL environments show that our approach discovers meaningful behaviors and outperforms trajectory-level baselines in fidelity, human preference, and cluster coherence. Our code is publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Yet existing approaches are constrained by their dependence on hand-crafted skills, extensive parameter tuning, or computationally intensive models unsuitable for onboard use. We introduce GRaD-Nav++, a lightweight Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that runs fully onboard and follows natural-language commands in real time. Our policy is trained in a photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) simulator via Differentiable Reinforcement Learning (DiffRL), enabling efficient learning of low-level control from visual and linguistic inputs. At its core is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) action head, which adaptively routes computation to improve generalization while mitigating forgetting. In multi-task generalization experiments, GRaD-Nav++ achieves a success rate of 83% on trained tasks and 75% on unseen tasks in simulation. When deployed on real hardware, it attains 67% success on trained tasks and 50% on unseen ones. In multi-environment adaptation experiments, GRaD-Nav++ achieves an average success rate of 81% across diverse simulated environments and 67% across varied real-world settings. These results establish a new benchmark for fully onboard Vision-Language-Action (VLA) flight and demonstrate that compact, efficient models can enable reliable, language-guided navigation without relying on external infrastructure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Off-policy Reinforcement Learning in Biological Sequence Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04461v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing biological sequences with desired properties is challenging due to vast search spaces and limited evaluation budgets. Although reinforcement learning methods use proxy models for rapid reward evaluation, insufficient training data can cause proxy misspecification on out-of-distribution inputs. To address this, we propose a novel off-policy search, $\delta$-Conservative Search, that enhances robustness by restricting policy exploration to reliable regions. Starting from high-score offline sequences, we inject noise by randomly masking tokens with probability $\delta$, then denoise them using our policy. We further adapt $\delta$ based on proxy uncertainty on each data point, aligning the level of conservativeness with model confidence. Experimental results show that our conservative search consistently enhances the off-policy training, outperforming existing machine learning methods in discovering high-score sequences across diverse tasks, including DNA, RNA, protein, and peptide design.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Toward Explainable Offline RL: Analyzing Representations in Intrinsically Motivated Decision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13958v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elastic Decision Transformers (EDTs) have proved to be particularly successful in offline reinforcement learning, offering a flexible framework that unifies sequence modeling with decision-making under uncertainty. Recent research has shown that incorporating intrinsic motivation mechanisms into EDTs improves performance across exploration tasks, yet the representational mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a systematic post-hoc explainability framework to analyze how intrinsic motivation shapes learned embeddings in EDTs. Through statistical analysis of embedding properties (including covariance structure, vector magnitudes, and orthogonality), we reveal that different intrinsic motivation variants create fundamentally different representational structures. Our analysis demonstrates environment-specific correlation patterns between embedding metrics and performance that explain why intrinsic motivation improves policy learning. These findings show that intrinsic motivation operates beyond simple exploration bonuses, acting as a representational prior that shapes embedding geometry in biologically plausible ways, creating environment-specific organizational structures that facilitate better decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReinDSplit: Reinforced Dynamic Split Learning for Pest Recognition in Precision Agriculture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13935v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To empower precision agriculture through distributed machine learning (DML), split learning (SL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, partitioning deep neural networks (DNNs) between edge devices and servers to reduce computational burdens and preserve data privacy. However, conventional SL frameworks' one-split-fits-all strategy is a critical limitation in agricultural ecosystems where edge insect monitoring devices exhibit vast heterogeneity in computational power, energy constraints, and connectivity. This leads to straggler bottlenecks, inefficient resource utilization, and compromised model performance. Bridging this gap, we introduce ReinDSplit, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework that dynamically tailors DNN split points for each device, optimizing efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a Q-learning agent acts as an adaptive orchestrator, balancing workloads and latency thresholds across devices to mitigate computational starvation or overload. By framing split layer selection as a finite-state Markov decision process, ReinDSplit convergence ensures that highly constrained devices contribute meaningfully to model training over time. Evaluated on three insect classification datasets using ResNet18, GoogleNet, and MobileNetV2, ReinDSplit achieves 94.31% accuracy with MobileNetV2. Beyond agriculture, ReinDSplit pioneers a paradigm shift in SL by harmonizing RL for resource efficiency, privacy, and scalability in heterogeneous environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Guidance Accelerates Reinforcement Learning of Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13923v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the process through which reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning on verifiable rewards (RLVR) can learn to solve new problems. We find that RLVR drives performance through two main means: (1) by compressing pass@$k$ into pass@1 and (2) via "capability gain" in which models learn to solve new problems that they previously could not solve even at high $k$. We find that while capability gain exists across model scales, learning to solve new problems is primarily driven through self-distillation. We demonstrate these findings across model scales ranging from 0.5B to 72B on >500,000 reasoning problems with prompts and verifiable final answers across math, science, and code domains. We further show that we can significantly improve pass@$k$ rates by leveraging natural language guidance for the model to consider within context while still requiring the model to derive a solution chain from scratch. Based of these insights, we derive $\text{Guide}$ - a new class of online training algorithms. $\text{Guide}$ adaptively incorporates hints into the model's context on problems for which all rollouts were initially incorrect and adjusts the importance sampling ratio for the "off-policy" trajectories in order to optimize the policy for contexts in which the hints are no longer present. We describe variants of $\text{Guide}$ for GRPO and PPO and empirically show that Guide-GRPO on 7B and 32B parameter models improves generalization over its vanilla counterpart with up to 4$\%$ macro-average improvement across math benchmarks. We include careful ablations to analyze $\text{Guide}$'s components and theoretically analyze Guide's learning efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Whenever, Wherever: Towards Orchestrating Crowd Simulations with Spatio-Temporal Spawn Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16639v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic crowd simulations are essential for immersive virtual environments, relying on both individual behaviors (microscopic dynamics) and overall crowd patterns (macroscopic characteristics). While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Algorithm Distillation for Continuous Control with Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13892v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithm Distillation (AD) was recently proposed as a new approach to perform In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) by modeling across-episodic training histories autoregressively with a causal transformer model. However, due to practical limitations induced by the attention mechanism, experiments were bottlenecked by the transformer's quadratic complexity and limited to simple discrete environments with short time horizons. In this work, we propose leveraging the recently proposed Selective Structured State Space Sequence (S6) models, which achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-range sequence modeling while scaling linearly in sequence length. Through four complex and continuous Meta Reinforcement Learning environments, we demonstrate the overall superiority of Mamba, a model built with S6 layers, over a transformer model for AD. Additionally, we show that scaling AD to very long contexts can improve ICRL performance and make it competitive even with a SOTA online meta RL baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[VL-GenRM: Enhancing Vision-Language Verification via Vision Experts and Iterative Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13888v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with verifiable rewards has advanced large language models but remains underexplored for Vision-Language (VL) models. The Vision-Language Reward Model (VL-RM) is key to aligning VL models by providing structured feedback, yet training effective VL-RMs faces two major challenges. First, the bootstrapping dilemma arises as high-quality training data depends on already strong VL models, creating a cycle where self-generated supervision reinforces existing biases. Second, modality bias and negative example amplification occur when VL models hallucinate incorrect visual attributes, leading to flawed preference data that further misguides training. To address these issues, we propose an iterative training framework leveraging vision experts, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales, and Margin-based Rejection Sampling. Our approach refines preference datasets, enhances structured critiques, and iteratively improves reasoning. Experiments across VL-RM benchmarks demonstrate superior performance in hallucination detection and multimodal reasoning, advancing VL model alignment with reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

Growing neural networks for Policy Mirror Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13862v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Reinforcement Learning (RL), regularization has emerged as a popular tool both in theory and practice, typically based either on an entropy bonus or a Kullback-Leibler divergence that constrains successive policies. In practice, these approaches have been shown to improve exploration, robustness and stability, giving rise to popular Deep RL algorithms such as SAC and TRPO. Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) is a theoretical framework that solves this general regularized policy optimization problem, however the closed-form solution involves the sum of all past Q-functions, which is intractable in practice. We propose and analyze PMD-like algorithms that only keep the last $M$ Q-functions in memory, and show that for finite and large enough $M$, a convergent algorithm can be derived, introducing no error in the policy update, unlike prior deep RL PMD implementations. StaQ, the resulting algorithm, enjoys strong theoretical guarantees and is competitive with deep RL baselines, while exhibiting less performance oscillation, paving the way for fully stable deep RL algorithms and providing a testbed for experimentation with Policy Mirror Descent.</p></details> | 44 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Touch begins where vision ends: Generalizable policies for contact-rich manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13762v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven approaches struggle with precise manipulation; imitation learning requires many hard-to-obtain demonstrations, while reinforcement learning yields brittle, non-generalizable policies. We introduce VisuoTactile Local (ViTaL) policy learning, a framework that solves fine-grained manipulation tasks by decomposing them into two phases: a reaching phase, where a vision-language model (VLM) enables scene-level reasoning to localize the object of interest, and a local interaction phase, where a reusable, scene-agnostic ViTaL policy performs contact-rich manipulation using egocentric vision and tactile sensing. This approach is motivated by the observation that while scene context varies, the low-level interaction remains consistent across task instances. By training local policies once in a canonical setting, they can generalize via a localize-then-execute strategy. ViTaL achieves around 90% success on contact-rich tasks in unseen environments and is robust to distractors. ViTaL's effectiveness stems from three key insights: (1) foundation models for segmentation enable training robust visual encoders via behavior cloning; (2) these encoders improve the generalizability of policies learned using residual RL; and (3) tactile sensing significantly boosts performance in contact-rich tasks. Ablation studies validate each of these insights, and we demonstrate that ViTaL integrates well with high-level VLMs, enabling robust, reusable low-level skills.

| **[Fake it till You Make it: Reward Modeling as Discriminative Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13846v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An effective reward model plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning for post-training enhancement of visual generative models. However, current approaches of reward modeling suffer from implementation complexity due to their reliance on extensive human-annotated preference data or meticulously engineered quality dimensions that are often incomplete and engineering-intensive. Inspired by adversarial training in generative adversarial networks (GANs), this paper proposes GAN-RM, an efficient reward modeling framework that eliminates manual preference annotation and explicit quality dimension engineering. Our method trains the reward model through discrimination between a small set of representative, unpaired target samples(denoted as Preference Proxy Data) and model-generated ordinary outputs, requiring only a few hundred target samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our GAN-RM's effectiveness across multiple key applications including test-time scaling implemented as Best-of-N sample filtering, post-training approaches like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).</p></details> |  |
| **[MARCO: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Conformal Prediction Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13755v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces MARCO (Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning with Conformal Optimization), a novel hardware-aware framework for efficient neural architecture search (NAS) targeting resource-constrained edge devices. By significantly reducing search time and maintaining accuracy under strict hardware constraints, MARCO bridges the gap between automated DNN design and CAD for edge AI deployment. MARCO's core technical contribution lies in its unique combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Conformal Prediction (CP) to accelerate the hardware/software co-design process for deploying deep neural networks. Unlike conventional once-for-all (OFA) supernet approaches that require extensive pretraining, MARCO decomposes the NAS task into a hardware configuration agent (HCA) and a Quantization Agent (QA). The HCA optimizes high-level design parameters, while the QA determines per-layer bit-widths under strict memory and latency budgets using a shared reward signal within a centralized-critic, decentralized-execution (CTDE) paradigm. A key innovation is the integration of a calibrated CP surrogate model that provides statistical guarantees (with a user-defined miscoverage rate) to prune unpromising candidate architectures before incurring the high costs of partial training or hardware simulation. This early filtering drastically reduces the search space while ensuring that high-quality designs are retained with a high probability. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that MARCO achieves a 3-4x reduction in total search time compared to an OFA baseline while maintaining near-baseline accuracy (within 0.3%). Furthermore, MARCO also reduces inference latency. Validation on a MAX78000 evaluation board confirms that simulator trends hold in practice, with simulator estimates deviating from measured values by less than 5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeVERB: Humanoid Whole-Body Control with Latent Vision-Language Instruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13751v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong semantic understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet most existing systems assume an accurate low-level controller with hand-crafted action "vocabulary" such as end-effector pose or root velocity. This assumption confines prior work to quasi-static tasks and precludes the agile, whole-body behaviors required by humanoid whole-body control (WBC) tasks. To capture this gap in the literature, we start by introducing the first sim-to-real-ready, vision-language, closed-loop benchmark for humanoid WBC, comprising over 150 tasks from 10 categories. We then propose LeVERB: Latent Vision-Language-Encoded Robot Behavior, a hierarchical latent instruction-following framework for humanoid vision-language WBC, the first of its kind. At the top level, a vision-language policy learns a latent action vocabulary from synthetically rendered kinematic demonstrations; at the low level, a reinforcement-learned WBC policy consumes these latent verbs to generate dynamics-level commands. In our benchmark, LeVERB can zero-shot attain a 80% success rate on simple visual navigation tasks, and 58.5% success rate overall, outperforming naive hierarchical whole-body VLA implementation by 7.8 times.</p></details> |  |
| **[PB$^2$: Preference Space Exploration via Population-Based Methods in Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13741v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning behaviors from human feedback without predefined reward functions. However, current PbRL methods face a critical challenge in effectively exploring the preference space, often converging prematurely to suboptimal policies that satisfy only a narrow subset of human preferences. In this work, we identify and address this preference exploration problem through population-based methods. We demonstrate that maintaining a diverse population of agents enables more comprehensive exploration of the preference landscape compared to single-agent approaches. Crucially, this diversity improves reward model learning by generating preference queries with clearly distinguishable behaviors, a key factor in real-world scenarios where humans must easily differentiate between options to provide meaningful feedback. Our experiments reveal that current methods may fail by getting stuck in local optima, requiring excessive feedback, or degrading significantly when human evaluators make errors on similar trajectories, a realistic scenario often overlooked by methods relying on perfect oracle teachers. Our population-based approach demonstrates robust performance when teachers mislabel similar trajectory segments and shows significantly enhanced preference exploration capabilities,particularly in environments with complex reward landscapes.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeMaster: Training Time-Series Multimodal LLMs to Reason via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13705v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series reasoning remains a significant challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to the dynamic temporal patterns, ambiguous semantics, and lack of temporal priors. In this work, we introduce TimeMaster, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method that enables time-series MLLMs to perform structured, interpretable reasoning directly over visualized time-series inputs and task prompts. TimeMaster adopts a three-part structured output format, reasoning, classification, and domain-specific extension, and is optimized via a composite reward function that aligns format adherence, prediction accuracy, and open-ended insight quality. The model is trained using a two-stage pipeline: we first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish a good initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) at the token level to enable stable and targeted reward-driven improvement in time-series reasoning. We evaluate TimeMaster on the TimerBed benchmark across six real-world classification tasks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. TimeMaster achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both classical time-series models and few-shot GPT-4o by over 14.6% and 7.3% performance gain, respectively. Notably, TimeMaster goes beyond time-series classification: it also exhibits expert-like reasoning behavior, generates context-aware explanations, and delivers domain-aligned insights. Our results highlight that reward-driven RL can be a scalable and promising path toward integrating temporal understanding into time-series MLLMs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Value-Free Policy Optimization via Reward Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13702v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-trajectory reinforcement learning (RL) methods aim to optimize policies from datasets consisting of (prompt, response, reward) triplets, where scalar rewards are directly available. This supervision format is highly practical, as it mirrors real-world human feedback, such as thumbs-up/down signals, and avoids the need for structured preference annotations. In contrast, pairwise preference-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on datasets with both preferred and dispreferred responses, which are harder to construct and less natural to collect. Among single-trajectory approaches, Direct Reward Optimization (DRO) has shown strong empirical performance due to its simplicity and stability. However, DRO requires approximating a value function, which introduces several limitations: high off-policy variance, coupling between policy and value learning, and a lack of absolute supervision on the policy itself. We introduce Reward Partitioning Optimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing the need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards using a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a straightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary models and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on the policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice. We validate RPO on scalar-feedback language modeling tasks using Flan-T5 encoder-decoder models. Our results demonstrate that RPO outperforms existing single-trajectory baselines such as DRO and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). These findings confirm that RPO is a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded method for single-trajectory policy optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneRec Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13695v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have been widely used in various large-scale user-oriented platforms for many years. However, compared to the rapid developments in the AI community, recommendation systems have not achieved a breakthrough in recent years. For instance, they still rely on a multi-stage cascaded architecture rather than an end-to-end approach, leading to computational fragmentation and optimization inconsistencies, and hindering the effective application of key breakthrough technologies from the AI community in recommendation scenarios. To address these issues, we propose OneRec, which reshapes the recommendation system through an end-to-end generative approach and achieves promising results. Firstly, we have enhanced the computational FLOPs of the current recommendation model by 10 $\times$ and have identified the scaling laws for recommendations within certain boundaries. Secondly, reinforcement learning techniques, previously difficult to apply for optimizing recommendations, show significant potential in this framework. Lastly, through infrastructure optimizations, we have achieved 23.7% and 28.8% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) on flagship GPUs during training and inference, respectively, aligning closely with the LLM community. This architecture significantly reduces communication and storage overhead, resulting in operating expense that is only 10.6% of traditional recommendation pipelines. Deployed in Kuaishou/Kuaishou Lite APP, it handles 25% of total queries per second, enhancing overall App Stay Time by 0.54% and 1.24%, respectively. Additionally, we have observed significant increases in metrics such as 7-day Lifetime, which is a crucial indicator of recommendation experience. We also provide practical lessons and insights derived from developing, optimizing, and maintaining a production-scale recommendation system with significant real-world impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed alphabetically by their first name</p></details> |

Paradoxically though, in many scenarios the naive addition of macro-actions does not lead to better exploration, but rather the opposite. It has been argued that this was caused by adding non-useful macros and multiple works have focused on mechanisms to discover effectively environment-specific useful macros. In this work, we take a slightly different perspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between reducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size of the action space. Namely, one typically treats each potential macro-action as independent and atomic, hence strictly increasing the search space and making typical exploration strategies inefficient. To address this problem we propose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between actions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by reducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving exploration. The term relies on a similarity matrix that is meta-learned jointly with learning the desired policy. We empirically validate our strategy looking at macro-actions in Atari games, and the StreetFighter II environment. Our results show significant improvements over the Rainbow-DQN baseline in all environments. Additionally, we show that the macro-action similarity is transferable to related environments. We believe this work is a small but important step towards understanding how the similarity-imposed geometry on the action space can be exploited to improve credit assignment and exploration, therefore making learning more effective.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Courage to Stop: Overcoming Sunk Cost Fallacy in Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13672v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL) typically leverages replay buffers for reusing past experiences during learning. This can help improve sample efficiency when the collected data is informative and aligned with the learning objectives; when that is not the case, it can have the effect of "polluting" the replay buffer with data which can exacerbate optimization challenges in addition to wasting environment interactions due to wasteful sampling. We argue that sampling these uninformative and wasteful transitions can be avoided by addressing the sunk cost fallacy, which, in the context of deep RL, is the tendency towards continuing an episode until termination. To address this, we propose learn to stop (LEAST), a lightweight mechanism that enables strategic early episode termination based on Q-value and gradient statistics, which helps agents recognize when to terminate unproductive episodes early. We demonstrate that our method improves learning efficiency on a variety of RL algorithms, evaluated on both the MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025)</p></details> |
| **[We Should Identify and Mitigate Third-Party Safety Risks in MCP-Powered Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13666v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models (LLMs) has entered in a experience-driven era, flagged by the emergence of environment feedback-driven learning via reinforcement learning and tool-using agents. This encourages the emergenece of model context protocol (MCP), which defines the standard on how should a LLM interact with external services, such as \api and data. However, as MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces new safety risks. In particular, MCP introduces third-party services, which are not controlled by the LLM developers, into the agent systems. These third-party MCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic incentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In this position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay close attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop new techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our position, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \framework, a controlled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems. (2) We then conduct a series of pilot experiments to demonstrate the safety risks in MCP-powered agent systems is a real threat and its defense is not trivial. (3) Finally, we give our outlook by showing a roadmap to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. In particular, we would call for researchers to persue the following research directions: red teaming, MCP safe LLM development, MCP safety evaluation, MCP safety data accumulation, MCP service safeguard, and MCP safe ecosystem construction. We hope this position paper can raise the awareness of the research community in MCP safety and encourage more researchers to join this important research direction.

Inspired by human problem-solving strategies, CoTT decomposes complex reasoning into modular steps, with the RL agent invoking specific tools, one per step, to iteratively and collaboratively answer sub-questions tackling such tasks as temporal retrieval and multi-modal understanding. We design a two-stage training paradigm involving supervised finetuning (SFT) of a pretrained language model using CoTT data and RL to enable our agent to dynamically propose step-by-step tools for long-range reasoning. To facilitate training, we construct a dataset called Ego-R1 Data, which consists of Ego-CoTT-25K for SFT and Ego-QA-4.4K for RL. Furthermore, our Ego-R1 agent is evaluated on a newly curated week-long video QA benchmark, Ego-R1 Bench, which contains human-verified QA pairs from hybrid sources. Extensive results demonstrate that the dynamic, tool-augmented chain-of-thought reasoning by our Ego-R1 Agent can effectively tackle the unique challenges of understanding ultra-long egocentric videos, significantly extending the time coverage from few hours to a week.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://egolife-ai.github.io/Ego-R1/</p></details> |

Our setting strictly generalizes the episodic setting and is significantly less restrictive than the assumption of bounded hitting time \textit{for all states} made by most previous literature on model-free algorithms in average reward settings. We demonstrate a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(H^5 S\sqrt{AT})$, where $S$ and $A$ are the numbers of states and actions, and $T$ is the horizon. A key technical novelty of our work is the introduction of an $\overline{L}$ operator defined as $\overline{L} v = \frac{1}{H} \sum_{h=1}^H L^h v$ where $L$ denotes the Bellman operator. Under the given assumption, we show that the $\overline{L}$ operator has a strict contraction (in span) even in the average-reward setting where the discount factor is $1$. Our algorithm design uses ideas from episodic Q-learning to estimate and apply this operator iteratively. Thus, we provide a unified view of regret minimization in episodic and non-episodic settings, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, simplified proofs</p></details> |

Unlike traditional single-controller approaches, JAEGER separates the control of the upper and lower bodies into two independent controllers, so that they can better focus on their distinct tasks. This separation alleviates the dimensionality curse and improves fault tolerance. JAEGER supports both root velocity tracking (coarse-grained control) and local joint angle tracking (fine-grained control), enabling versatile and stable movements. To train the controller, we utilize a human motion dataset (AMASS), retargeting human poses to humanoid poses through an efficient retargeting network, and employ a curriculum learning approach. This method performs supervised learning for initialization, followed by reinforcement learning for further exploration. We conduct our experiments on two humanoid platforms and demonstrate the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation and real environments.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention mechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model, which contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters activated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1 million tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning attention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time compute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that require processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including sandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to M1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel RL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling weights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants. Combining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on 512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just $534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K thinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate phase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our models are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the original DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex software engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks. We publicly release MiniMax-M1 at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M1.</p></details> | <details><summary>A tec...</summary><p>A technical report from MiniMax.

Human observers' inferences about Reinforcement Learning agents' learning processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13583v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often exhibit learning behaviors that are not intuitively interpretable by human observers, which can result in suboptimal feedback in collaborative teaching settings. Yet, how humans perceive and interpret RL agent's learning behavior is largely unknown. In a bottom-up approach with two experiments, this work provides a data-driven understanding of the factors of human observers' understanding of the agent's learning process. A novel, observation-based paradigm to directly assess human inferences about agent learning was developed. In an exploratory interview study (\textit{N}=9), we identify four core themes in human interpretations: Agent Goals, Knowledge, Decision Making, and Learning Mechanisms. A second confirmatory study (\textit{N}=34) applied an expanded version of the paradigm across two tasks (navigation/manipulation) and two RL algorithms (tabular/function approximation). Analyses of 816 responses confirmed the reliability of the paradigm and refined the thematic framework, revealing how these themes evolve over time and interrelate. Our findings provide a human-centered understanding of how people make sense of agent learning, offering actionable insights for designing interpretable RL systems and improving transparency in Human-Robot Interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dataless Reinforcement Learning Approach to Rounding Hyperplane Optimization for Max-Cut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13405v4)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem is NP-Complete, and obtaining its optimal solution is NP-hard in the worst case. As a result, heuristic-based algorithms are commonly used, though their design often requires significant domain expertise. More recently, learning-based methods trained on large (un)labeled datasets have been proposed; however, these approaches often struggle with generalizability and scalability. A well-known approximation algorithm for MaxCut is the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm, which relaxes the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation into a semidefinite program (SDP). The GW algorithm then applies hyperplane rounding by uniformly sampling a random hyperplane to convert the SDP solution into binary node assignments. In this paper, we propose a training-data-free approach based on a non-episodic reinforcement learning formulation, in which an agent learns to select improved rounding hyperplanes that yield better cuts than those produced by the GW algorithm. By optimizing over a Markov Decision Process (MDP), our method consistently achieves better cuts across large-scale graphs with varying densities and degree distributions.</p></details> |  |

These platforms are targeted towards a wide range of applications on construction sites involving cranes, with swing-up maneuvers allowing it to perch at a given location, inaccessible with purely the thrust force of the platform. Our proposed approach is based on a hierarchical control framework, which allows different tasks to be executed according to their assigned priorities. An RL agent is then subsequently utilized to adjust the reference set-point of the lower-priority tasks to perform the swing-up maneuver, which is confined in the nullspace of the higher-priority tasks, such as maintaining a specific orientation and position of the end-effector. Our approach is validated using extensive numerical simulation studies.</p></details> | 6 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Language Agents for Hypothesis-driven Clinical Decision Making with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13474v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical decision-making is a dynamic, interactive, and cyclic process where doctors have to repeatedly decide on which clinical action to perform and consider newly uncovered information for diagnosis and treatment. Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this process, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer from one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of immediate availability of all patient information and do not model the interactive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to the limited "out-of-the-box" capabilities of large pre-trained models without performing task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model clinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven uncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis via repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid training paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train LA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical decision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty estimation, and efficient decision-making. We evaluate our methodology on MIMIC-CDM, a real-world dataset covering four abdominal diseases containing various clinical tests and show the benefit of explicitly training clinical decision-making for increasing diagnostic performance and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Two-stage Optimization Method for Wide-range Single-electron Quantum Magnetic Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13469v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum magnetic sensing based on spin systems has emerged as a new paradigm for detecting ultra-weak magnetic fields with unprecedented sensitivity, revitalizing applications in navigation, geo-localization, biology, and beyond. At the heart of quantum magnetic sensing, from the protocol perspective, lies the design of optimal sensing parameters to manifest and then estimate the underlying signals of interest (SoI). Existing studies on this front mainly rely on adaptive algorithms based on black-box AI models or formula-driven principled searches. However, when the SoI spans a wide range and the quantum sensor has physical constraints, these methods may fail to converge efficiently or optimally, resulting in prolonged interrogation times and reduced sensing accuracy. In this work, we report the design of a new protocol using a two-stage optimization method. In the 1st Stage, a Bayesian neural network with a fixed set of sensing parameters is used to narrow the range of SoI. In the 2nd Stage, a federated reinforcement learning agent is designed to fine-tune the sensing parameters within a reduced search space. The proposed protocol is developed and evaluated in a challenging context of single-shot readout of an NV-center electron spin under a constrained total sensing time budget; and yet it achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and resource efficiency for wide-range D.C. magnetic field estimation compared to the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Technical Study into Small Reasoning Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13404v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ongoing evolution of language models has led to the development of large-scale architectures that demonstrate exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks. However, these models come with significant computational and energy demands, as well as potential privacy implications. In this context, Small Reasoning Language Models (SRLMs) with approximately 0.5 billion parameters present a compelling alternative due to their remarkable computational efficiency and cost effectiveness, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Despite these advantages, the limited capacity of 0.5 billion parameter models poses challenges in handling complex tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. This research investigates various training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), knowledge distillation (KD), and reinforcement learning (RL), as well as their hybrid implementations, to enhance the performance of 0.5B SRLMs. We analyze effective methodologies to bridge the performance gap between SRLMS and larger models and present insights into optimal training pipelines tailored for these smaller architectures. Through extensive experimental validation and analysis, our work aims to provide actionable recommendations for maximizing the reasoning capabilities of 0.5B models.</p></details> |  |

MORL based on decomposition is a family of solution methods that employ a number of utility functions to decompose the multi-objective problem into individual single-objective problems solved simultaneously in order to approximate a Pareto front of policies. We focus on the case of linear utility functions parametrised by weight vectors w. We introduce a method based on Upper Confidence Bound to efficiently search for the most promising weight vectors during different stages of the learning process, with the aim of maximising the hypervolume of the resulting Pareto front. The proposed method demonstrates consistency and strong performance across various MORL baselines on Mujoco benchmark problems.

Most of the approaches found in the literature consider the two players to be stationary nodes. Instead, we investigate what happens when they can change location, specifically moving along a linear geometry. We frame this at first as a static game, which can be solved in closed form, and subsequently we extend it to a dynamic game under three different versions for what concerns completeness/perfection of mutual information about the adversary's position, corresponding to different assumptions of concealment/sequentiality of the moves, respectively. We first provide some theoretical conditions that hold for the static game and also help identify good strategies valid under any setup, including dynamic games. Since dynamic games, although more realistic, are characterized by a significantly expanded strategy space, we exploit reinforcement learning to obtain efficient strategies that lead to equilibrium outcomes. We show how theoretical findings can be used to train smart agents to play the game and validate our approach in practical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Achieving Collective Welfare in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Suggestion Sharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12326v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In human society, the conflict between self-interest and collective well-being often obstructs efforts to achieve shared welfare. Related concepts like the Tragedy of the Commons and Social Dilemmas frequently manifest in our daily lives. As artificial agents increasingly serve as autonomous proxies for humans, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method to address this issue - learning policies to maximise collective returns even when individual agents' interests conflict with the collective one. Unlike traditional cooperative MARL solutions that involve sharing rewards, values, and policies or designing intrinsic rewards to encourage agents to learn collectively optimal policies, we propose a novel MARL approach where agents exchange action suggestions. Our method reveals less private information compared to sharing rewards, values, or policies, while enabling effective cooperation without the need to design intrinsic rewards. Our algorithm is supported by our theoretical analysis that establishes a bound on the discrepancy between collective and individual objectives, demonstrating how sharing suggestions can align agents' behaviours with the collective objective. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm performs competitively with baselines that rely on value or policy sharing or intrinsic rewards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning (ECML-PKDD 2025 Journal Track)</p></details> |

Traditional methods rely on OCR and language models, while end-to-end multimodal models offer direct JSON generation. However, domain-specific schemas and high annotation costs limit their effectiveness in medical VIE. We base our approach on the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework to address these challenges using only 100 annotated samples. Our approach ensures dataset diversity, a balanced precision-recall reward mechanism to reduce hallucinations and improve field coverage, and innovative sampling strategies to enhance reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our RLVR method, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on medical VIE tasks, significantly improving F1, precision, and recall. While our models excel on tasks similar to medical datasets, performance drops on dissimilar tasks, highlighting the need for domain-specific optimization. Case studies further demonstrate the value of reasoning during training and inference for VIE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Socratic RL: A Novel Framework for Efficient Knowledge Acquisition through Iterative Reflection and Viewpoint Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13358v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic, outcome-based reward signals (e.g., final answer correctness), which limits the depth of learning from each interaction. This paper introduces Socratic Reinforcement Learning (Socratic-RL), a novel, process-oriented framework designed to address this limitation. Socratic-RL operates on the principle that deeper understanding is achieved by reflecting on the causal reasons for errors and successes within the reasoning process itself. The framework employs a decoupled "Teacher-Student" architecture, where a "Teacher AI" analyzes interaction histories, extracts causal insights, and formulates them into structured "viewpoints." These viewpoints, acting as distilled guidance, are then used by a "Student AI" to enhance its subsequent reasoning. A key innovation is the iterative self-improvement of the Teacher AI, enabling its reflective capabilities to evolve through a meta-learning loop. To manage the accumulation of knowledge, a distillation mechanism compresses learned viewpoints into the Student's parameters. By focusing on process rather than just outcome, Socratic-RL presents a pathway toward enhanced sample efficiency, superior interpretability, and a more scalable architecture for self-improving AI systems. This paper details the foundational concepts, formal mechanisms, synergies, challenges, and a concrete research roadmap for this proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direct Reasoning Optimization: LLMs Can Reward And Refine Their Own Reasoning for Open-Ended Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13351v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning abilities in structured tasks like mathematics and programming, largely driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses outcome-based signals that are scalable, effective, and robust against reward hacking. However, applying similar techniques to open-ended long-form reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of generic, verifiable reward signals. To address this, we propose Direct Reasoning Optimization (DRO), a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning LLMs on open-ended, particularly long-form, reasoning tasks, guided by a new reward signal: the Reasoning Reflection Reward (R3). At its core, R3 selectively identifies and emphasizes key tokens in the reference outcome that reflect the influence of the model's preceding chain-of-thought reasoning, thereby capturing the consistency between reasoning and reference outcome at a fine-grained level. Crucially, R3 is computed internally using the same model being optimized, enabling a fully self-contained training setup. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic data filtering strategy based on R3 for open-ended reasoning tasks, reducing cost while improving downstream performance. We evaluate DRO on two diverse datasets -- ParaRev, a long-form paragraph revision task, and FinQA, a math-oriented QA benchmark -- and show that it consistently outperforms strong baselines while remaining broadly applicable across both open-ended and structured domains.</p></details> |  |

Noise-based exploration generally fares well with dense-shaped rewards and bonus-based exploration with sparse rewards. However, these methods usually require additional tuning to deal with undesirable reward settings by adjusting hyperparameters and noise distributions. Rewards that actively discourage exploration, i.e., with an action cost and no other dense signal to follow, can pose a major challenge. We propose a novel exploration method, Stable Error-seeking Exploration (SEE), that is robust across dense, sparse, and exploration-adverse reward settings. To this endeavor, we revisit the idea of maximizing the TD-error as a separate objective. Our method introduces three design choices to mitigate instability caused by far-off-policy learning, the conflict of interest of maximizing the cumulative TD-error in an episodic setting, and the non-stationary nature of TD-errors. SEE can be combined with off-policy algorithms without modifying the optimization pipeline of the original objective. In our experimental analysis, we show that a Soft-Actor Critic agent with the addition of SEE performs robustly across three diverse reward settings in a variety of tasks without hyperparameter adjustments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RLC 2025, to be published in RLJ</p></details> |

However, current methods are predominantly based on limited single-modal data, which does not fully exploit the potential of multimodal information. This paper presents a novel framework that actively identifies reliable modalities for each sample using task-specific contextual cues, thus significantly improving recognition performance. Our framework integrates an Active Sample Inference (ASI) module, which utilizes active inference to predict reliable modalities based on posterior distributions and subsequently organizes them accordingly. Unlike reinforcement learning, active inference replaces rewards with evidence-based preferences, making more stable predictions. Additionally, we introduce an active mutual distillation module that enhances the representation learning of less reliable modalities by transferring knowledge from more reliable ones. Adaptive multimodal inference is employed during the meta-test to assign higher weights to reliable modalities. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCAI...</summary><p>IJCAI 2025, the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

In robotics, active tactile perception has emerged as an important research domain that complements vision for tasks such as object classification, shape reconstruction, and manipulation. This work introduces TAP (Task-agnostic Active Perception) -- a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) and transformer-based architectures to address the challenges posed by partially observable environments. TAP integrates Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and CrossQ algorithms within a unified optimization objective, jointly training a perception module and decision-making policy. By design, TAP is completely task-agnostic and can, in principle, generalize to any active perception problem. We evaluate TAP across diverse tasks, including toy examples and realistic applications involving haptic exploration of 3D models from the Tactile MNIST benchmark. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of TAP, achieving high accuracies on the Tactile MNIST haptic digit recognition task and a tactile pose estimation task. These findings underscore the potential of TAP as a versatile and generalizable framework for advancing active tactile perception in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages; 13 figures Under Review</p></details> |

This paper introduces a generalizable approach that uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case -- given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop. Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe.

This paper investigates a control strategy that integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize economic benefits in autonomous greenhouses. Previous research has explored the use of RL and MPC for greenhouse control individually, or by using MPC as the function approximator for the RL agent. This study introduces the RL-Guided MPC framework, where a RL policy is trained and then used to construct a terminal cost and terminal region constraint for the MPC optimization problem. This approach leverages the ability to handle uncertainties of RL with MPC's online optimization to improve overall control performance. The RL-Guided MPC framework is compared with both MPC and RL via numerical simulations. Two scenarios are considered: a deterministic environment and an uncertain environment. Simulation results demonstrate that, in both environments, RL-Guided MPC outperforms both RL and MPC with shorter prediction horizons.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the class of convex Markov games that allow general convex preferences over occupancy measures. Despite infinite time horizon and strictly higher generality than Markov games, pure strategy Nash equilibria exist. Furthermore, equilibria can be approximated empirically by performing gradient descent on an upper bound of exploitability. Our experiments reveal novel solutions to classic repeated normal-form games, find fair solutions in a repeated asymmetric coordination game, and prioritize safe long-term behavior in a robot warehouse environment. In the prisoner's dilemma, our algorithm leverages transient imitation to find a policy profile that deviates from observed human play only slightly, yet achieves higher per-player utility while also being three orders of magnitude less exploitable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[ASAP: Learning Generalizable Online Bin Packing via Adaptive Selection After Proposal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17377v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved promising results in solving online 3D Bin Packing Problems (3D-BPP). However, these DRL-based policies may perform poorly on new instances due to distribution shift. Besides generalization, we also consider adaptation, completely overlooked by previous work, which aims at rapidly fine-tuning these policies to a new test distribution. To tackle both generalization and adaptation issues, we propose ASAP, which decomposes a solver's decision-making into two policies, one for proposal and one for selection. The role of the proposal policy is to suggest promising actions, which allows the selection policy to choose among them. To effectively learn these policies, we introduce a training framework that combines pre-training and post-training, enhanced by meta-learning. During online adaptation, we only fine-tune the selection policy to rapidly adapt to a test distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that ASAP exhibits excellent generalization and adaptation capabilities on in-distribution and out-of-distribution instances for both discrete and continuous setups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness of Reinforcement Learning-Based Traffic Signal Control under Incidents: A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13836v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control (RL-TSC) has emerged as a promising approach for improving urban mobility. However, its robustness under real-world disruptions such as traffic incidents remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce T-REX, an open-source, SUMO-based simulation framework for training and evaluating RL-TSC methods under dynamic, incident scenarios. T-REX models realistic network-level performance considering drivers' probabilistic rerouting, speed adaptation, and contextual lane-changing, enabling the simulation of congestion propagation under incidents. To assess robustness, we propose a suite of metrics that extend beyond conventional traffic efficiency measures. Through extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world networks, we showcase T-REX for the evaluation of several state-of-the-art RL-TSC methods under multiple real-world deployment paradigms. Our findings show that while independent value-based and decentralized pressure-based methods offer fast convergence and generalization in stable traffic conditions and homogeneous networks, their performance degrades sharply under incident-driven distribution shifts. In contrast, hierarchical coordination methods tend to offer more stable and adaptable performance in large-scale, irregular networks, benefiting from their structured decision-making architecture. However, this comes with the trade-off of slower convergence and higher training complexity. These findings highlight the need for robustness-aware design and evaluation in RL-TSC research. T-REX contributes to this effort by providing an open, standardized and reproducible platform for benchmarking RL methods under dynamic and disruptive traffic scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Fatigue-Aware Adaptive Interfaces for Wearable Devices Using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13203v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable devices, such as smartwatches and head-mounted displays, are increasingly used for prolonged tasks like remote learning and work, but sustained interaction often leads to user fatigue, reducing efficiency and engagement. This study proposes a fatigue-aware adaptive interface system for wearable devices that leverages deep learning to analyze physiological data (e.g., heart rate, eye movement) and dynamically adjust interface elements to mitigate cognitive load. The system employs multimodal learning to process physiological and contextual inputs and reinforcement learning to optimize interface features like text size, notification frequency, and visual contrast. Experimental results show a 18% reduction in cognitive load and a 22% improvement in user satisfaction compared to static interfaces, particularly for users engaged in prolonged tasks. This approach enhances accessibility and usability in wearable computing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks and Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Resource Allocation for V2X Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06518v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology, Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication has attracted much attention due to its superior performance in coverage, latency, and throughput. Resource allocation within C-V2X is crucial for ensuring the transmission of safety information and meeting the stringent requirements for ultra-low latency and high reliability in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. This paper proposes a method that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to address this challenge. By constructing a dynamic graph with communication links as nodes and employing the Graph Sample and Aggregation (GraphSAGE) model to adapt to changes in graph structure, the model aims to ensure a high success rate for V2V communication while minimizing interference on Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) links, thereby ensuring the successful transmission of V2V link information and maintaining high transmission rates for V2I links. The proposed method retains the global feature learning capabilities of GNN and supports distributed network deployment, allowing vehicles to extract low-dimensional features that include structural information from the graph network based on local observations and to make independent resource allocation decisions. Simulation results indicate that the introduction of GNN, with a modest increase in computational load, effectively enhances the decision-making quality of agents, demonstrating superiority to other methods. This study not only provides a theoretically efficient resource allocation strategy for V2V and V2I communications but also paves a new technical path for resource management in practical IoV environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel merging control scheme based on reinforcement learning, which integrates lateral control mechanisms. This approach ensures the smooth integration of vehicles from the merging lane onto the main road, optimizing both fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Furthermore, we recognize the impact of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication on control strategies and introduce an enhanced protocol leveraging Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Mode 4. This protocol aims to reduce the Age of Information (AoI) and improve communication reliability. In our simulations, we employ two AoI-based metrics to rigorously assess the protocol's effectiveness in autonomous driving scenarios. By combining the NS3 network simulator with Python, we simulate V2V communication and vehicle control simultaneously. The results demonstrate that the enhanced C-V2X Mode 4 outperforms the standard version, while the proposed control scheme ensures safe and reliable vehicle operation during on-ramp merging.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Journal.

| **[Dynamic Preference Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Internet Network Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13153v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An internet network service provider manages its network with multiple objectives, such as high quality of service (QoS) and minimum computing resource usage. To achieve these objectives, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) algorithm has been proposed to train its network management agent. Usually, their algorithms optimize their agents with respect to a single static reward formulation consisting of multiple objectives with fixed importance factors, which we call preferences. However, in practice, the preference could vary according to network status, external concerns and so on. For example, when a server shuts down and it can cause other servers' traffic overloads leading to additional shutdowns, it is plausible to reduce the preference of QoS while increasing the preference of minimum computing resource usages. In this paper, we propose new RL-based network management agents that can select actions based on both states and preferences. With our proposed approach, we expect a single agent to generalize on various states and preferences. Furthermore, we propose a numerical method that can estimate the distribution of preference that is advantageous for unbiased training. Our experiment results show that the RL agents trained based on our proposed approach significantly generalize better with various preferences than the previous RL approaches, which assume static preference during training. Moreover, we demonstrate several analyses that show the advantages of our numerical estimation method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion-R1: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning for Human Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10353v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability, consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1, a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Reinsurance Treaty Bidding via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13113v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for reinsurance treaty bidding, addressing long-standing inefficiencies in traditional broker-mediated placement processes. We pose the core research question: Can autonomous, learning-based bidding systems improve risk transfer efficiency and outperform conventional pricing approaches in reinsurance markets? In our model, each reinsurer is represented by an adaptive agent that iteratively refines its bidding strategy within a competitive, partially observable environment. The simulation explicitly incorporates institutional frictions including broker intermediation, incumbent advantages, last-look privileges, and asymmetric access to underwriting information. Empirical analysis demonstrates that MARL agents achieve up to 15% higher underwriting profit, 20% lower tail risk (CVaR), and over 25% improvement in Sharpe ratios relative to actuarial and heuristic baselines. Sensitivity tests confirm robustness across hyperparameter settings, and stress testing reveals strong resilience under simulated catastrophe shocks and capital constraints. These findings suggest that MARL offers a viable path toward more transparent, adaptive, and risk-sensitive reinsurance markets. The proposed framework contributes to emerging literature at the intersection of algorithmic market design, strategic bidding, and AI-enabled financial decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Overcoming Overfitting in Reinforcement Learning via Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13111v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key challenges that Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces is its limited capability to adapt to a change of data distribution caused by uncertainties. This challenge arises especially in RL systems using deep neural networks as decision makers or policies, which are prone to overfitting after prolonged training on fixed environments. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy (GPDP), a new algorithm that integrates diffusion models and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to represent the policy. GPR guides diffusion models to generate actions that maximize learned Q-function, resembling the policy improvement in RL. Furthermore, the kernel-based nature of GPR enhances the policy's exploration efficiency under distribution shifts at test time, increasing the chance of discovering new behaviors and mitigating overfitting. Simulation results on the Walker2d benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under distribution shift condition by achieving around 67.74% to 123.18% improvement in the RL's objective function while maintaining comparable performance under normal conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, Accepted to IEEE Statistical Signal Processing (SSP) Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Novel ViDAR Device With Visual Inertial Encoder Odometry and Reinforcement Learning-Based Active SLAM Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13100v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of multi-sensor fusion for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), monocular cameras and IMUs are widely used to build simple and effective visual-inertial systems. However, limited research has explored the integration of motor-encoder devices to enhance SLAM performance. By incorporating such devices, it is possible to significantly improve active capability and field of view (FOV) with minimal additional cost and structural complexity. This paper proposes a novel visual-inertial-encoder tightly coupled odometry (VIEO) based on a ViDAR (Video Detection and Ranging) device. A ViDAR calibration method is introduced to ensure accurate initialization for VIEO. In addition, a platform motion decoupled active SLAM method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. Experimental data demonstrate that the proposed ViDAR and the VIEO algorithm significantly increase cross-frame co-visibility relationships compared to its corresponding visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithm, improving state estimation accuracy. Additionally, the DRL-based active SLAM algorithm, with the ability to decouple from platform motion, can increase the diversity weight of the feature points and further enhance the VIEO algorithm's performance. The proposed methodology sheds fresh insights into both the updated platform design and decoupled approach of active SLAM systems in complex environments.</p></details> | 12 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Intra-Trajectory Consistency for Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09096v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However, since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards. We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model, improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification results.

While recent generative frameworks can automatically synthesize task settings, such as 3D scenes and reward functions, they have not yet addressed the challenge of tool-use scenarios. Simply retrieving human-designed tools might not be ideal since many tools (e.g., a rolling pin) are difficult for robotic manipulators to handle. Furthermore, existing tool design approaches either rely on predefined templates with limited parameter tuning or apply generic 3D generation methods that are not optimized for tool creation. To address these limitations, we propose RobotSmith, an automated pipeline that leverages the implicit physical knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) alongside the more accurate physics provided by physics simulations to design and use tools for robotic manipulation. Our system (1) iteratively proposes tool designs using collaborative VLM agents, (2) generates low-level robot trajectories for tool use, and (3) jointly optimizes tool geometry and usage for task performance. We evaluate our approach across a wide range of manipulation tasks involving rigid, deformable, and fluid objects. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both task success rate and overall performance. Notably, our approach achieves a 50.0\% average success rate, significantly surpassing other baselines such as 3D generation (21.4%) and tool retrieval (11.1%). Finally, we deploy our system in real-world settings, demonstrating that the generated tools and their usage plans transfer effectively to physical execution, validating the practicality and generalization capabilities of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Trained on ~1M contact-rich interactions collected with the Digit 360 sensor, Sparsh-X captures complementary touch signals at diverse temporal and spatial scales. By leveraging self-supervised learning, Sparsh-X fuses these modalities into a unified representation that captures physical properties useful for robot manipulation tasks. We study how to effectively integrate real-world touch representations for both imitation learning and tactile adaptation of sim-trained policies, showing that Sparsh-X boosts policy success rates by 63% over an end-to-end model using tactile images and improves robustness by 90% in recovering object states from touch. Finally, we benchmark Sparsh-X ability to make inferences about physical properties, such as object-action identification, material-quantity estimation, and force estimation. Sparsh-X improves accuracy in characterizing physical properties by 48% compared to end-to-end approaches, demonstrating the advantages of multisensory pretraining for capturing features essential for dexterous manipulation.</p></details> |  |

This study presents the first-ever work in Arabic language integration within the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) domain in robotics, an area that has been notably underexplored in existing research. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art multi-lingual Small Language Models (SLMs), including GPT-4o mini, Llama 3 8B, and Phi-3 medium 14B, alongside the Arabic-centric LLM, Jais. Our approach utilizes the NavGPT framework, a pure LLM-based instruction-following navigation agent, to assess the impact of language on navigation reasoning through zero-shot sequential action prediction using the R2R dataset. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of high-level planning for navigation tasks when provided with instructions in both English and Arabic. However, certain models struggled with reasoning and planning in the Arabic language due to inherent limitations in their capabilities, sub-optimal performance, and parsing issues. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing planning and reasoning capabilities in language models for effective navigation, emphasizing this as a key area for further development while also unlocking the potential of Arabic-language models for impactful real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for presentation at LM4Plan@AAAI'25.

This limitation significantly affects depth map and point cloud-reliant applications, especially in robotic manipulation. We developed a vision transformer-based algorithm for stereo depth recovery of transparent objects. This approach is complemented by an innovative feature post-fusion module, which enhances the accuracy of depth recovery by structural features in images. To address the high costs associated with dataset collection for stereo camera-based perception of transparent objects, our method incorporates a parameter-aligned, domain-adaptive, and physically realistic Sim2Real simulation for efficient data generation, accelerated by AI algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate the model's exceptional Sim2Real generalizability in real-world scenarios, enabling precise depth mapping of transparent objects to assist in robotic manipulation.

As biohazard complexity increases, minimizing direct human exposure while maintaining precision becomes essential. We propose GAMORA (Gesture Articulated Meta Operative Robotic Arm), a novel VR-guided robotic system that enables remote execution of hazardous tasks using natural hand gestures. Unlike existing scripted automation or traditional teleoperation, GAMORA integrates the Oculus Quest 2, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, and Robot Operating System (ROS) to provide real-time immersive control, digital twin simulation, and inverse kinematics-based articulation. The system supports VR-based training and simulation while executing precision tasks in physical environments via a 3D-printed robotic arm. Inverse kinematics ensure accurate manipulation for delicate operations such as specimen handling and pipetting. The pipeline includes Unity-based 3D environment construction, real-time motion planning, and hardware-in-the-loop testing. GAMORA achieved a mean positional discrepancy of 2.2 mm (improved from 4 mm), pipetting accuracy within 0.2 mL, and repeatability of 1.2 mm across 50 trials. Integrated object detection via YOLOv8 enhances spatial awareness, while energy-efficient operation (50% reduced power output) ensures sustainable deployment. The system's digital-physical feedback loop enables safe, precise, and repeatable automation of high-risk lab tasks. GAMORA offers a scalable, immersive solution for robotic control and biosafety in biomedical research environments.</p></details> |  |

While many approaches integrate pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) with specialized navigation architectures, the fundamental question remains: can these pretrained embeddings alone successfully guide navigation without additional fine-tuning or specialized modules? We present a minimalist framework that decouples this question by training a behavior cloning policy directly on frozen vision-language embeddings from demonstrations collected by a privileged expert. Our approach achieves a 74% success rate in navigation to language-specified targets, compared to 100% for the state-aware expert, though requiring 3.2 times more steps on average. This performance gap reveals that pretrained embeddings effectively support basic language grounding but struggle with long-horizon planning and spatial reasoning. By providing this empirical baseline, we highlight both the capabilities and limitations of using foundation models as drop-in representations for embodied tasks, offering critical insights for robotics researchers facing practical design tradeoffs between system complexity and performance in resource-constrained scenarios.

The method was rigorously tested in industrial-grade experiments, focusing on the collaborative transport of an engine cowl lip section. Comparative analysis between DMP-generated trajectories and a state-of-the-art motion planner (BiTRRT) highlights their adaptability combined with velocity scaling. Subjective user feedback further demonstrates a clear preference for DMP- based interactions. Objective evaluations, including physiological measurements from brain and skin activity, reinforce these findings, showcasing the advantages of DMPs in enhancing human-robot interaction and improving user experience.</p></details> |  |

Observers based on proprioceptive information can be used for contact detection but have first-order error dynamics, which results in delays. Sensor fusion based on inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of accelerometers and gyroscopes is advantageous for reducing delays. The acceleration estimation enables the direct calculation of external forces. For serial robots, the installation of multiple accelerometers and gyroscopes is required for dynamics modeling since the joint coordinates are the minimal coordinates. Alternatively, parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential to use only one IMU on the end-effector platform, which already presents the minimal coordinates of the PR. This work introduces a sensor-fusion method for contact detection using encoders and only one low-cost, consumer-grade IMU for a PR. The end-effector accelerations are estimated by an extended Kalman filter and incorporated into the dynamics to calculate external forces. In real-world experiments with a planar PR, we demonstrate that this approach reduces the detection duration by up to 50% compared to a momentum observer and enables the collision and clamping detection within 3-39ms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of a publication accepted for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

For multi-arm robotic systems, IK remains challenging due to complex self-collisions, coupled joints, and high-dimensional redundancy. These complexities make traditional IK solvers slow, prone to failure, and lacking in solution diversity. In this paper, we present IKDiffuser, a diffusion-based model designed for fast and diverse IK solution generation for multi-arm robotic systems. IKDiffuser learns the joint distribution over the configuration space, capturing complex dependencies and enabling seamless generalization to multi-arm robotic systems of different structures. In addition, IKDiffuser can incorporate additional objectives during inference without retraining, offering versatility and adaptability for task-specific requirements. In experiments on 6 different multi-arm systems, the proposed IKDiffuser achieves superior solution accuracy, precision, diversity, and computational efficiency compared to existing solvers. The proposed IKDiffuser framework offers a scalable, unified approach to solving multi-arm IK problems, facilitating the potential of multi-arm robotic systems in real-time manipulation tasks.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Socially Aware Robot Crowd Navigation via Online Uncertainty-Driven Risk Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14305v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation in human-robot shared crowded environments remains challenging, as robots are expected to move efficiently while respecting human motion conventions. However, many existing approaches emphasize safety or efficiency while overlooking social awareness. This article proposes Learning-Risk Model Predictive Control (LR-MPC), a data-driven navigation algorithm that balances efficiency, safety, and social awareness. LR-MPC consists of two phases: an offline risk learning phase, where a Probabilistic Ensemble Neural Network (PENN) is trained using risk data from a heuristic MPC-based baseline (HR-MPC), and an online adaptive inference phase, where local waypoints are sampled and globally guided by a Multi-RRT planner. Each candidate waypoint is evaluated for risk by PENN, and predictions are filtered using epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to ensure robust decision-making. The safest waypoint is selected as the MPC input for real-time navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LR-MPC outperforms baseline methods in success rate and social awareness, enabling robots to navigate complex crowds with high adaptability and low disruption.

| **[Whole-Body Control Framework for Humanoid Robots with Heavy Limbs: A Model-Based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14278v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots often face significant balance issues due to the motion of their heavy limbs. These challenges are particularly pronounced when attempting dynamic motion or operating in environments with irregular terrain. To address this challenge, this manuscript proposes a whole-body control framework for humanoid robots with heavy limbs, using a model-based approach that combines a kino-dynamics planner and a hierarchical optimization problem. The kino-dynamics planner is designed as a model predictive control (MPC) scheme to account for the impact of heavy limbs on mass and inertia distribution. By simplifying the robot's system dynamics and constraints, the planner enables real-time planning of motion and contact forces. The hierarchical optimization problem is formulated using Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP) to minimize limb control errors and ensure compliance with the policy generated by the kino-dynamics planner. Experimental validation of the proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness. The humanoid robot with heavy limbs controlled by the proposed framework can achieve dynamic walking speeds of up to 1.2~m/s, respond to external disturbances of up to 60~N, and maintain balance on challenging terrains such as uneven surfaces, and outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, this paper proposes a CBFs-based robust adaptive controller design endowing time-varying constraints while considering parametric uncertainty and additive disturbances. To this end, we first leverage Robust adaptive Control Barrier Functions (RaCBFs) to handle model uncertainty, along with the concept of Input-to-State Safety (ISSf) to ensure robustness towards input disturbances. Furthermore, to alleviate the inherent conservatism in robustness, we also incorporate a set membership identification scheme. We demonstrate the proposed method on robotic surface treatment that requires time-varying force bounds to ensure uniform quality, in numerical simulation and real robotic setup, showing that the quality is formally guaranteed within an acceptable range.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to ECC 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Novel Indicator for Quantifying and Minimizing Information Utility Loss of Robot Teams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14237v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The timely exchange of information among robots within a team is vital, but it can be constrained by limited wireless capacity. The inability to deliver information promptly can result in estimation errors that impact collaborative efforts among robots. In this paper, we propose a new metric termed Loss of Information Utility (LoIU) to quantify the freshness and utility of information critical for cooperation. The metric enables robots to prioritize information transmissions within bandwidth constraints. We also propose the estimation of LoIU using belief distributions and accordingly optimize both transmission schedule and resource allocation strategy for device-to-device transmissions to minimize the time-average LoIU within a robot team. A semi-decentralized Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient framework is developed, where each robot functions as an actor responsible for scheduling transmissions among its collaborators while a central critic periodically evaluates and refines the actors in response to mobility and interference. Simulations validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating an enhancement of information freshness and utility by 98%, compared to alternative methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pose State Perception of Interventional Robot for Cardio-cerebrovascular Procedures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14201v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In response to the increasing demand for cardiocerebrovascular interventional surgeries, precise control of interventional robots has become increasingly important. Within these complex vascular scenarios, the accurate and reliable perception of the pose state for interventional robots is particularly crucial. This paper presents a novel vision-based approach without the need of additional sensors or markers. The core of this paper's method consists of a three-part framework: firstly, a dual-head multitask U-Net model for simultaneous vessel segment and interventional robot detection; secondly, an advanced algorithm for skeleton extraction and optimization; and finally, a comprehensive pose state perception system based on geometric features is implemented to accurately identify the robot's pose state and provide strategies for subsequent control. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed method's high reliability and accuracy in trajectory tracking and pose state perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[AMPLIFY: Actionless Motion Priors for Robot Learning from Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14198v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action-labeled data for robotics is scarce and expensive, limiting the generalization of learned policies. In contrast, vast amounts of action-free video data are readily available, but translating these observations into effective policies remains a challenge. We introduce AMPLIFY, a novel framework that leverages large-scale video data by encoding visual dynamics into compact, discrete motion tokens derived from keypoint trajectories. Our modular approach separates visual motion prediction from action inference, decoupling the challenges of learning what motion defines a task from how robots can perform it. We train a forward dynamics model on abundant action-free videos and an inverse dynamics model on a limited set of action-labeled examples, allowing for independent scaling. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the learned dynamics are both accurate, achieving up to 3.7x better MSE and over 2.5x better pixel prediction accuracy compared to prior approaches, and broadly useful. In downstream policy learning, our dynamics predictions enable a 1.2-2.2x improvement in low-data regimes, a 1.4x average improvement by learning from action-free human videos, and the first generalization to LIBERO tasks from zero in-distribution action data. Beyond robotic control, we find the dynamics learned by AMPLIFY to be a versatile latent world model, enhancing video prediction quality. Our results present a novel paradigm leveraging heterogeneous data sources to build efficient, generalizable world models.

| **[TACS-Graphs: Traversability-Aware Consistent Scene Graphs for Ground Robot Indoor Localization and Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14178v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool for robots, providing a structured representation of spatial and semantic relationships for advanced task planning. Despite their potential, conventional 3D indoor scene graphs face critical limitations, particularly under- and over-segmentation of room layers in structurally complex environments. Under-segmentation misclassifies non-traversable areas as part of a room, often in open spaces, while over-segmentation fragments a single room into overlapping segments in complex environments. These issues stem from naive voxel-based map representations that rely solely on geometric proximity, disregarding the structural constraints of traversable spaces and resulting in inconsistent room layers within scene graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to tackle segmentation inconsistency as a challenge and address it with Traversability-Aware Consistent Scene Graphs (TACS-Graphs), a novel framework that integrates ground robot traversability with room segmentation. By leveraging traversability as a key factor in defining room boundaries, the proposed method achieves a more semantically meaningful and topologically coherent segmentation, effectively mitigating the inaccuracies of voxel-based scene graph approaches in complex environments. Furthermore, the enhanced segmentation consistency improves loop closure detection efficiency in the proposed Consistent Scene Graph-leveraging Loop Closure Detection (CoSG-LCD) leading to higher pose estimation accuracy. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of scene graph consistency and pose graph optimization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[GAF: Gaussian Action Field as a Dvnamic World Model for Robotic Mlanipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14135v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate action inference is critical for vision-based robotic manipulation. Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we propose a V-4D-A framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing simultaneous modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF supports three key query types: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of initial action via robot motion. Furthermore, the high-quality current and future frames generated by GAF facilitate manipulation action refinement through a GAF-guided diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average success rate in robotic manipulation tasks by 10.33% over state-of-the-art methods.

Traditional methods, such as passwords and static biometrics, are vulnerable to spoofing and replay attacks, particularly in high-stakes, continuous interactions. This paper presents a novel anti-spoofing and anti-replay authentication approach that leverages distinctive user behavioral features extracted from haptic feedback during human-robot interactions. To evaluate our authentication approach, we collected a time-series force feedback dataset from 15 participants performing seven distinct tasks. We then developed a transformer-based deep learning model to extract temporal features from the haptic signals. By analyzing user-specific force dynamics, our method achieves over 90 percent accuracy in both user identification and task classification, demonstrating its potential for enhancing access control and identity assurance in tele-robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Point Cloud Completion Approach for the Grasping of Partially Occluded Objects and Its Applications in Robotic Strawberry Harvesting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14066v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robotic fruit picking applications, managing object occlusion in unstructured settings poses a substantial challenge for designing grasping algorithms. Using strawberry harvesting as a case study, we present an end-to-end framework for effective object detection, segmentation, and grasp planning to tackle this issue caused by partially occluded objects. Our strategy begins with point cloud denoising and segmentation to accurately locate fruits. To compensate for incomplete scans due to occlusion, we apply a point cloud completion model to create a dense 3D reconstruction of the strawberries. The target selection focuses on ripe strawberries while categorizing others as obstacles, followed by converting the refined point cloud into an occupancy map for collision-aware motion planning. Our experimental results demonstrate high shape reconstruction accuracy, with the lowest Chamfer Distance compared to state-of-the-art methods with 1.10 mm, and significantly improved grasp success rates of 79.17%, yielding an overall success-to-attempt ratio of 89.58\% in real-world strawberry harvesting. Additionally, our method reduces the obstacle hit rate from 43.33% to 13.95%, highlighting its effectiveness in improving both grasp quality and safety compared to prior approaches. This pipeline substantially improves autonomous strawberry harvesting, advancing more efficient and reliable robotic fruit picking systems.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by these natural phenomena, we present a novel acoustic robotic system for the transport of contactless objects in mid-air. Our system leverages phased ultrasonic transducers and a robotic control system onboard to generate localized acoustic pressure fields, enabling precise manipulation of airborne particles and robots. We categorize contactless object-transport strategies into independent transport (uncoordinated) and forward-facing cooperative transport (coordinated), drawing parallels with biological systems to optimize efficiency and robustness. The proposed system is experimentally validated by evaluating levitation stability using a microphone in the measurement lab, transport efficiency through a phase-space motion capture system, and clock synchronization accuracy via an oscilloscope. The results demonstrate the feasibility of both independent and cooperative airborne object transport. This research contributes to the field of acoustophoretic robotics, with potential applications in contactless material handling, micro-assembly, and biomedical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025) as oral presentation, 8 pages with 8 figures</p></details> |

This process is defined as a multimodal classification task. However, gathering a large-scale dataset encompassing both visual and linguistic elements for model training is challenging and time-consuming. To address this issue, our paper introduces a novel framework focusing on data augmentation in robotic assistance scenarios, encompassing both dialogues and related environmental imagery. This approach involves leveraging a sophisticated large language model to simulate potential conversations and environmental contexts, followed by the use of a stable diffusion model to create images depicting these environments. The additionally generated data serves to refine the latest multimodal models, enabling them to more accurately determine appropriate actions in response to user interactions with the limited target data. Our experimental results, based on a dataset collected from real-world scenarios, demonstrate that our methodology significantly enhances the robot's action selection capabilities, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>IWSDS...</summary><p>IWSDS 2024 Best Paper Award</p></details> |

Despite recent advances in training general-purpose robot manipulation policies guided by language instructions, there is a notable lack of large-scale datasets for fine-grained manipulation tasks with part-level instructions and diverse 3D object instances annotated with part-level labels. In this work, we introduce PartInstruct, the first large-scale benchmark for training and evaluating fine-grained robot manipulation models using part-level instructions. PartInstruct comprises 513 object instances across 14 categories, each annotated with part-level information, and 1302 fine-grained manipulation tasks organized into 16 task classes. Our training set consists of over 10,000 expert demonstrations synthesized in a 3D simulator, where each demonstration is paired with a high-level task instruction, a chain of base part-based skill instructions, and ground-truth 3D information about the object and its parts. Additionally, we designed a comprehensive test suite to evaluate the generalizability of learned policies across new states, objects, and tasks. We evaluated several state-of-the-art robot manipulation approaches, including end-to-end vision-language policy learning and bi-level planning models for robot manipulation on our benchmark. The experimental results reveal that current models struggle to robustly ground part concepts and predict actions in 3D space, and face challenges when manipulating object parts in long-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |

A critical aspect in this context is the concept of personal space, a psychological boundary around an individual that influences their comfort based on proximity. This concept extends to human-robot interaction, where robots must respect personal space to avoid causing discomfort. While much research has focused on modeling personal space in two dimensions, almost none have considered the vertical dimension. In this work, we propose a novel three-dimensional personal space model that integrates both height (introducing a discomfort function along the Z-axis) and horizontal proximity (via a classic XY-plane formulation) to quantify discomfort. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to compute discomfort in 3D space at any robot component's position, considering the person's configuration and height.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2025 34th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (ROMAN)</p></details> |

Drawing on a range of empirical studies and practical deployments, this paper outlines six key insights that highlight both the opportunities and challenges in using robots to promote mental wellbeing. These include (1) the lack of a single, objective measure of wellbeing, (2) the fact that robots don't need to act as companions to be effective, (3) the growing potential of virtual interactions, (4) the importance of involving clinicians in the design process, (5) the difference between one-off and long-term interactions, and (6) the idea that adaptation and personalization are not always necessary for positive outcomes. Rather than positioning robots as replacements for human therapists, we argue that they are best understood as supportive tools that must be designed with care, grounded in evidence, and shaped by ethical and psychological considerations. Our aim is to inform future research and guide responsible, effective use of robots in mental health and wellbeing contexts.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in haptic-guided teleoperation have shown promise, they are often limited to simplified tasks involving 6- or 7-DoF manipulators and rely on separate control strategies for navigation and manipulation. This increases both cognitive load and operational overhead. In this paper, we present a unified tele-mobile manipulation framework that leverages haptic-guided shared control. The system integrates a 9-DoF follower mobile manipulator and a 7-DoF leader robotic arm, enabling seamless transitions between tele-navigation and tele-manipulation through real-time haptic feedback. A user study with 20 participants under real-world conditions demonstrates that our framework significantly improves task accuracy and efficiency without increasing cognitive load. These findings highlight the potential of haptic-guided shared control for enhancing operator performance in demanding teleoperation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE CASE 2025</p></details> |

A fundamental challenge in developing such models is effectively aligning the vision-language space with the robotic action space. Existing approaches typically rely on directly fine-tuning VLMs using expert demonstrations. However, this strategy suffers from a spatio-temporal gap, resulting in considerable data inefficiency and heavy reliance on human labor. Spatially, VLMs operate within a high-level semantic space, whereas robotic actions are grounded in low-level 3D physical space; temporally, VLMs primarily interpret the present, while VLA models anticipate future actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel training paradigm, ROSA, which leverages robot state estimation to improve alignment between vision-language and action spaces. By integrating robot state estimation data obtained via an automated process, ROSA enables the VLA model to gain enhanced spatial understanding and self-awareness, thereby boosting performance and generalization. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of ROSA, particularly in low-data regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pursuit-Evasion for Car-like Robots with Sensor Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05372v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a pursuit-evasion game between two players with car-like dynamics and sensing limitations by formalizing it as a partially observable stochastic zero-sum game. The partial observability caused by the sensing constraints is particularly challenging. As an example, in a situation where the agents have no visibility of each other, they would need to extract information from their sensor coverage history to reason about potential locations of their opponents. However, keeping historical information greatly increases the size of the state space. To mitigate the challenges encountered with such partially observable problems, we develop a new learning-based method that encodes historical information to a belief state and uses it to generate agent actions. Through experiments we show that the learned strategies improve over existing multi-agent RL baselines by up to 16 % in terms of capture rate for the pursuer. Additionally, we present experimental results showing that learned belief states are strong state estimators for extending existing game theory solvers and demonstrate our method's competitiveness for problems where existing fully observable game theory solvers are computationally feasible. Finally, we deploy the learned policies on physical robots for a game between the F1TENTH and JetRacer platforms moving as fast as $\textbf{2 m/s}$ in indoor environments, showing that they can be executed on real-robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025) as oral presentation</p></details> |
| **[What Matters in Learning from Large-Scale Datasets for Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13536v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning from large multi-task demonstration datasets has emerged as a promising path for building generally-capable robots. As a result, 1000s of hours have been spent on building such large-scale datasets around the globe. Despite the continuous growth of such efforts, we still lack a systematic understanding of what data should be collected to improve the utility of a robotics dataset and facilitate downstream policy learning. In this work, we conduct a large-scale dataset composition study to answer this question. We develop a data generation framework to procedurally emulate common sources of diversity in existing datasets (such as sensor placements and object types and arrangements), and use it to generate large-scale robot datasets with controlled compositions, enabling a suite of dataset composition studies that would be prohibitively expensive in the real world. We focus on two practical settings: (1) what types of diversity should be emphasized when future researchers collect large-scale datasets for robotics, and (2) how should current practitioners retrieve relevant demonstrations from existing datasets to maximize downstream policy performance on tasks of interest. Our study yields several critical insights -- for example, we find that camera poses and spatial arrangements are crucial dimensions for both diversity in collection and alignment in retrieval. In real-world robot learning settings, we find that not only do our insights from simulation carry over, but our retrieval strategies on existing datasets such as DROID allow us to consistently outperform existing training strategies by up to 70%.

It involves a large number of autonomous robots of heterogeneous behavior, coordination among them, and their interaction with the dynamic environment. This process of complex structure formation is considered a complex system, which needs to be modeled by using any modeling approach. Although the formal specification approach along with other formal methods has been used to model the behavior of robots in a swarm. However, to the best of our knowledge, the formal specification approach has not been used to model the self-organization process in swarm robotic systems for shape formation. In this paper, we use a formal specification approach to model the shape formation task of swarm robots. We use Z (Zed) language of formal specification, which is a state-based language, to model the states of the entities of the systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Z for the self-organized shape formation. The presented formal specification model gives the outlines for designing and implementing the swarm robotic system for the formation of complex shapes and structures. It also provides the foundation for modeling the complex shape formation process for swarm robotics using a multi-agent system in a simulation-based environment.

However, there are several settings, such as construction or warehouse automation, where a robot needs to interact with a structured object formation such as a stack. In this context, we define the problem of selecting suitable objects for grasping along with estimating an accurate 6DoF pose of these objects. To address this problem, we propose a camera-IMU based approach that prioritizes unobstructed objects on the higher layers of stacks and introduce a dataset for benchmarking and evaluation, along with a suitable evaluation metric that combines object selection with pose accuracy. Experimental results show that although our method can perform quite well, this is a challenging problem if a completely error-free solution is needed. Finally, we show results from the deployment of our method for a brick-picking application in a construction scenario.</p></details> |  |

However, existing calibration methods typically require complex and often human-operated processes to collect data. Moreover, most frameworks neglect acoustic sensors, thereby limiting the associated systems' auditory perception capabilities. To alleviate these issues, we propose an observability-aware active calibration method for ground robots with multimodal sensors, including a microphone array, a LiDAR (exteroceptive sensors), and wheel encoders (proprioceptive sensors). Unlike traditional approaches, our method enables active trajectory optimization for online data collection and calibration, contributing to the development of more intelligent robotic systems. Specifically, we leverage the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to quantify parameter observability and adopt its minimum eigenvalue as an optimization metric for trajectory generation via B-spline curves. Through planning and replanning of robot trajectory online, the method enhances the observability of multi-sensor extrinsic parameters. The effectiveness and advantages of our method have been demonstrated through numerical simulations and real-world experiments.

Although this approach brings high degrees of modularity, it also yields uncertainty, with regard to providing cybersecurity assurances and guarantees on the integrity of the embodiment. In this paper, first we illustrate how cyberattacks on different devices can have radically different consequences on the robot's ability to complete its tasks and preserve its embodiment. We also claim that modern robots should have self-awareness for what concerns such aspects, and formulate in two propositions the different characteristics that robots should integrate for doing so. Then, we show how these propositions relate to two established cybersecurity frameworks, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the MITRE ATT&CK, and we argue that achieving these propositions requires that robots possess at least three properties for mapping devices and tasks. Last, we reflect on how these three properties could be achieved in a larger conceptual framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Particularly, we design a potential gradient in the form of a cubic polynomial for the passenger's controller as a function of the carrier-passenger and carrier-target distances in the moving carrier's frame. This introduces multiple equilibrium points corresponding to the zero state of the error dynamic system during carrier-passenger separation. The change of equilibrium points is associated with the change in their attraction regions, enabling smooth carrier-passenger separation and afterwards seamless navigation toward the target. Finally, simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed controller in environments containing obstacles.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces and evaluates a novel multimodal AR-based robot puppeteer framework that enables intuitive teleoperation via virtual counterpart through large language model (LLM)-driven voice commands and hand gesture interactions. Utilizing the Meta Quest 3, users interact with a virtual counterpart robot in real-time, effectively "puppeteering" its physical counterpart within an AR environment. We conducted a within-subject user study with 42 participants performing robotic cube pick-and-place with pattern matching tasks under two conditions: gesture-only interaction and combined voice-and-gesture interaction. Both objective performance metrics and subjective user experience (UX) measures were assessed, including an extended comparative analysis between roboticists and non-roboticists. The results provide key insights into how multimodal input influences contextual task efficiency, usability, and user satisfaction in AR-based HRI.

This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision Language Model (VLM). The LLM decomposes tasks and constructs a global semantic map, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this framework, the aerial robot follows an optimized global semantic path and continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on real-world cube or object arrangement tasks demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.</p></details> |  |

For instance, during mouse skull drilling, the appearance alters little when thinning bone tissue because of its semi-transparent property and the high-magnification microscopic vision. To obtain the object's state, we introduce an object state estimation method for biological specimens through active interaction based on the deflection. The method is integrated to enhance the autonomous drilling system developed in our previous work. The method and integrated system were evaluated through 12 autonomous eggshell drilling experiment trials. The results show that the system achieved a 91.7% successful ratio and 75% detachable ratio, showcasing its potential applicability in more complex surgical procedures such as mouse skull craniotomy. This research paves the way for further development of autonomous robotic systems capable of estimating the object's state through active interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first and second authors contribute equally to this research. 6 pages, 5 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

While existing frameworks excel in training single motion-specific policies, they struggle to generalize across highly varied behaviors due to conflicting control requirements and mismatched data distributions. In this work, we propose BumbleBee (BB), an expert-generalist learning framework that combines motion clustering and sim-to-real adaptation to overcome these challenges. BB first leverages an autoencoder-based clustering method to group behaviorally similar motions using motion features and motion descriptions. Expert policies are then trained within each cluster and refined with real-world data through iterative delta action modeling to bridge the sim-to-real gap. Finally, these experts are distilled into a unified generalist controller that preserves agility and robustness across all motion types. Experiments on two simulations and a real humanoid robot demonstrate that BB achieves state-of-the-art general whole-body control, setting a new benchmark for agile, robust, and generalizable humanoid performance in the real world.</p></details> |  |

In general, we must construct such a 3D interpretation of a complex scene based on limited input, such as a single RGB-D image. We describe SceneComplete, a system for constructing a complete, segmented, 3D model of a scene from a single view. SceneComplete is a novel pipeline for composing general-purpose pretrained perception modules (vision-language, segmentation, image-inpainting, image-to-3D, visual-descriptors and pose-estimation) to obtain highly accurate results. We demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness with respect to ground-truth models in a large benchmark dataset and show that its accurate whole-object reconstruction enables robust grasp proposal generation, including for a dexterous hand. We release the code on our website https://scenecomplete.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Techniques such as Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) have been introduced to improve learning efficiency for such tasks. More recently, researchers have combined HER with advanced imitation learning methods such as Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to integrate demonstration data and accelerate training speed. However, demonstration data often fails to provide enough coverage for the goal space, especially when acquired from human teleoperation. This biases the learning-from-demonstration process toward mastering easier sub-tasks instead of tackling the more challenging ones. In this work, we present Goal-based Self-Adaptive Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (Goal-SAGAIL), a novel framework specifically designed for multi-goal robot manipulation tasks. By integrating self-adaptive learning principles with goal-conditioned GAIL, our approach enhances imitation learning efficiency, even when limited, suboptimal demonstrations are available. Experimental results validate that our method significantly improves learning efficiency across various multi-goal manipulation scenarios -- including complex in-hand manipulation tasks -- using suboptimal demonstrations provided by both simulation and human experts.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

We present a spatial-relationship-aware dataset of nearly 1,000 robot-acquired indoor images, annotated with object attributes, positions, and detailed spatial relationships. Captured using a Boston Dynamics Spot robot and labelled with a custom annotation tool, the dataset reflects complex scenarios with similar or identical objects and intricate spatial arrangements. We benchmark six state-of-the-art scene-graph generation models on this dataset, analysing their inference speed and relational accuracy. Our results highlight significant differences in model performance and demonstrate that integrating explicit spatial relationships into foundation models, such as ChatGPT 4o, substantially improves their ability to generate executable, spatially-aware plans for robotics.

The robot argued for the correct answer on six questions and the wrong on two, and 75% of the students were persuaded by the robot to perform beyond their expected capacity, positively when the robot was correct and negatively when it was wrong. Students with more experience of using large language models were even more likely to be influenced by the robot's stance -- in particular for the two easiest questions on which the robot was wrong -- suggesting that familiarity with AI can increase susceptibility to misinformation by AI. We further examined how three different levels of portrayed robot certainty, displayed using semantics, prosody and facial signals, affected how the students aligned with the robot's answer on specific questions and how convincing they perceived the robot to be on these questions. The students aligned with the robot's answers in 94.4% of the cases when the robot was portrayed as Certain, 82.6% when it was Neutral and 71.4% when it was Uncertain. The alignment was thus high for all conditions, highlighting students' general susceptibility to accept the robot's stance, but alignment in the Uncertain condition was significantly lower than in the Certain. Post-test questionnaire answers further show that students found the robot most convincing when it was portrayed as Certain. These findings highlight the need for educational robots to adjust their display of certainty based on the reliability of the information they convey, to promote students' critical thinking and reduce undue influence.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages; 8 figures; 3 tables; RSS 2025 (Robotics: Science & Systems)</p></details> |

We introduce DinoCompanion, the first attachment-theory-grounded multimodal robot for emotionally responsive child-AI interaction. We address three critical challenges in child-AI systems: the absence of developmentally-informed AI architectures, the need to balance engagement with safety, and the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks for attachment-based capabilities. Our contributions include: (i) a multimodal dataset of 128 caregiver-child dyads containing 125,382 annotated clips with paired preference-risk labels, (ii) CARPO (Child-Aware Risk-calibrated Preference Optimization), a novel training objective that maximizes engagement while applying epistemic-uncertainty-weighted risk penalties, and (iii) AttachSecure-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering ten attachment-centric competencies with strong expert consensus (\k{appa}=0.81). DinoCompanion achieves state-of-the-art performance (57.15%), outperforming GPT-4o (50.29%) and Claude-3.7-Sonnet (53.43%), with exceptional secure base behaviors (72.99%, approaching human expert levels of 78.4%) and superior attachment risk detection (69.73%). Ablations validate the critical importance of multimodal fusion, uncertainty-aware risk modeling, and hierarchical memory for coherent, emotionally attuned interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches often project them into compressed intermediate representations, discarding important task-specific information such as fine-grained spatial or semantic details. To address this, we propose AntiGrounding, a new framework that reverses the instruction grounding process. It lifts candidate actions directly into the VLM representation space, renders trajectories from multiple views, and uses structured visual question answering for instruction-based decision making. This enables zero-shot synthesis of optimal closed-loop robot trajectories for new tasks. We also propose an offline policy refinement module that leverages past experience to enhance long-term performance. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that our method outperforms baselines across diverse robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Explosive Output to Enhance Jumping Ability: A Variable Reduction Ratio Design Paradigm for Humanoid Robots Knee Joint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12314v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the explosive power output of the knee joints is critical for improving the agility and obstacle-crossing capabilities of humanoid robots. However, a mismatch between the knee-to-center-of-mass (CoM) transmission ratio and jumping demands, coupled with motor performance degradation at high speeds, restricts the duration of high-power output and limits jump performance. To address these problems, this paper introduces a novel knee joint design paradigm employing a dynamically decreasing reduction ratio for explosive output during jump. Analysis of motor output characteristics and knee kinematics during jumping inspired a coupling strategy in which the reduction ratio gradually decreases as the joint extends. A high initial ratio rapidly increases torque at jump initiation, while its gradual reduction minimizes motor speed increments and power losses, thereby maintaining sustained high-power output. A compact and efficient linear actuator-driven guide-rod mechanism realizes this coupling strategy, supported by parameter optimization guided by explosive jump control strategies. Experimental validation demonstrated a 63 cm vertical jump on a single-joint platform (a theoretical improvement of 28.1\% over the optimal fixed-ratio joints). Integrated into a humanoid robot, the proposed design enabled a 1.1 m long jump, a 0.5 m vertical jump, and a 0.5 m box jump.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProVox: Personalization and Proactive Planning for Situated Human-Robot Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12248v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative robots must quickly adapt to their partner's intent and preferences to proactively identify helpful actions. This is especially true in situated settings where human partners can continually teach robots new high-level behaviors, visual concepts, and physical skills (e.g., through demonstration), growing the robot's capabilities as the human-robot pair work together to accomplish diverse tasks. In this work, we argue that robots should be able to infer their partner's goals from early interactions and use this information to proactively plan behaviors ahead of explicit instructions from the user. Building from the strong commonsense priors and steerability of large language models, we introduce ProVox ("Proactive Voice"), a novel framework that enables robots to efficiently personalize and adapt to individual collaborators. We design a meta-prompting protocol that empowers users to communicate their distinct preferences, intent, and expected robot behaviors ahead of starting a physical interaction. ProVox then uses the personalized prompt to condition a proactive language model task planner that anticipates a user's intent from the current interaction context and robot capabilities to suggest helpful actions; in doing so, we alleviate user burden, minimizing the amount of time partners spend explicitly instructing and supervising the robot. We evaluate ProVox through user studies grounded in household manipulation tasks (e.g., assembling lunch bags) that measure the efficiency of the collaboration, as well as features such as perceived helpfulness, ease of use, and reliability. Our analysis suggests that both meta-prompting and proactivity are critical, resulting in 38.7% faster task completion times and 31.9% less user burden relative to non-active baselines.

Our system features a newly designed 16-DoF tendon-driven hand, equipped with wide angle wrist cameras and mounted on a Franka Emika Panda arm. We develop a versatile teleoperation pipeline and data collection protocol using both glove-based and VR interfaces, enabling high-quality data collection across diverse tasks such as pick and place, item sorting and assembly insertion. Leveraging high-frequency generative control, we train end-to-end policies from raw sensory inputs, enabling smooth, self-correcting motions in complex manipulation scenarios. Real-world evaluations demonstrate up to 93.3% out of distribution success rates, with up to a +33.3% performance boost due to emergent self-correcting behaviors, while also revealing scaling trends in policy performance. Our results advance the state-of-the-art in dexterous robotic manipulation through a fully integrated, practical approach to hardware, learning, and real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

First, a fiber-reinforced bending module with a strain-limiting layer made of polypropylene was fabricated. The SMA wire was then placed in a silicon matrix, which was used as a new strain-limiting layer. A simple closed-loop control algorithm was used to regulate the bending angle of the soft robot within its workspace. A camera was utilized to measure the angular changes in the vertical plane. Different angles, ranging from 0 to 65 degrees, were covered to evaluate the performance of the module and the bending angle control algorithm. The experimental tests demonstrate that using the SMA wire results in more precise control of bending in the vertical plane. In addition, it is possible to bend more with less working pressure. The error range was reduced from an average of 5 degrees to 2 degrees, and the rise time was reduced from an average of 19 seconds to 3 seconds.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we firstly introduce an improved hardware design of the SLIDER bipedal robot with new line-feet and more optimized mass distribution that enables higher locomotion speeds. Secondly, we propose an extended Hybrid Zero Dynamics (eHZD) method, which can be applied to prismatic joint robots like SLIDER. The eHZD method is then used to generate a library of gaits with varying reference velocities in an offline way. Thirdly, a Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed to use the pre-generated library to create walking control policies in real-time. This approach allows us to combine the advantages of both HZD (for generating stable gaits with a full-dynamics model) and DRL (for real-time adaptive gait generation). The experimental results show that this approach achieves 150% higher walking velocity than the previous MPC-based approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CLAWAR 2025</p></details> |

The proposed filter is first tested with a benchmark numerical problem to validate the performance with other state-of-the-practice approaches such as Particle Filter (PF) and Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) filters. Then the proposed approach is tested and compared against PF and PGM filters in real-world robotic field experiments to validate its impact for real-world applications. The considered real-world scenarios have partial observability with the range-only measurement and uncertainty with the measurement model. The results show that the proposed filter can handle this partial observability effectively whilst showing improved performance compared to PF, reducing the computation requirements while demonstrating improved robustness over compared techniques.</p></details> |  |

Simultaneously, the linear economy considers end-of-use products as waste rather than as a resource, which results in large volumes of waste whose management remains an unsolved problem. Since a transition to a circular economy can mitigate these open issues, in this paper we begin by enhancing the notion of circularity based on compartmental dynamical thermodynamics, namely, $\lambda$, and then, we model a thermodynamical material network processing a batch of 2 solid materials of criticality coefficients of 0.1 and 0.95, with a robotic disassembler compartment controlled via reinforcement learning (RL), and processing 2-7 kg of materials. Subsequently, we focused on the design of the robotic disassembler compartment using state-of-the-art RL algorithms and assessing the algorithm performance with respect to $\lambda$ (Fig. 1). The highest circularity is -2.1 achieved in the case of disassembling 2 parts of 1 kg each, whereas it reduces to -7.2 in the case of disassembling 4 parts of 1 kg each contained inside a chassis of 3 kg. Finally, a sensitivity analysis highlighted that the impact on $\lambda$ of the performance of an RL controller has a positive correlation with the quantity and the criticality of the materials to be disassembled. This work also gives the principles of the emerging research fields indicated as circular intelligence and robotics (CIRO). Source code is publicly available.</p></details> | To be submitted |
| **[Dynamic Collaborative Material Distribution System for Intelligent Robots In Smart Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11723v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The collaboration and interaction of multiple robots have become integral aspects of smart manufacturing. Effective planning and management play a crucial role in achieving energy savings and minimising overall costs. This paper addresses the real-time Dynamic Multiple Sources to Single Destination (DMS-SD) navigation problem, particularly with a material distribution case for multiple intelligent robots in smart manufacturing. Enumerated solutions, such as in \cite{xiao2022efficient}, tackle the problem by generating as many optimal or near-optimal solutions as possible but do not learn patterns from the previous experience, whereas the method in \cite{xiao2023collaborative} only uses limited information from the earlier trajectories. Consequently, these methods may take a considerable amount of time to compute results on large maps, rendering real-time operations impractical. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to address the DMS-SD problem. The proposed DRL method can be efficiently trained and rapidly converges to the optimal solution using the designed target-guided reward function. A well-trained DRL model significantly reduces the computation time for the next movement to a millisecond level, which improves the time up to 100 times in our experiments compared to the enumerated solutions. Moreover, the trained DRL model can be easily deployed on lightweight devices in smart manufacturing, such as Internet of Things devices and mobile phones, which only require limited computational resources.</p></details> |  |

It integrates features such as runtime introspection, asynchronous feedback, multi-tenant namespace isolation, and strict type validation to ensure robustness, scalability, and security. The architecture, message structure, interface model, and adapter-based backend integration strategy of RCP are described, along with deployment practices and applicability across industries including manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare.

A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and adaptability across diverse environments.

But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform machines, especially in micro scale manufacturing, which requires high-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for high levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment. Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although advanced metrology sensors and high precision microprocessors, which are utilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic errors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that simulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications can reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great extent. In addition, most research papers in visual servoing mainly focus on developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few have discussed the importance of the camera's location in the configuration. In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image shot at different locations. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose a novel algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches for the optimal location where the image noise level is minimized.</p></details> | <details><summary>272 p...</summary><p>272 pages, 171 figures, PhD dissertation, University of California, Davis, 2025.

We propose a concept that enables the automation of experiments by utilizing dual demonstrations of robot motions and jig operations by chemists in an experimental environment constructed to be controlled by a robot. To verify this concept, we developed a chemical-experiment-automation system consisting of jigs to assist the robot in experiments, a motion-demonstration interface, a jig-control interface, and a mobile manipulator. We validate the concept through polymer-synthesis experiments, focusing on critical liquid-handling tasks such as pipetting and dilution. The experimental results indicate high reproducibility of the demonstrated motions and robust task-success rates. This comprehensive concept not only simplifies the robot programming process for chemists but also provides a flexible and efficient solution to accommodate a wide range of experimental conditions, contributing significantly to the field of chemical experiment automation.</p></details> |  |

To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution. While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning, multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements, rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |

We devise a hybrid approach using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) as the latent space priors for a Variational Autoencoder to model a joint distribution over the interacting agents. We leverage the interaction dynamics learned from HHI to learn HRI and incorporate the conditional generation of robot motions from human observations into the training, thereby predicting more accurate robot trajectories. The generated robot motions are further adapted with Inverse Kinematics to ensure the desired physical proximity with a human, combining the ease of joint space learning and accurate task space reachability. For contact-rich interactions, we modulate the robot's stiffness using HMM segmentation for a compliant interaction. We verify the effectiveness of our approach deployed on a Humanoid robot via a user study. Our method generalizes well to various humans despite being trained on data from just two humans. We find that users perceive our method as more human-like, timely, and accurate and rank our method with a higher degree of preference over other baselines.

Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a 360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.

| **[Passivity-Centric Safe Reinforcement Learning for Contact-Rich Robotic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00287v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in various robotic tasks; however, its deployment in real-world scenarios, particularly in contact-rich environments, often overlooks critical safety and stability aspects. Policies without passivity guarantees can result in system instability, posing risks to robots, their environments, and human operators. In this work, we investigate the limitations of traditional RL policies when deployed in contact-rich tasks and explore the combination of energy-based passive control with safe RL in both training and deployment to answer these challenges. Firstly, we reveal the discovery that standard RL policy does not satisfy stability in contact-rich scenarios. Secondly, we introduce a \textit{passivity-aware} RL policy training with energy-based constraints in our safe RL formulation. Lastly, a passivity filter is exerted on the policy output for \textit{passivity-ensured} control during deployment. We conduct comparative studies on a contact-rich robotic maze exploration task, evaluating the effects of learning passivity-aware policies and the importance of passivity-ensured control. The experiments demonstrate that a passivity-agnostic RL policy easily violates energy constraints in deployment, even though it achieves high task completion in training. The results show that our proposed approach guarantees control stability through passivity filtering and improves the energy efficiency through passivity-aware training. A video of real-world experiments is available as supplementary material. We also release the checkpoint model and offline data for pre-training at \href{https://huggingface.co/Anonymous998/passiveRL/tree/main}{Hugging Face}.</p></details> | revision version |

In the context of robot-assisted delivery, we investigate how robot performance and trust repair strategies impact human trust. In this task, while handling a secondary task, humans can choose to either send the robot to deliver autonomously or manually control it. The trust repair strategies examined include short and long explanations, apology and promise, and denial. Using data from human participants, we model human behavior using an Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) to capture the dynamics of trust and human action probabilities. Our findings indicate that humans are more likely to deploy the robot autonomously when their trust is high. Furthermore, state transition estimates show that long explanations are the most effective at repairing trust following a failure, while denial is most effective at preventing trust loss. We also demonstrate that the trust estimates generated by our model are isomorphic to self-reported trust values, making them interpretable. This model lays the groundwork for developing optimal policies that facilitate real-time adjustment of human trust in autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Prediction of Dynamic Interactions Between Robot Appendage and Granular Material](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10875v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input, the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline phases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Robot Navigation using Event-based Cameras and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10790v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event cameras and other sensors with reinforcement learning to enable real-time human-centered navigation and obstacle avoidance. Unlike conventional image-based controllers, which operate at fixed rates and suffer from motion blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated environments, demonstrating robust navigation, pedestrian following, and obstacle avoidance.

| **[APEX: Action Priors Enable Efficient Exploration for Skill Imitation on Articulated Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10022v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning by imitation provides an effective way for robots to develop well-regulated complex behaviors and directly benefit from natural demonstrations. State-of-the-art imitation learning (IL) approaches typically leverage Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP), which, despite their impressive results, suffer from two key limitations. They are prone to mode collapse, which often leads to overfitting to the simulation environment and thus increased sim-to-real gap, and they struggle to learn diverse behaviors effectively. To overcome these limitations, we introduce APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient eXploration): a simple yet versatile IL framework that integrates demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL), maintaining high exploration while grounding behavior with expert-informed priors. We achieve this through a combination of decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is complemented by a multi-critic RL framework that effectively balances stylistic consistency with task performance. Our approach achieves sample-efficient IL and enables the acquisition of diverse skills within a single policy. APEX generalizes to varying velocities and preserves reference-like styles across complex tasks such as navigating rough terrain and climbing stairs, utilizing only flat-terrain kinematic motion data as a prior. We validate our framework through extensive hardware experiments on the Unitree Go2 quadruped. There, APEX yields diverse and agile locomotion gaits, inherent gait transitions, and the highest reported speed for the platform to the best of our knowledge (peak velocity of ~3.3 m/s on hardware). Our results establish APEX as a compelling alternative to existing IL methods, offering better efficiency, adaptability, and real-world performance. https://marmotlab.github.io/APEX/</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic deployment, their dependence on expert demonstrations hinders the crucial capabilities of correction and learning from failures. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization method named HAPO, designed to correct deployment failures and foster effective adaptation through preference alignment for VLA models. This method begins with a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. These human-intervention trajectories are further employed within the action preference optimization process, facilitating VLA models to mitigate failure action occurrences while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Specifically, we propose an adaptive reweighting algorithm to address the issues of irreversible interactions and token probability mismatch when introducing preference optimization into VLA models, facilitating model learning from binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Through combining these modules, our human-assisted action preference optimization method ensures reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models. The experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

The numerous applications of agricultural robots rely on the transmission of data via mobile network, with the amount of data depending on the services offered by the robots and the level of on-board technology. Nevertheless, infrastructure required to deploy these robots, as well as the related energy and environmental consequences, appear overlooked in the digital agriculture literature. In this study, we propose a method for assessing the additional energy consumption and carbon footprint induced by a large-scale deployment of agricultural robots. Our method also estimates the share of agricultural area that can be managed by the deployed robots with respect to network infrastructure constraints. We have applied this method to metropolitan France mobile network and agricultural parcels for five different robotic scenarios. Our results show that increasing the robot's bitrate needs leads to significant additional impacts, which increase at a pace that is poorly captured by classical linear extrapolation methods. When constraining the network to the existing sites, increased bitrate needs also comes with a rapidly decreasing manageable agricultural area.</p></details> |  |

However, previous studies have primarily focused on detecting and analyzing objects or robots, with limited attention to ensuring safety, which is critical for clinical applications, where accidents can be caused by unsafe robot motions. In this study, we propose a new control framework that can formally ensure the safety of automating the cutting task in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), a representative endoscopic surgical method for the treatment of early GI cancer, by using an endoscopic robot. The proposed framework utilizes Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to accurately identify the boundaries of individual tumors, even in close proximity within the GI tract, ensuring precise treatment and removal while preserving the surrounding normal tissue. Additionally, by adopting a model-free control scheme, safety assurance is made possible even in endoscopic robotic systems where dynamic modeling is challenging. We demonstrate the proposed framework in a simulation-based experimental environment, where the tumors to be removed are close to each other, and show that the safety constraints are enforced. We show that the model-free CBF-based controlled robot eliminates one tumor completely without damaging it, while not invading another nearby tumor.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

Human teams rely on effective communication for successful collaboration in time-sensitive environments. Robots can play a role in enhancing team coordination through real-time assistance. Despite significant progress in human-robot teaming research, there remains an essential gap in how robots can effectively communicate with action teams using multimodal interaction cues in time-sensitive environments. This study addresses this knowledge gap in an experimental in-lab study to investigate how multimodal robot communication in action teams affects workload and human perception of robots. We explore team collaboration in a medical training scenario where a robotic crash cart (RCC) provides verbal and non-verbal cues to help users remember to perform iterative tasks and search for supplies. Our findings show that verbal cues for object search tasks and visual cues for task reminders reduce team workload and increase perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness more effectively than a robot with no feedback. Our work contributes to multimodal interaction research in the HRI field, highlighting the need for more human-robot teaming research to understand best practices for integrating collaborative robots in time-sensitive environments such as in hospitals, search and rescue, and manufacturing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's original submitted version of the paper accepted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN). \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

However, most research papers focused on developing control solutions when 3D point features can be detected inside the field of view. This work proposes an innovative feedforward-feedback adaptive control algorithm structure with the Youla Parameterization method. A designed feature estimation loop ensures stable and fast motion control when point features are outside the field of view. As 3D point features move inside the field of view, the IBVS feedback loop preserves the precision of the pose at the end of the control period. Also, an adaptive controller is developed in the feedback loop to stabilize the system in the entire range of operations. The nonlinear camera and robot manipulator model is linearized and decoupled online by an adaptive algorithm. The adaptive controller is then computed based on the linearized model evaluated at current linearized point. The proposed solution is robust and easy to implement in different industrial robotic systems. Various scenarios are used in simulations to validate the effectiveness and robust performance of the proposed controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 13 figures.

This pilot study aimed to investigate the potential of humanoid robots to support AO therapy in rehabilitation settings. The brain activity of three healthy right-handed participants was monitored with electroencephalography (EEG) while they observed eight different actions performed by two agents, a human actor and a robot, using their left and right arms. Their event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs, changes in the spectral power of neural oscillations in response to an event or stimulus, compared to baseline) in sensorimotor regions were analyzed. The single-subject analysis showed variability in ERSP patterns among all participants, including power suppression in sensorimotor mu and beta rhythms. One participant showed stronger responses to "robot" AO conditions than to "human" conditions. Strong and positive correlations in ERSP across all conditions were observed for almost all participants and channels, implying common cognitive processes or neural networks at play in the mirror neuron system during AO. The results support the feasibility of using EEG to explore differences in neural responses to observation of robot- and human-induced actions.</p></details> |  |

At key moments during the performance, the audience is invited to either continue the choreography or override it, shaping the unfolding interaction through real-time collective input. While post-performance surveys revealed that participants felt their choices meaningfully influenced the performance, voting data across four public performances exhibited strikingly consistent patterns. This tension between what audience members do, what they feel, and what actually changes highlights a complex interplay between agentive behavior, the experience of agency, and power. We reflect on how choreography, interaction design, and the structure of the performance mediate this relationship, offering a live analogy for algorithmically curated digital systems where agency is felt, but not exercised.</p></details> |  |

Despite progress in solution quality and runtime, its complexity and industrial relevance continue to drive research. This dissertation introduces scalable MRPP methods with provable guarantees and practical heuristics. First, we study dense MRPP on 2D grids, relevant to warehouse and parcel systems. We propose the Rubik Table method, achieving $(1 + \delta)$-optimal makespan (with $\delta \in (0, 0.5]$) for up to $\frac{m_1 m_2}{2}$ robots, solving large instances efficiently and setting a new theoretical benchmark. Next, we address real-world MRPP. We design optimal layouts for structured environments (e.g., warehouses, parking systems) and propose a puzzle-based system for dense, deadlock-free autonomous vehicle parking. We also extend MRPP to Reeds-Shepp robots, introducing motion primitives and smoothing techniques to ensure feasible, efficient paths under nonholonomic constraints. Simulations and real-world tests validate the approach in urban driving and robotic transport scenarios.</p></details> | Ph.D. thesis |

We utilize the clarity feature to measure the distance, present the monocular imaging model, and estimate the position of the target object. We achieve global positioning in our platform by designing a distributed update protocol. The distributed algorithm enables the perception process to simultaneously cover a broader range, and greatly improves the accuracy and robustness of the positioning. Moreover, the explicit dynamics model of the robot in our platform is obtained, based on which, we propose a robust orientation control framework. The control system ensures that the platform maintains a balanced posture for each robot, thereby ensuring the stability of the localization system. The platform can swiftly recover from an forced unstable state to a stable horizontal posture. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments and application scenarios to evaluate the performance of our platform. The proposed new platform may provide support for extensive marine exploration by underwater sensor networks.</p></details> |  |

However, mastering complex manipulation tasks remains an open challenge, constrained by limitations in persistent contextual memory, multi-agent coordination under uncertainty, and dynamic long-horizon planning across variable sequences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{HiBerNAC}, a \textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{B}rain-\textbf{e}mulated \textbf{r}obotic \textbf{N}eural \textbf{A}gent \textbf{C}ollective, inspired by breakthroughs in neuroscience, particularly in neural circuit mechanisms and hierarchical decision-making. Our framework combines: (1) multimodal VLA planning and reasoning with (2) neuro-inspired reflection and multi-agent mechanisms, specifically designed for complex robotic manipulation tasks. By leveraging neuro-inspired functional modules with decentralized multi-agent collaboration, our approach enables robust and enhanced real-time execution of complex manipulation tasks. In addition, the agentic system exhibits scalable collective intelligence via dynamic agent specialization, adapting its coordination strategy to variable task horizons and complexity. Through extensive experiments on complex manipulation tasks compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, we demonstrate that \textbf{HiBerNAC} reduces average long-horizon task completion time by 23\%, and achieves non-zero success rates (12\textendash 31\%) on multi-path tasks where prior state-of-the-art VLA models consistently fail. These results provide indicative evidence for bridging biological cognition and robotic learning mechanisms.</p></details> | 31 pages,5 figures |

While prior research has demonstrated the potential of machine learning (ML) models to increase picking success rates in large-scale robotic fleets by prioritizing high-probability picks and packages, these efforts primarily focused on predicting success probabilities for picks sampled using heuristic methods. Limited attention has been given, however, to leveraging data-driven approaches to directly optimize sampled picks for better performance at scale. In this study, we propose an ML-based framework that predicts transform adjustments as well as improving the selection of suction cups for multi-suction end effectors for sampled picks to enhance their success probabilities. The framework was integrated and evaluated in test workcells that resemble the operations of Amazon Robotics' Robot Induction (Robin) fleet, which is used for package manipulation. Evaluated on over 2 million picks, the proposed method achieves a 20\% reduction in pick failure rates compared to a heuristic-based pick sampling baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness in large-scale warehouse automation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 19th International Symposium on Experimental Robotics (ISER 2025); 6-10 July 2025, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA; 10 pages</p></details> |

Existing approaches mainly leverage latent variable models, e.g., VQ-VAE, to learn skill abstractions through learned vectors (codebooks), while they suffer from codebook collapse and modeling the causal relationship between learned skills. To address these limitations, we present \textbf{S}kill \textbf{T}raining with \textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{R}otation (\textbf{STAR}), a framework that advances both skill learning and composition to complete complex behaviors. Specifically, to prevent codebook collapse, we devise rotation-augmented residual skill quantization (RaRSQ). It encodes relative angles between encoder outputs into the gradient flow by rotation-based gradient mechanism. Points within the same skill code are forced to be either pushed apart or pulled closer together depending on gradient directions. Further, to capture the causal relationship between skills, we present causal skill transformer (CST) which explicitly models dependencies between skill representations through an autoregressive mechanism for coherent action generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of STAR on both LIBERO benchmark and realworld tasks, with around 12\% improvement over the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |

When operating these systems, real-time estimation and control require fast and accurate models. However, prediction with first-principles (FP) models is slow, and learned black-box models have poor generalizability. Physics-informed machine learning offers excellent advantages here, but it is currently limited to simple, often simulated systems without considering changes after training. We propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for articulated soft robots (ASRs) with a focus on data efficiency. The amount of expensive real-world training data is reduced to a minimum -- one dataset in one system domain. Two hours of data in different domains are used for a comparison against two gold-standard approaches: In contrast to a recurrent neural network, the PINN provides a high generalizability. The prediction speed of an accurate FP model is exceeded with the PINN by up to a factor of 467 at slightly reduced accuracy. This enables nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) of a pneumatic ASR. Accurate position tracking with the MPC running at 47 Hz is achieved in six dynamic experiments.</p></details> |  |

Traditional manual techniques, including circular staplers, face challenges such as limited precision, prolonged recovery times, and complications like leaks and tissue misalignment. This paper presents a novel robotic circular stapler designed to enhance the dexterity in confined spaces, improve tissue alignment, and reduce post-operative risks. Integrated with a cognitive robot that serves as a surgeon's assistant, the surgical stapler uses three actuators to perform anvil motion, cutter/stapler motion and allows a 75-degree bending of the cartridge (distal tip). Kinematic analysis is used to compute the stapler tip's position, ensuring synchronization with a robotic system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Unified Diffusion Policy with Action Discrimination for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09422v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many complex scenarios, robotic manipulation relies on generative models to estimate the distribution of multiple successful actions. As the diffusion model has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs well in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However, the diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to iteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic manipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action denoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model training and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions efficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy (TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified denoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in action space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all timesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of policy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose an action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination branch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through action-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern successful actions to better denoising accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RLBench with the highest success rate of 82.6% on a multi-view setup and 83.8% on a single-view setup. In particular, when using fewer denoising iterations, TUDP achieves a more significant improvement in success rate. Additionally, TUDP can produce accurate actions for a wide range of real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Key Objectives in Human-to-Robot Retargeting for Dexterous Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09384v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kinematic retargeting from human hands to robot hands is essential for transferring dexterity from humans to robots in manipulation teleoperation and imitation learning. However, due to mechanical differences between human and robot hands, completely reproducing human motions on robot hands is impossible. Existing works on retargeting incorporate various optimization objectives, focusing on different aspects of hand configuration. However, the lack of experimental comparative studies leaves the significance and effectiveness of these objectives unclear. This work aims to analyze these retargeting objectives for dexterous manipulation through extensive real-world comparative experiments. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive retargeting objective formulation that integrates intuitively crucial factors appearing in recent approaches. The significance of each factor is evaluated through experimental ablation studies on the full objective in kinematic posture retargeting and real-world teleoperated manipulation tasks. Experimental results and conclusions provide valuable insights for designing more accurate and effective retargeting algorithms for real-world dexterous manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Robot: A Brain-Inspired Framework for Vision-Language-Action Models in Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23450v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon robotic manipulation poses significant challenges for autonomous systems, requiring extended reasoning, precise execution, and robust error recovery across complex sequential tasks. Current approaches, whether based on static planning or end-to-end visuomotor policies, suffer from error accumulation and lack effective verification mechanisms during execution, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. We present Agentic Robot, a brain-inspired framework that addresses these limitations through Standardized Action Procedure (SAP)--a novel coordination protocol governing component interactions throughout manipulation tasks. Drawing inspiration from Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) in human organizations, SAP establishes structured workflows for planning, execution, and verification phases. Our architecture comprises three specialized components: (1) a large reasoning model that decomposes high-level instructions into semantically coherent subgoals, (2) a vision-language-action executor that generates continuous control commands from real-time visual inputs, and (3) a temporal verifier that enables autonomous progression and error recovery through introspective assessment. This SAP-driven closed-loop design supports dynamic self-verification without external supervision. On the LIBERO benchmark, Agentic Robot achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average success rate of 79.6%, outperforming SpatialVLA by 6.1% and OpenVLA by 7.4% on long-horizon tasks. These results demonstrate that SAP-driven coordination between specialized components enhances both performance and interpretability in sequential manipulation, suggesting significant potential for reliable autonomous systems.

However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction, visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10 demonstrations.

| **[STREAMS: An Assistive Multimodal AI Framework for Empowering Biosignal Based Robotic Controls](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03486v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-effector based assistive robots face persistent challenges in generating smooth and robust trajectories when controlled by human's noisy and unreliable biosignals such as muscle activities and brainwaves. The produced endpoint trajectories are often jerky and imprecise to perform complex tasks such as stable robotic grasping. We propose STREAMS (Self-Training Robotic End-to-end Adaptive Multimodal Shared autonomy) as a novel framework leveraged deep reinforcement learning to tackle this challenge in biosignal based robotic control systems. STREAMS blends environmental information and synthetic user input into a Deep Q Learning Network (DQN) pipeline for an interactive end-to-end and self-training mechanism to produce smooth trajectories for the control of end-effector based robots. The proposed framework achieved a high-performance record of 98% in simulation with dynamic target estimation and acquisition without any pre-existing datasets. As a zero-shot sim-to-real user study with five participants controlling a physical robotic arm with noisy head movements, STREAMS (as an assistive mode) demonstrated significant improvements in trajectory stabilization, user satisfaction, and task performance reported as a success rate of 83% compared to manual mode which was 44% without any task support. STREAMS seeks to improve biosignal based assistive robotic controls by offering an interactive, end-to-end solution that stabilizes end-effector trajectories, enhancing task performance and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot-Gated Interactive Imitation Learning with Adaptive Intervention Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09176v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) allows agents to acquire desired behaviors through human interventions, but current methods impose high cognitive demands on human supervisors. We propose the Adaptive Intervention Mechanism (AIM), a novel robot-gated IIL algorithm that learns an adaptive criterion for requesting human demonstrations. AIM utilizes a proxy Q-function to mimic the human intervention rule and adjusts intervention requests based on the alignment between agent and human actions. By assigning high Q-values when the agent deviates from the expert and decreasing these values as the agent becomes proficient, the proxy Q-function enables the agent to assess the real-time alignment with the expert and request assistance when needed. Our expert-in-the-loop experiments reveal that AIM significantly reduces expert monitoring efforts in both continuous and discrete control tasks. Compared to the uncertainty-based baseline Thrifty-DAgger, our method achieves a 40% improvement in terms of human take-over cost and learning efficiency. Furthermore, AIM effectively identifies safety-critical states for expert assistance, thereby collecting higher-quality expert demonstrations and reducing overall expert data and environment interactions needed. Code and demo video are available at https://github.com/metadriverse/AIM.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Poster |

However, these efforts are challenged by the need to search large disaster zones, lack of reliability in the communications infrastructure, and a priori unknown numbers of objects of interest (OOIs), such as injured survivors. Aerial robots are increasingly being deployed for search and rescue due to their high mobility, but there remains a gap in deploying multi-robot autonomous aerial systems for methodical search of large environments. Prior works have relied on preprogrammed paths from human operators or are evaluated only in simulation. We bridge these gaps in the state of the art by developing and demonstrating a decentralized active search system, which biases its trajectories to take additional views of uncertain OOIs. The methodology leverages stochasticity for rapid coverage in communication denied scenarios. When communications are available, robots share poses, goals, and OOI information to accelerate the rate of search. Detections from multiple images and vehicles are fused to provide a mean and covariance for each OOI location. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments in Bloomingdale, OH, are conducted to validate the approach. The results demonstrate the active search approach outperforms greedy coverage-based planning in communication-denied scenarios while maintaining comparable performance in communication-enabled scenarios. The results also demonstrate the ability to detect and localize all a priori unknown OOIs with a mean error of approximately 3m at flight altitudes between 50m-60m.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ISER 2025</p></details> |

Robotic crash carts (RCCs) have shown promise in assisting healthcare teams during medical tasks through guided object searches and task reminders. Limited exploration has been done to determine what communication modalities are most effective and least disruptive to patient care in real-world settings. To address this gap, we conducted a between-subjects experiment comparing the RCC's verbal and non-verbal communication of object search with a standard crash cart in resuscitation scenarios to understand the impact of robot communication on workload and attitudes toward using robots in the workplace. Our findings indicate that verbal communication significantly reduced mental demand and effort compared to visual cues and with a traditional crash cart. Although frustration levels were slightly higher during collaborations with the robot compared to a traditional cart, these research insights provide valuable implications for human-robot teamwork in high-stakes environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's original submitted version of the paper accepted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN). \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

However, the accumulated noise in such dense representations has received insufficient attention, which degrades the representation quality and increases the likelihood of missed detections. To address this challenge, we propose the Wavelet Denoising-enhanced DEtection TRansformer, i.e., WD-DETR network, for event cameras. In particular, a dense event representation is presented first, which enables real-time reconstruction of events as tensors. Then, a wavelet transform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such a method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted features are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object prediction. To further reduce inference time, we incorporate the Dynamic Reorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) as a fusion module within the hybrid encoder. The proposed method has been evaluated on three event-based object detection datasets, i.e., DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx. The results demonstrate that WD-DETR outperforms tested state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we implement our approach on a common onboard computer for robots, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, achieving a high frame rate of approximately 35 FPS using TensorRT FP16, which is exceptionally well-suited for real-time perception of onboard robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://youtu.be/AQAgVdrx1DE</p></details> |
| **[Robot Pouring: Identifying Causes of Spillage and Selecting Alternative Action Parameters Using Probabilistic Actual Causation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09395v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In everyday life, we perform tasks (e.g., cooking or cleaning) that involve a large variety of objects and goals. When confronted with an unexpected or unwanted outcome, we take corrective actions and try again until achieving the desired result. The reasoning performed to identify a cause of the observed outcome and to select an appropriate corrective action is a crucial aspect of human reasoning for successful task execution. Central to this reasoning is the assumption that a factor is responsible for producing the observed outcome. In this paper, we investigate the use of probabilistic actual causation to determine whether a factor is the cause of an observed undesired outcome. Furthermore, we show how the actual causation probabilities can be used to find alternative actions to change the outcome. We apply the probabilistic actual causation analysis to a robot pouring task. When spillage occurs, the analysis indicates whether a task parameter is the cause and how it should be changed to avoid spillage. The analysis requires a causal graph of the task and the corresponding conditional probability distributions. To fulfill these requirements, we perform a complete causal modeling procedure (i.e., task analysis, definition of variables, determination of the causal graph structure, and estimation of conditional probability distributions) using data from a realistic simulation of the robot pouring task, covering a large combinatorial space of task parameters. Based on the results, we discuss the implications of the variables' representation and how the alternative actions suggested by the actual causation analysis would compare to the alternative solutions proposed by a human observer. The practical use of the analysis of probabilistic actual causation to select alternative action parameters is demonstrated.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Confidence Boosts Trust-Based Resilience in Cooperative Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08807v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wireless communication-based multi-robot systems open the door to cyberattacks that can disrupt safety and performance of collaborative robots. The physical channel supporting inter-robot communication offers an attractive opportunity to decouple the detection of malicious robots from task-relevant data exchange between legitimate robots. Yet, trustworthiness indications coming from physical channels are uncertain and must be handled with this in mind. In this paper, we propose a resilient protocol for multi-robot operation wherein a parameter {\lambda}t accounts for how confident a robot is about the legitimacy of nearby robots that the physical channel indicates. Analytical results prove that our protocol achieves resilient coordination with arbitrarily many malicious robots under mild assumptions. Tuning {\lambda}t allows a designer to trade between near-optimal inter-robot coordination and quick task execution; see Fig. 1. This is a fundamental performance tradeoff and must be carefully evaluated based on the task at hand. The effectiveness of our approach is numerically verified with experiments involving platoons of autonomous cars where some vehicles are maliciously spoofed.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Avatars - designed to facilitate worker interactions and engagement - are promising solutions to enhance the human-robot collaboration (HRC) experience. However, real-world perspectives on avatar-supported HRC remain unexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a focus group study with employees from a German manufacturing company that uses cobots. Before the discussion, participants engaged with a scripted, industry-like HRC demo in a lab setting. This qualitative approach provided valuable insights into the avatar's potential roles, improvements to its behavior, and practical considerations for deploying them in industrial workcells. Our findings also emphasize the importance of personalized communication and task assistance. Although our study's limitations restrict its generalizability, it serves as an initial step in recognizing the potential of adaptive, context-aware avatar interactions in real-world industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted LBW at CHIWORK 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Inverse Physics for Neuro-Symbolic Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08756v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world robotic applications, from autonomous exploration to assistive technologies, require adaptive, interpretable, and data-efficient learning paradigms. While deep learning architectures and foundation models have driven significant advances in diverse robotic applications, they remain limited in their ability to operate efficiently and reliably in unknown and dynamic environments. In this position paper, we critically assess these limitations and introduce a conceptual framework for combining data-driven learning with deliberate, structured reasoning. Specifically, we propose leveraging differentiable physics for efficient world modeling, Bayesian inference for uncertainty-aware decision-making, and meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new tasks. By embedding physical symbolic reasoning within neural models, robots could generalize beyond their training data, reason about novel situations, and continuously expand their knowledge. We argue that such hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures are essential for the next generation of autonomous systems, and to this end, we provide a research roadmap to guide and accelerate their development.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROS-related Robotic Systems Development with V-model-based Application of MeROS Metamodel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08706v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robotic systems grow increasingly complex, heterogeneous, and safety-critical, the need for structured development methodologies becomes paramount. Although frameworks like the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) offer foundational tools, they often lack integration when used together. This paper addresses that gap by aligning the widely recognized V-model development paradigm with the MeROS metamodel SysML-based modeling language tailored for ROS-based systems. We propose a domain-specific methodology that bridges ROS-centric modelling with systems engineering practices. Our approach formalises the structure, behaviour, and validation processes of robotic systems using MeROS, while extending it with a generalized, adaptable V-model compatible with both ROS and ROS 2. Rather than prescribing a fixed procedure, the approach supports project-specific flexibility and reuse, offering guidance across all stages of development. The approach is validated through a comprehensive case study on HeROS, a heterogeneous multi-robot platform comprising manipulators, mobile units, and dynamic test environments. This example illustrates how the MeROS-compatible V-model enhances traceability and system consistency while remaining accessible and extensible for future adaptation. The work contributes a structured, tool-agnostic foundation for developers and researchers seeking to apply MBSE practices in ROS-based projects.</p></details> | 19 pages |
