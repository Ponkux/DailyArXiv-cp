| **[Towards Agentic AI Networking in 6G: A Generative Foundation Model-as-Agent Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15764v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The promising potential of AI and network convergence in improving networking performance and enabling new service capabilities has recently attracted significant interest. Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under revision at IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |
| **[Latent Action Learning Requires Supervision in the Presence of Distractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00379v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[SpatialBot: Precise Spatial Understanding with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13642v7)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in 2D image understanding, however they are still struggling with spatial understanding which is the foundation of Embodied AI. In this paper, we propose SpatialBot for better spatial understanding by feeding both RGB and depth images. Additionally, we have constructed the SpatialQA dataset, which involves multi-level depth-related questions to train VLMs for depth understanding. Finally, we present SpatialBench to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' capabilities in spatial understanding at different levels. Extensive experiments on our spatial-understanding benchmark, general VLM benchmarks and Embodied AI tasks, demonstrate the remarkable improvements of SpatialBot trained on SpatialQA. The model, code and data are available at https://github.com/BAAI-DCAI/SpatialBot.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoK-RAG: Mixture of Knowledge Paths Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Embodied AI Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13882v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While human cognition inherently retrieves information from diverse and specialized knowledge sources during decision-making processes, current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically operate through single-source knowledge retrieval, leading to a cognitive-algorithmic discrepancy. To bridge this gap, we introduce MoK-RAG, a novel multi-source RAG framework that implements a mixture of knowledge paths enhanced retrieval mechanism through functional partitioning of a large language model (LLM) corpus into distinct sections, enabling retrieval from multiple specialized knowledge paths. Applied to the generation of 3D simulated environments, our proposed MoK-RAG3D enhances this paradigm by partitioning 3D assets into distinct sections and organizing them based on a hierarchical knowledge tree structure. Different from previous methods that only use manual evaluation, we pioneered the introduction of automated evaluation methods for 3D scenes. Both automatic and human evaluations in our experiments demonstrate that MoK-RAG3D can assist Embodied AI agents in generating diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Infinite Mobility: Scalable High-Fidelity Synthesis of Articulated Objects via Procedural Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13424v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale articulated objects with high quality are desperately needed for multiple tasks related to embodied AI. Most existing methods for creating articulated objects are either data-driven or simulation based, which are limited by the scale and quality of the training data or the fidelity and heavy labour of the simulation. In this paper, we propose Infinite Mobility, a novel method for synthesizing high-fidelity articulated objects through procedural generation. User study and quantitative evaluation demonstrate that our method can produce results that excel current state-of-the-art methods and are comparable to human-annotated datasets in both physics property and mesh quality. Furthermore, we show that our synthetic data can be used as training data for generative models, enabling next-step scaling up.

| **[Exploring 3D Activity Reasoning and Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D activity reasoning and planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advance in multimodal learning. However, most existing works share two constraints: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. To bridge the gaps, we propose 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans, and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[HIS-GPT: Towards 3D Human-In-Scene Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12955v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new task to benchmark human-in-scene understanding for embodied agents: Human-In-Scene Question Answering (HIS-QA). Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning in visual navigation of end-to-end trained agents: a dynamical systems approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08306v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Progress in Embodied AI has made it possible for end-to-end-trained agents to navigate in photo-realistic environments with high-level reasoning and zero-shot or language-conditioned behavior, but benchmarks are still dominated by simulation. In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control. An interactive tool is available at europe.naverlabs.com/research/publications/reasoning-in-visual-navigation-of-end-to-end-trained-agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[S2O: Static to Openable Enhancement for Articulated 3D Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18896v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite much progress in large 3D datasets there are currently few interactive 3D object datasets, and their scale is limited due to the manual effort required in their construction. We introduce the static to openable (S2O) task which creates interactive articulated 3D objects from static counterparts through openable part detection, motion prediction, and interior geometry completion. We formulate a unified framework to tackle this task, and curate a challenging dataset of openable 3D objects that serves as a test bed for systematic evaluation. Our experiments benchmark methods from prior work, extended and improved methods, and simple yet effective heuristics for the S2O task. We find that turning static 3D objects into interactively openable counterparts is possible but that all methods struggle to generalize to realistic settings of the task, and we highlight promising future work directions. Our work enables efficient creation of interactive 3D objects for robotic manipulation and embodied AI tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoMa-Kitchen: A 100K+ Benchmark for Affordance-Grounded Last-Mile Navigation in Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11081v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mobile manipulation, navigation and manipulation are often treated as separate problems, resulting in a significant gap between merely approaching an object and engaging with it effectively. Many navigation approaches primarily define success by proximity to the target, often overlooking the necessity for optimal positioning that facilitates subsequent manipulation. To address this, we introduce MoMa-Kitchen, a benchmark dataset comprising over 100k samples that provide training data for models to learn optimal final navigation positions for seamless transition to manipulation. Our dataset includes affordance-grounded floor labels collected from diverse kitchen environments, in which robotic mobile manipulators of different models attempt to grasp target objects amidst clutter. Using a fully automated pipeline, we simulate diverse real-world scenarios and generate affordance labels for optimal manipulation positions. Visual data are collected from RGB-D inputs captured by a first-person view camera mounted on the robotic arm, ensuring consistency in viewpoint during data collection. We also develop a lightweight baseline model, NavAff, for navigation affordance grounding that demonstrates promising performance on the MoMa-Kitchen benchmark. Our approach enables models to learn affordance-based final positioning that accommodates different arm types and platform heights, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable integration of navigation and manipulation in embodied AI.

| **[Making Every Frame Matter: Continuous Activity Recognition in Streaming Video via Adaptive Video Context Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14993v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video activity recognition has become increasingly important in robots and embodied AI. Recognizing continuous video activities poses considerable challenges due to the fast expansion of streaming video, which contains multi-scale and untrimmed activities. We introduce a novel system, CARS, to overcome these issues through adaptive video context modeling. Adaptive video context modeling refers to selectively maintaining activity-related features in temporal and spatial dimensions. CARS has two key designs. The first is an activity spatial feature extraction by eliminating irrelevant visual features while maintaining recognition accuracy. The second is an activity-aware state update introducing dynamic adaptability to better preserve the video context for multi-scale activity recognition. Our CARS runs at speeds $>$30 FPS on typical edge devices and outperforms all baselines by 1.2\% to 79.7\% in accuracy. Moreover, we explore applying CARS to a large video model as a video encoder. Experimental results show that our CARS can result in a 0.46-point enhancement (on a 5-point scale) on the in-distribution video activity dataset, and an improvement ranging from 1.19\% to 4\% on zero-shot video activity datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Long-horizon Embodied Planning with Implicit Logical Inference and Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15658v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon embodied planning underpins embodied AI. To accomplish long-horizon tasks, one of the most feasible ways is to decompose abstract instructions into a sequence of actionable steps. Foundation models still face logical errors and hallucinations in long-horizon planning, unless provided with highly relevant examples to the tasks. However, providing highly relevant examples for any random task is unpractical. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a novel framework for Real-time Long-horizon Embodied Planning. ReLEP can complete a wide range of long-horizon tasks without in-context examples by learning implicit logical inference through fine-tuning. The fine-tuned large vision-language model formulates plans as sequences of skill functions. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. When constructing the dataset, we considered the implicit logical relationships, enabling the model to learn implicit logical relationships and dispel hallucinations. Through comprehensive evaluations across various long-horizon tasks, ReLEP demonstrates high success rates and compliance to execution even on unseen tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[AhaRobot: A Low-Cost Open-Source Bimanual Mobile Manipulator for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10070v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation and manipulation in open-world environments remain unsolved challenges in the Embodied AI. The high cost of commercial mobile manipulation robots significantly limits research in real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose AhaRobot, a low-cost and fully open-source dual-arm mobile manipulation robot system with a hardware cost of only $1,000 (excluding optional computational resources), which is less than 1/15 of the cost of popular mobile robots. The AhaRobot system consists of three components: (1) a novel low-cost hardware architecture primarily composed of off-the-shelf components, (2) an optimized control solution to enhance operational precision integrating dual-motor backlash control and static friction compensation, and (3) a simple remote teleoperation method RoboPilot. We use handles to control the dual arms and pedals for whole-body movement. The teleoperation process is low-burden and easy to operate, much like piloting. RoboPilot is designed for remote data collection in embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboPilot significantly enhances data collection efficiency in complex manipulation tasks, achieving a 30% increase compared to methods using 3D mouse and leader-follower systems. It also excels at completing extremely long-horizon tasks in one go. Furthermore, AhaRobot can be used to learn end-to-end policies and autonomously perform complex manipulation tasks, such as pen insertion and cleaning up the floor. We aim to build an affordable yet powerful platform to promote the development of embodied tasks on real devices, advancing more robust and reliable embodied AI.

| **[EmBARDiment: an Embodied AI Agent for Productivity in XR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08158v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>XR devices running chat-bots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have the to become always-on agents that enable much better productivity scenarios. Current screen based chat-bots do not take advantage of the the full-suite of natural inputs available in XR, including inward facing sensor data, instead they over-rely on explicit voice or text prompts, sometimes paired with multi-modal data dropped as part of the query. We propose a solution that leverages an attention framework that derives context implicitly from user actions, eye-gaze, and contextual memory within the XR environment. Our work minimizes the need for engineered explicit prompts, fostering grounded and intuitive interactions that glean user insights for the chat-bot.</p></details> |  |
| **[HO-Cap: A Capture System and Dataset for 3D Reconstruction and Pose Tracking of Hand-Object Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06843v4)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a data capture system and a new dataset, HO-Cap, for 3D reconstruction and pose tracking of hands and objects in videos. The system leverages multiple RGBD cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Effectiveness of a Socratic Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning Method for Task Planning in Robotics, A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08174v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in reasoning with natural language. Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks. To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenFly: A Versatile Toolchain and Large-scale Benchmark for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents through an environment by leveraging both language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Dynamic Hand-Object Interactions with Applications to Human-Robot Handovers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04879v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans frequently grasp, manipulate, and move objects. Interactive systems assist humans in these tasks, enabling applications in Embodied AI, human-robot interaction, and virtual reality. However, current methods in hand-object synthesis often neglect dynamics and focus on generating static grasps. The first part of this dissertation introduces dynamic grasp synthesis, where a hand grasps and moves an object to a target pose. We approach this task using physical simulation and reinforcement learning. We then extend this to bimanual manipulation and articulated objects, requiring fine-grained coordination between hands. In the second part of this dissertation, we study human-to-robot handovers. We integrate captured human motion into simulation and introduce a student-teacher framework that adapts to human behavior and transfers from sim to real. To overcome data scarcity, we generate synthetic interactions, increasing training diversity by 100x. Our user study finds no difference between policies trained on synthetic vs. real motions.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |

However, real-world datasets often lack sufficient data for training and evaluation, and synthetic datasets, while larger, lack acoustic realism. Consequently, neither effectively meets practical needs. To address this issue, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit based on the embodied AI simulation platform Habitat-sim, designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim supports multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level adjustments, enabling the creation of more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a benchmark dataset called SonicSet, utilizing LibriSpeech, Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K), Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to investigate the differences between synthetic and real-world data, we selected 5 hours of raw, non-reverberant data from the SonicSet validation set and recorded a real-world speech separation dataset, providing a reference for comparing SonicSet with other synthetic datasets. For speech enhancement, we utilized the real-world dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between SonicSet and existing synthetic datasets. The results indicate that models trained on SonicSet generalize better to real-world scenarios compared to other synthetic datasets. The code is publicly available at https://cslikai.cn/SonicSim/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14093v4)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI is widely recognized as a key element of artificial general intelligence because it involves controlling embodied agents to perform tasks in the physical world. Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |
| **[WMNav: Integrating Vision-Language Models into World Models for Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02247v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Goal Navigation-requiring an agent to locate a specific object in an unseen environment-remains a core challenge in embodied AI. Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 11 figures, manuscript accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |

Affordance indicates where and how to grasp an object by taking its functionality into account, serving as the foundation for effective task-oriented grasping. However, current task-oriented methods often depend on extensive training data that is confined to specific tasks and objects, making it difficult to generalize to novel objects and complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce AffordGrasp, a novel open-vocabulary grasping framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) for in-context affordance reasoning. Unlike existing methods that rely on explicit task and object specifications, our approach infers tasks directly from implicit user instructions, enabling more intuitive and seamless human-robot interaction in everyday scenarios. Building on the reasoning outcomes, our framework identifies task-relevant objects and grounds their part-level affordances using a visual grounding module. This allows us to generate task-oriented grasp poses precisely within the affordance regions of the object, ensuring both functional and context-aware robotic manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. We believe our approach advances robotic manipulation techniques and contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://eqcy.github.io/affordgrasp/.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of prior magical grasp implementations at a fraction of the GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |
| **[Towards Robust and Secure Embodied AI: A Survey on Vulnerabilities and Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13175v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, including robots and autonomous vehicles, are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, where they encounter a range of vulnerabilities stemming from both environmental and system-level factors. These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Pattern Recognition Letters.

| **[MapNav: A Novel Memory Representation via Annotated Semantic Maps for VLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13451v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a key task in Embodied AI, requiring agents to navigate diverse and unseen environments while following natural language instructions. Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defining and Evaluating Visual Language Models' Basic Spatial Abilities: A Perspective from Psychometrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11859v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Theory of Multiple Intelligences underscores the hierarchical nature of cognitive capabilities. To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, when powered by open LLMs, they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a multicomponent memory system. In Minecraft experiments, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks where traditional Voyager fails without GPT-4, collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items and achieving $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones, advancing from basic wood tools to advanced iron equipment. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated collaborative experiences. MindForge advances the democratization of embodied AI development through open-ended social learning, enabling peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sce2DriveX: A Generalized MLLM Framework for Scene-to-Drive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14917v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving, which directly maps raw sensor inputs to low-level vehicle controls, is an important part of Embodied AI. Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |

Recent advances in foundation models pave the way for generative agents capable of richer communication and adaptive problem-solving. This survey provides a systematic examination of how EMAS can benefit from these generative capabilities. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes EMAS by system architectures and embodiment modalities, emphasizing how collaboration spans both physical and virtual contexts. Central building blocks, perception, planning, communication, and feedback, are then analyzed to illustrate how generative techniques bolster system robustness and flexibility. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the transformative effects of integrating foundation models into embodied, multi-agent frameworks. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions, underlining the significant promise of EMAS to reshape the landscape of AI-driven collaboration.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We propose a novel object-centric latent action learning approach, based on VideoSaur and LAPO, that employs self-supervised decomposition of scenes into object representations and annotates video data with proxy-action labels. This method effectively disentangles causal agent-object interactions from irrelevant background noise and reduces the performance degradation of latent action learning approaches caused by distractors. Our preliminary experiments with the Distracting Control Suite show that latent action pretraining based on object decompositions improve the quality of inferred latent actions by x2.7 and efficiency of downstream fine-tuning with a small set of labeled actions, increasing return by x2.6 on average.</p></details> | Preprint.

| **[POEX: Understanding and Mitigating Policy Executable Jailbreak Attacks against Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16633v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems are rapidly evolving due to the integration of LLMs as planning modules, which transform complex instructions into executable policies. However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

These advancements have led to an explosive increase in the demand for computational power, challenging the limits of Moore's Law. Optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing, faces significant challenges due to its high costs. To address this, various lithography simulators have been developed. However, many of these simulators are limited by their inadequate photoresist modeling capabilities. This paper presents TorchResist, an open-source, differentiable photoresist simulator.TorchResist employs an analytical approach to model the photoresist process, functioning as a white-box system with at most twenty interpretable parameters. Leveraging modern differentiable programming techniques and parallel computing on GPUs, TorchResist enables seamless co-optimization with other tools across multiple related tasks.

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefDrone: A Challenging Benchmark for Referring Expression Comprehension in Drone Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00392v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drones have become prevalent robotic platforms with diverse applications, showing significant potential in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI). Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code will be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |

This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions. This highlights the critical need for robust goal specification and safety frameworks before any physical implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected Version - Solved Some Issues with reference compilation by latex</p></details> |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

Nevertheless, the rapid development of MEANETs is accompanied by challenges in trustworthiness and operational efficiency. Fortunately, blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable characteristics, offers promising solutions for MEANETs. However, existing block propagation mechanisms suffer from challenges such as low propagation efficiency and weak security for block propagation, which results in delayed transmission of vehicular messages or vulnerability to malicious tampering, potentially causing severe traffic accidents in blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Moreover, current block propagation strategies cannot effectively adapt to real-time changes of dynamic topology in MEANETs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph Resfusion model-based trustworthy block propagation optimization framework for consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Specifically, we propose an innovative trust calculation mechanism based on the trust cloud model, which comprehensively accounts for randomness and fuzziness in the miner trust evaluation. Furthermore, by leveraging the strengths of graph neural networks and diffusion models, we develop a graph Resfusion model to effectively and adaptively generate the optimal block propagation trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other routing mechanisms in terms of block propagation efficiency and trustworthiness. Additionally, the results highlight its strong adaptability to dynamic environments, making it particularly suitable for rapidly changing MEANETs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</p></details> | Website: GenEx.world |

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

However, a standardized, closed-loop benchmark for evaluating their spatial reasoning and sequential decision-making capabilities is lacking. To address this, we present MetaVQA: a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess and enhance VLMs' understanding of spatial relationships and scene dynamics through Visual Question Answering (VQA) and closed-loop simulations. MetaVQA leverages Set-of-Mark prompting and top-down view ground-truth annotations from nuScenes and Waymo datasets to automatically generate extensive question-answer pairs based on diverse real-world traffic scenarios, ensuring object-centric and context-rich instructions. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with the MetaVQA dataset significantly improves their spatial reasoning and embodied scene comprehension in safety-critical simulations, evident not only in improved VQA accuracies but also in emerging safety-aware driving maneuvers. In addition, the learning demonstrates strong transferability from simulation to real-world observation.

However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks. This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context. Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior studies that explored this as long-form video understanding and utilized egocentric video only, we instead propose an LLM-based agent, Embodied VideoAgent, which constructs scene memory from both egocentric video and embodied sensory inputs (e.g. depth and pose sensing). We further introduce a VLM-based approach to automatically update the memory when actions or activities over objects are perceived. Embodied VideoAgent attains significant advantages over counterparts in challenging reasoning and planning tasks in 3D scenes, achieving gains of 4.9% on Ego4D-VQ3D, 5.8% on OpenEQA, and 11.7% on EnvQA.

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |

The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment.

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV.

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods.

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments.

While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/</p></details> |

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |
| **[ON as ALC: Active Loop Closing Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11523v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In simultaneous localization and mapping, active loop closing (ALC) is an active vision problem that aims to visually guide a robot to maximize the chances of revisiting previously visited points, thereby resetting the drift errors accumulated in the incrementally built map during travel. However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Grasp What You Want: Embodied Dexterous Grasping System Driven by Your Voice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10694v1)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, as robotics has advanced, human-robot collaboration has gained increasing importance. However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |

The central case study is Jess+ an intelligent digital score system for shared creativity with a mixed ensemble of non-disabled and disabled musicians. The overarching aim is that the digital score enables disabled musicians to thrive in a live music conversation with other musicians regardless of the potential barriers of disability and music-making. After defining what we mean by embodied AI and how this approach supports the aims of the Jess+ project, we outline the main design features of the system. This includes several novel approaches such as its modular design, an AI Factory based on an embodied musicking dataset, and an embedded belief system. Our findings showed that the implemented design decisions and embodied-AI approach led to rich experiences for the musicians which in turn transformed their practice as an inclusive ensemble.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models in Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07904v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated a wide range of capabilities across many domains, including Embodied AI. In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This study finds that state-of-the-art embodied AI agents compete for higher navigation quality, but often compromise the computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce "Skip-SCAR," an optimization framework that builds computationally and memory-efficient embodied AI agents to accomplish high-quality visual navigation tasks. Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint. Tested on the HM3D ObjectNav datasets and real-world physical hardware systems, Skip-SCAR not only minimizes hardware resources but also sets new performance benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of optimizing both navigation quality and computational efficiency for robotics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Privacy Risks in Reinforcement Learning for Household Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09273v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prominence of embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI), which empowers robots to navigate, perceive, and engage within virtual environments, has attracted significant attention, owing to the remarkable advances in computer vision and large language models. Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functionality understanding and segmentation in 3D scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16310v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

Despite recent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods often lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in scenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this paper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and scalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors and multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion (OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved surfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric fidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital twins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM-based planners are inefficient due to their large number of parameters and prone to inaccuracies because they operate in open-loop systems. We think the reason is that only applying LLMs as planners is insufficient. In this work, we propose DaDu-E, a robust closed-loop planning framework for embodied AI robots. Specifically, DaDu-E is equipped with a relatively lightweight LLM, a set of encapsulated robot skill instructions, a robust feedback system, and memory augmentation. Together, these components enable DaDu-E to (i) actively perceive and adapt to dynamic environments, (ii) optimize computational costs while maintaining high performance, and (iii) recover from execution failures using its memory and feedback mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world and simulated tasks show that DaDu-E achieves task success rates comparable to embodied AI robots with larger models as planners like COME-Robot, while reducing computational requirements by $6.6 \times$.

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters, connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and easy integration with downstream tasks. We provide open access to our dataset, benchmark, and method's source code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Reward and Policy Jointly from Demonstration and Preference Improves Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06874v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for building contemporary foundation models and embodied AI. However, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning task. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant under-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward model and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment performance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated Human Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and demonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach admits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and leverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy Optimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment pipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with extensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially when the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[EARBench: Towards Evaluating Physical Risk Awareness for Task Planning of Foundation Model-based Embodied AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04449v5)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) integrates advanced AI models into physical entities for real-world interaction. The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EARBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EARDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downstream tasks. Image-to-video diffusion models are already capable of generating highly realistic synthetic videos. However, these models are not action-conditioned, and the most powerful models are closed-source which means they cannot be finetuned. In this work, we propose to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to action-conditioned world models, without access to the parameters of the pretrained model. Our approach, AVID, trains an adapter on a small domain-specific dataset of action-labelled videos. AVID uses a learned mask to modify the intermediate outputs of the pretrained model and generate accurate action-conditioned videos. We evaluate AVID on video game and real-world robotics data, and show that it outperforms existing baselines for diffusion model adaptation.1 Our results demonstrate that if utilized correctly, pretrained video models have the potential to be powerful tools for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/avid-world-model-adapters/home</p></details> |

In this study, we introduce ROOT, a VLM-based system designed to enhance the analysis of indoor scenes. Specifically, we first develop an iterative object perception algorithm using GPT-4V to detect object entities within indoor scenes. This is followed by employing vision foundation models to acquire additional meta-information about the scene, such as bounding boxes. Building on this foundational data, we propose a specialized VLM, SceneVLM, which is capable of generating spatial hierarchical scene graphs and providing distance information for objects within indoor environments. This information enhances our understanding of the spatial arrangement of indoor scenes. To train our SceneVLM, we collect over 610,000 images from various public indoor datasets and implement a scene data generation pipeline with a semi-automated technique to establish relationships and estimate distances among indoor objects. By utilizing this enriched data, we conduct various training recipes and finish SceneVLM. Our experiments demonstrate that \rootname facilitates indoor scene understanding and proves effective in diverse downstream applications, such as 3D scene generation and embodied AI. The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/harrytea/ROOT}.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs and 3D segmentation masks. In addition, we design MORE3D, a simple yet effective method that enables multi-object 3D reasoning segmentation with user questions and textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation.

A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame-basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes Corki, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI robot control. Our idea is to decouple LLM inference, robotic control and data communication in the embodied AI robots compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, Corki predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. Corki largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to 8.0x, resulting in up to 3.6x speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 17.3%. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/hyy0613/Corki</p></details> |  |

Generated models frequently fail to maintain balance when placed in physics-based simulations or 3D printed. This balance is crucial for satisfying user design intentions in interactive gaming, embodied AI, and robotics, where stable models are needed for reliable interaction. Additionally, stable models ensure that 3D-printed objects, such as figurines for home decoration, can stand on their own without requiring additional supports. To fill this gap, we introduce Atlas3D, an automatic and easy-to-implement method that enhances existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D tools. Atlas3D ensures the generation of self-supporting 3D models that adhere to physical laws of stability under gravity, contact, and friction. Our approach combines a novel differentiable simulation-based loss function with physically inspired regularization, serving as either a refinement or a post-processing module for existing frameworks. We verify Atlas3D's efficacy through extensive generation tasks and validate the resulting 3D models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunuoch.github.io/Atlas3D/</p></details> |

Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing Architect, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene.

Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, \textit{i.e.}, pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the strategy of representation. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multi-faceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multi-modal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: \url{https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey}.</p></details> |  |

Scene Retrieval with Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14565v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interfaces to embodied AI are becoming more ubiquitous in our daily lives. This opens up further opportunities for language-based interaction with embodied agents, such as a user verbally instructing an agent to execute some task in a specific location. For example, "put the bowls back in the cupboard next to the fridge" or "meet me at the intersection under the red sign." As such, we need methods that interface between natural language and map representations of the environment. To this end, we explore the question of whether we can use an open-set natural language query to identify a scene represented by a 3D scene graph. We define this task as "language-based scene-retrieval" and it is closely related to "coarse-localization," but we are instead searching for a match from a collection of disjoint scenes and not necessarily a large-scale continuous map. We present Text2SceneGraphMatcher, a "scene-retrieval" pipeline that learns joint embeddings between text descriptions and scene graphs to determine if they are a match. The code, trained models, and datasets will be made public.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

| **[3D Audio-Visual Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02236v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing the sounding objects in scenes is a longstanding objective in embodied AI, with diverse applications in robotics and AR/VR/MR. To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

However, current VLN frameworks often rely on static environments and optimal expert supervision, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation (HA-VLN), extending traditional VLN by incorporating dynamic human activities and relaxing key assumptions. We propose the Human-Aware 3D (HA3D) simulator, which combines dynamic human activities with the Matterport3D dataset, and the Human-Aware Room-to-Room (HA-R2R) dataset, extending R2R with human activity descriptions. To tackle HA-VLN challenges, we present the Expert-Supervised Cross-Modal (VLN-CM) and Non-Expert-Supervised Decision Transformer (VLN-DT) agents, utilizing cross-modal fusion and diverse training strategies for effective navigation in dynamic human environments. A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability. Ultimately, this work provides benchmarks and insights for future research on embodied AI and Sim2Real transfer, paving the way for more realistic and applicable VLN systems in human-populated environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight at NeurIPS 2024 D&B Track. 32 pages, 18 figures, Project Page: https://lpercc.github.io/HA3D_simulator/</p></details> |

Our system is modular: it deploys state of the art Large Language Models for task planning,Vision-Language models for semantic perception, and Point Cloud transformers for grasping. With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities. One may also in-place swap modules to improve the robustness of the overall platform, for instance with imitation-learned policies.

At present, many evaluation platforms with rich scenes, high visual fidelity and various application scenarios have been developed. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework named NeuronsGym that can be used for policy learning of robot tasks, covering a simulation platform for training policy, and a physical system for studying sim2real problems. Unlike most current single-task, slow-moving robotic platforms, our framework provides agile physical robots with a wider range of speeds, and can be employed to train robotic navigation and confrontation policies. At the same time, in order to evaluate the safety of robot navigation, we propose a safety-weighted path length (SFPL) to improve the safety evaluation in the current mobile robot navigation. Based on this platform, we build a new benchmark for navigation and confrontation tasks under this platform by comparing the current mainstream sim2real methods, and hold the 2022 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) RoboMaster sim2real challenge. We release the codes of this framework\footnote{\url{https://github.com/DRL-CASIA/NeuronsGym}} and hope that this platform can promote the development of more flexible and agile general mobile agent algorithms.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2 reasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences improve performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due to verbose and redundant outputs, known as the "overthinking phenomenon". In this paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically investigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient reasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we categorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based efficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models into more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning models; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to dynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input prompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency based on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control. Additionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning models, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and discuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://github.com/Eclipsess/Awesome-Efficient-Reasoning-LLMs</p></details> |

In its current implementation, DIDP guides the search using user-defined dual bounds. Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly being applied to combinatorial optimization problems and shares several key structures with DP, being represented by the Bellman equation and state-based transition systems. We propose using reinforcement learning to obtain a heuristic function to guide the search in DIDP. We develop two RL-based guidance approaches: value-based guidance using Deep Q-Networks and policy-based guidance using Proximal Policy Optimization. Our experiments indicate that RL-based guidance significantly outperforms standard DIDP and problem-specific greedy heuristics with the same number of node expansions. Further, despite longer node evaluation times, RL guidance achieves better run-time performance than standard DIDP on three of four benchmark domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, to be published in CPAIOR 2025 (https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2025)</p></details> |

However, their capabilities in handling complex financial tasks still require in-depth exploration. In this paper, we introduce Fin-R1, a reasoning large language model specifically designed for the financial sector. Fin-R1 is built using a two-stage architecture, leveraging a financial reasoning dataset distilled and processed based on DeepSeek-R1. Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) training, it demonstrates performance close to DeepSeek-R1 with a parameter size of 7 billion across a range of financial reasoning tasks. It achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in the FinQA and ConvFinQA tasks between those LLMs in our evaluation, surpassing larger models in other tasks as well. Fin-R1 showcases strong reasoning and decision-making capabilities, providing solutions to various problems encountered in the financial domain.

| **[Navigating Demand Uncertainty in Container Shipping: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Enabling Adaptive and Feasible Master Stowage Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12756v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in solving various combinatorial optimization problems. However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we focus on using RL in container shipping, often considered the cornerstone of global trade, by dealing with the critical challenge of master stowage planning. The main objective is to maximize cargo revenue and minimize operational costs while navigating demand uncertainty and various complex operational constraints, namely vessel capacity and stability, which must be dynamically updated along the vessel's voyage. To address this problem, we implement a deep reinforcement learning framework with feasibility projection to solve the master stowage planning problem (MPP) under demand uncertainty. The experimental results show that our architecture efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions for this multi-stage stochastic optimization problem, outperforming traditional mixed-integer programming and RL with feasibility regularization. Our AI-driven decision-support policy enables adaptive and feasible planning under uncertainty, optimizing operational efficiency and capacity utilization while contributing to sustainable and resilient global supply chains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review for IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

Our study investigates the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning in small LLMs, focusing on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, under strict constraints: training on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs (48 GB VRAM each) within 24 hours. Adapting the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curating a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, we conducted three experiments to explore model behavior and performance. Our results demonstrate rapid reasoning gains - e.g., AMC23 accuracy rising from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing o1-preview - using only 7,000 samples and a $42 training cost, compared to thousands of dollars for baseline models. However, challenges such as optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. These findings highlight the efficacy of RL-based fine-tuning for small LLMs, offering a cost-effective alternative to large-scale approaches. We release our code and datasets as open-source resources, providing insights into trade-offs and laying a foundation for scalable, reasoning-capable LLMs in resource-limited environments.

This study addresses this challenge via imitation-based deep reinforcement learning with a progressive training process. To start, we learn the jumping skill by mimicking a coarse jumping example generated by model-based trajectory optimization. Subsequently, we generalize the learned policy to broader situations, including various distances in both forward and lateral directions, and then pursue robust jumping in unknown ground unevenness. In addition, without tuning the reward much, we learn the jumping policy for a quadruped with parallel elasticity. Results show that using the proposed method, i) the robot learns versatile jumps by learning only from a single demonstration, ii) the robot with parallel compliance reduces the landing error by 11.1%, saves energy cost by 15.2% and reduces the peak torque by 15.8%, compared to the rigid robot without parallel elasticity, iii) the robot can perform jumps of variable distances with robustness against ground unevenness (maximal 4cm height perturbations) using only proprioceptive perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, submitted to IROS2025</p></details> |
| **[Nonparametric Bellman Mappings for Value Iteration in Distributed Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16192v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces novel Bellman mappings (B-Maps) for value iteration (VI) in distributed reinforcement learning (DRL), where multiple agents operate over a network without a centralized fusion node. Each agent constructs its own nonparametric B-Map for VI while communicating only with direct neighbors to achieve consensus. These B-Maps operate on Q-functions represented in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, enabling a nonparametric formulation that allows for flexible, agent-specific basis function design. Unlike existing DRL methods that restrict information exchange to Q-function estimates, the proposed framework also enables agents to share basis information in the form of covariance matrices, capturing additional structural details. A theoretical analysis establishes linear convergence rates for both Q-function and covariance-matrix estimates toward their consensus values. The optimal learning rates for consensus-based updates are dictated by the ratio of the smallest positive eigenvalue to the largest one of the network's Laplacian matrix. Furthermore, each nodal Q-function estimate is shown to lie very close to the fixed point of a centralized nonparametric B-Map, effectively allowing the proposed DRL design to approximate the performance of a centralized fusion center. Numerical experiments on two well-known control problems demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed nonparametric B-Maps compared to prior methods. Notably, the results reveal a counter-intuitive finding: although the proposed approach involves greater information exchange -- specifically through the sharing of covariance matrices -- it achieves the desired performance with lower cumulative communication cost than existing DRL schemes, highlighting the crucial role of basis information in accelerating the learning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLS-RL: Image Classification with Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16188v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification is a core task in machine learning. Recent research has shown that although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are initially poor at image classification, fine-tuning them with an adequate amount of data can significantly enhance their performance, making them comparable to SOTA classification models. However, acquiring large-scale labeled data is expensive. In this paper, we explore few-shot MLLM classification fine-tuning. We found that SFT can cause severe overfitting issues and may even degrade performance over the zero-shot approach. To address this challenge, inspired by the recent successes in rule-based reinforcement learning, we propose CLS-RL, which uses verifiable signals as reward to fine-tune MLLMs. We discovered that CLS-RL outperforms SFT in most datasets and has a much higher average accuracy on both base-to-new and few-shot learning setting. Moreover, we observed a free-lunch phenomenon for CLS-RL; when models are fine-tuned on a particular dataset, their performance on other distinct datasets may also improve over zero-shot models, even if those datasets differ in distribution and class names. This suggests that RL-based methods effectively teach models the fundamentals of classification. Lastly, inspired by recent works in inference time thinking, we re-examine the `thinking process' during fine-tuning, a critical aspect of RL-based methods, in the context of visual classification. We question whether such tasks require extensive thinking process during fine-tuning, proposing that this may actually detract from performance. Based on this premise, we introduce the No-Thinking-CLS-RL method, which minimizes thinking processes during training by setting an equality accuracy reward. Our findings indicate that, with much less fine-tuning time, No-Thinking-CLS-RL method achieves superior in-domain performance and generalization capabilities than CLS-RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Sample Efficient Preference Alignment in LLMs via Active Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00267v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based feedback is important for many applications in machine learning where evaluation of a reward function is not feasible. Notable recent examples arise in preference alignment for large language models, including in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). For many applications of preference alignment, the cost of acquiring human feedback can be substantial. In this work, we take advantage of the fact that one can often choose contexts at which to obtain human feedback to most efficiently identify a good policy, and formalize the setting as an active contextual dueling bandit problem. We propose an active exploration algorithm to efficiently select the data and provide theoretical proof that it has a polynomial worst-case regret bound. We extend the setting and methodology for practical use in preference alignment of large language models. We provide two extensions, an online and an offline approach. Our method outperforms the baselines with limited samples of human preferences on several language models and four real-world datasets including two new datasets that we contribute to the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLOMM: An Efficient and Robust Online Map Matching Framework with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06825v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online map matching is a fundamental problem in location-based services, aiming to incrementally match trajectory data step-by-step onto a road network. However, existing methods fail to meet the needs for efficiency, robustness, and accuracy required by large-scale online applications, making this task still challenging. This paper introduces a novel framework that achieves high accuracy and efficient matching while ensuring robustness in handling diverse scenarios. To improve efficiency, we begin by modeling the online map matching problem as an Online Markov Decision Process (OMDP) based on its inherent characteristics. This approach helps efficiently merge historical and real-time data, reducing unnecessary calculations. Next, to enhance robustness, we design a reinforcement learning method, enabling robust handling of real-time data from dynamically changing environments. In particular, we propose a novel model learning process and a comprehensive reward function, allowing the model to make reasonable current matches from a future-oriented perspective, and to continuously update and optimize during the decision-making process based on feedback. Lastly, to address the heterogeneity between trajectories and roads, we design distinct graph structures, facilitating efficient representation learning through graph and recurrent neural networks. To further align trajectory and road data, we introduce contrastive learning to decrease their distance in the latent space, thereby promoting effective integration of the two. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets confirm that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of accuracy, efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGMOD 2025</p></details> |

| **[Cultural Alignment in Large Language Models Using Soft Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16094v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) alignment conventionally relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning based alignment frameworks. These methods typically require labeled or preference datasets and involve updating model weights to align the LLM with the training objective or reward model. Meanwhile, in social sciences such as cross-cultural studies, factor analysis is widely used to uncover underlying dimensions or latent variables that explain observed patterns in survey data. The non-differentiable nature of these measurements deriving from survey data renders the former alignment methods infeasible for alignment with cultural dimensions. To overcome this, we propose a parameter efficient strategy that combines soft prompt tuning, which freezes the model parameters while modifying the input prompt embeddings, with Differential Evolution (DE), a black-box optimization method for cases where a differentiable objective is unattainable. This strategy ensures alignment consistency without the need for preference data or model parameter updates, significantly enhancing efficiency and mitigating overfitting. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in LLama-3-8B-Instruct's cultural dimensions across multiple regions, outperforming both the Naive LLM and the In-context Learning (ICL) baseline, and effectively bridges computational models with human cultural nuances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relational Object-Centric Actor-Critic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17178v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advances in unsupervised object-centric representation learning have significantly improved its application to downstream tasks. Recent works highlight that disentangled object representations can aid policy learning in image-based, object-centric reinforcement learning tasks. This paper proposes a novel object-centric reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates actor-critic and model-based approaches by incorporating an object-centric world model within the critic. The world model captures the environment's data-generating process by predicting the next state and reward given the current state-action pair, where actions are interventions in the environment. In model-based reinforcement learning, world model learning can be interpreted as a causal induction problem, where the agent must learn the causal relationships underlying the environment's dynamics. We evaluate our method in a simulated 3D robotic environment and a 2D environment with compositional structure. As baselines, we compare against object-centric, model-free actor-critic algorithms and a state-of-the-art monolithic model-based algorithm. While the baselines show comparable performance in easier tasks, our approach outperforms them in more challenging scenarios with a large number of objects or more complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[OThink-MR1: Stimulating multimodal generalized reasoning capabilities through dynamic reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16081v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Language Models have gained significant traction for their ability to process diverse input data types and generate coherent, contextually relevant outputs across various applications. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been the predominant approach to enhance MLLM capabilities in task-specific optimization, it often falls short in fostering crucial generalized reasoning abilities. Despite the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to address these limitations, it faces two issues: (1) its generalized capabilities in multimodal tasks remain underexplored. (2) its training constraints such as constant Kullback-Leibler or clamp strategy easily lead to suboptimal bottleneck. To adress these issues, we introduce OThink-MR1, a framework that extends RL to MLLMs, enabling them to achieve deeper understanding and reasoning across multimodal tasks. We design a dynamic Kullback-Leibler strategy that significantly enhances RL performance, surpassing SFT in same-task evaluations. Also, we are the first to reveal that RL exhibits remarkable cross-task generalization capabilities, which shows that models post-trained with RL on one multimodal task can be effectively transfered to another tasks. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the great reasoning ability of our proposed OThink-MR1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crowd-PrefRL: Preference-Based Reward Learning from Crowds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10941v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based reinforcement learning (RL) provides a framework to train AI agents using human feedback through preferences over pairs of behaviors, enabling agents to learn desired behaviors when it is difficult to specify a numerical reward function. While this paradigm leverages human feedback, it typically treats the feedback as given by a single human user. However, different users may desire multiple AI behaviors and modes of interaction. Meanwhile, incorporating preference feedback from crowds (i.e. ensembles of users) in a robust manner remains a challenge, and the problem of training RL agents using feedback from multiple human users remains understudied. In this work, we introduce a conceptual framework, Crowd-PrefRL, that integrates preference-based RL approaches with techniques from unsupervised crowdsourcing to enable training of autonomous system behaviors from crowdsourced feedback. We show preliminary results suggesting that Crowd-PrefRL can learn reward functions and agent policies from preference feedback provided by crowds of unknown expertise and reliability. We also show that in most cases, agents trained with Crowd-PrefRL outperform agents trained with majority-vote preferences or preferences from any individual user, especially when the spread of user error rates among the crowd is large. Results further suggest that our method can identify the presence of minority viewpoints within the crowd in an unsupervised manner.</p></details> |  |

A widely used paradigm is to pretrain neural networks on string representations of molecules and fine-tune them using reinforcement learning on specific objectives. However, string-based models face challenges in ensuring chemical validity and enforcing structural constraints like the presence of specific substructures. We propose to instead combine graph-based molecular representations, which can naturally ensure chemical validity, with transformer architectures, which are highly expressive and capable of modeling long-range dependencies between atoms. Our approach iteratively modifies a molecular graph by adding atoms and bonds, which ensures chemical validity and facilitates the incorporation of structural constraints. We present GraphXForm, a decoder-only graph transformer architecture, which is pretrained on existing compounds and then fine-tuned using a new training algorithm that combines elements of the deep cross-entropy method and self-improvement learning. We evaluate GraphXForm on various drug design tasks, demonstrating superior objective scores compared to state-of-the-art molecular design approaches. Furthermore, we apply GraphXForm to two solvent design tasks for liquid-liquid extraction, again outperforming alternative methods while flexibly enforcing structural constraints or initiating design from existing molecular structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Digital Discovery, 2025</p></details> |
| **[IPO: Your Language Model is Secretly a Preference Classifier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16182v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the primary method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. While it enables LLMs to achieve human-level alignment, it often incurs significant computational and financial costs due to its reliance on training external reward models or human-labeled preferences. In this work, we propose Implicit Preference Optimization (IPO), an alternative approach that leverages generative LLMs as preference classifiers, thereby reducing the dependence on external human feedback or reward models to obtain preferences. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the preference classification ability of LLMs using RewardBench, assessing models across different sizes, architectures, and training levels to validate our hypothesis. Furthermore, we investigate the self-improvement capabilities of LLMs by generating multiple responses for a given instruction and employing the model itself as a preference classifier for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based training. Our findings demonstrate that models trained through IPO achieve performance comparable to those utilizing state-of-the-art reward models for obtaining preferences.</p></details> |  |
| **[A policy gradient approach for Finite Horizon Constrained Markov Decision Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04527v5)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The infinite horizon setting is widely adopted for problems of reinforcement learning (RL). These invariably result in stationary policies that are optimal. In many situations, finite horizon control problems are of interest and for such problems, the optimal policies are time-varying in general. Another setting that has become popular in recent times is of Constrained Reinforcement Learning, where the agent maximizes its rewards while it also aims to satisfy some given constraint criteria. However, this setting has only been studied in the context of infinite horizon MDPs where stationary policies are optimal. We present an algorithm for constrained RL in the Finite Horizon Setting where the horizon terminates after a fixed (finite) time. We use function approximation in our algorithm which is essential when the state and action spaces are large or continuous and use the policy gradient method to find the optimal policy. The optimal policy that we obtain depends on the stage and so is non-stationary in general. To the best of our knowledge, our paper presents the first policy gradient algorithm for the finite horizon setting with constraints. We show the convergence of our algorithm to a constrained optimal policy. We also compare and analyze the performance of our algorithm through experiments and show that our algorithm performs better than some other well known algorithms.</p></details> |  |

We present a human-in-the-loop vision-based RL system that demonstrates impressive performance on a diverse set of dexterous manipulation tasks, including dynamic manipulation, precision assembly, and dual-arm coordination. Our approach integrates demonstrations and human corrections, efficient RL algorithms, and other system-level design choices to learn policies that achieve near-perfect success rates and fast cycle times within just 1 to 2.5 hours of training. We show that our method significantly outperforms imitation learning baselines and prior RL approaches, with an average 2x improvement in success rate and 1.8x faster execution. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating how it learns robust, adaptive policies for both reactive and predictive control strategies. Our results suggest that RL can indeed learn a wide range of complex vision-based manipulation policies directly in the real world within practical training times. We hope this work will inspire a new generation of learned robotic manipulation techniques, benefiting both industrial applications and research advancements.

However, despite these advances, robotic RL remains hard to use. It is acknowledged among practitioners that the particular implementation details of these algorithms are often just as important (if not more so) for performance as the choice of algorithm. We posit that a significant challenge to widespread adoption of robotic RL, as well as further development of robotic RL methods, is the comparative inaccessibility of such methods. To address this challenge, we developed a carefully implemented library containing a sample efficient off-policy deep RL method, together with methods for computing rewards and resetting the environment, a high-quality controller for a widely-adopted robot, and a number of challenging example tasks. We provide this library as a resource for the community, describe its design choices, and present experimental results. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that our implementation can achieve very efficient learning, acquiring policies for PCB board assembly, cable routing, and object relocation between 25 to 50 minutes of training per policy on average, improving over state-of-the-art results reported for similar tasks in the literature. These policies achieve perfect or near-perfect success rates, extreme robustness even under perturbations, and exhibit emergent recovery and correction behaviors. We hope that these promising results and our high-quality open-source implementation will provide a tool for the robotics community to facilitate further developments in robotic RL.

Unreal-MAP allows users to freely create multi-agent tasks using the vast visual and physical resources available in the UE community, and deploy state-of-the-art (SOTA) MARL algorithms within them. Unreal-MAP is user-friendly in terms of deployment, modification, and visualization, and all its components are open-source. We also develop an experimental framework compatible with algorithms ranging from rule-based to learning-based provided by third-party frameworks. Lastly, we deploy several SOTA algorithms in example tasks developed via Unreal-MAP, and conduct corresponding experimental analyses. We believe Unreal-MAP can play an important role in the MARL field by closely integrating existing algorithms with user-customized tasks, thus advancing the field of MARL.</p></details> |  |

Concept bottleneck models offer an interpretable alternative by integrating human-understandable concepts into policies. However, prior work assumes that concept annotations are readily available during training. For RL, this requirement poses a significant limitation: it necessitates continuous real-time concept annotation, which either places an impractical burden on human annotators or incurs substantial costs in API queries and inference time when employing automated labeling methods. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel training scheme that enables RL agents to efficiently learn a concept-based policy by only querying annotators to label a small set of data. Our algorithm, LICORICE, involves three main contributions: interleaving concept learning and RL training, using an ensemble to actively select informative data points for labeling, and decorrelating the concept data. We show how LICORICE reduces human labeling efforts to 500 or fewer concept labels in three environments, and 5000 or fewer in two more complex environments, all at no cost to performance. We also explore the use of VLMs as automated concept annotators, finding them effective in some cases but imperfect in others. Our work significantly reduces the annotation burden for interpretable RL, making it more practical for real-world applications that necessitate transparency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

The algorithm uses a modified replay buffer inspired by the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) approach to artificially populate experience with successful trajectories, effectively addressing the problem of sparse reward scenarios and eliminating the need to manually collect expert demonstrations. The developed algorithm proposes a Transformer-based architecture to incorporate the context of previous states, allowing the agent to perform a deeper analysis and make decisions in a manner more akin to human learning. The effectiveness of the built-in replay buffer, which acts as an "internal demonstrator", is twofold: it accelerates learning and allows the algorithm to adapt to different tasks. Empirical data confirm the superiority of the algorithm by an average of 38.46% over other considered methods, and the most successful baseline by 28.21%, showing higher success rates and faster convergence in the point-reaching task. Since the control is performed through the robot's joints, the algorithm facilitates potential adaptation to a real robot system and construction of an obstacle avoidance task. Therefore, the algorithm has also been tested on tasks requiring following a complex dynamic trajectory and obstacle avoidance. The design of the algorithm ensures its applicability to a wide range of goal-oriented tasks, making it an easily integrated solution for real-world robotics applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

Battery-powered WSNs offer various advantages over wired systems, however limited battery life has always been one of the biggest obstacles in practical use of the WSNs, regardless of energy harvesting methods. While various methods have been studied for battery health management, existing methods exclusively aim to extend lifetime of individual batteries, lacking a system level view. A consequence of applying such methods is that batteries in a WSN tend to fail at different times, posing significant difficulty on planning and scheduling of battery replacement trip. This study investigate a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for active battery degradation management by optimizing duty cycle of WSNs at the system level. This active management strategy effectively reduces earlier failure of battery individuals which enable group replacement without sacrificing WSN performances. A simulated environment based on a real-world WSN setup was developed to train a DRL agent and learn optimal duty cycle strategies. The performance of the strategy was validated in a long-term setup with various network sizes, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Policy Evaluation with Safety Constraint for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05655v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning, classic on-policy evaluation methods often suffer from high variance and require massive online data to attain the desired accuracy. Previous studies attempt to reduce evaluation variance by searching for or designing proper behavior policies to collect data. However, these approaches ignore the safety of such behavior policies -- the designed behavior policies have no safety guarantee and may lead to severe damage during online executions. In this paper, to address the challenge of reducing variance while ensuring safety simultaneously, we propose an optimal variance-minimizing behavior policy under safety constraints. Theoretically, while ensuring safety constraints, our evaluation method is unbiased and has lower variance than on-policy evaluation. Empirically, our method is the only existing method to achieve both substantial variance reduction and safety constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, we show our method is even superior to previous methods in both variance reduction and execution safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.02226</p></details> |
| **[Doubly Optimal Policy Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02226v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy evaluation estimates the performance of a policy by (1) collecting data from the environment and (2) processing raw data into a meaningful estimate. Due to the sequential nature of reinforcement learning, any improper data-collecting policy or data-processing method substantially deteriorates the variance of evaluation results over long time steps. Thus, policy evaluation often suffers from large variance and requires massive data to achieve the desired accuracy. In this work, we design an optimal combination of data-collecting policy and data-processing baseline. Theoretically, we prove our doubly optimal policy evaluation method is unbiased and guaranteed to have lower variance than previously best-performing methods. Empirically, compared with previous works, we show our method reduces variance substantially and achieves superior empirical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Local Selection: Global Cut Selection for Enhanced Mixed-Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15847v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed-integer programming (MIP) solvers, cutting planes are essential for Branch-and-Cut (B&C) algorithms as they reduce the search space and accelerate the solving process. Traditional methods rely on hard-coded heuristics for cut plane selection but fail to leverage problem-specific structural features. Recent machine learning approaches use neural networks for cut selection but focus narrowly on the efficiency of single-node within the B&C algorithm, without considering the broader contextual information. To address this, we propose Global Cut Selection (GCS), which uses a bipartite graph to represent the search tree and combines graph neural networks with reinforcement learning to develop cut selection strategies. Unlike prior methods, GCS applies cutting planes across all nodes, incorporating richer contextual information. Experiments show GCS significantly improves solving efficiency for synthetic and large-scale real-world MIPs compared to traditional and learning-based methods.</p></details> |  |

However, previous studies rarely focus on accumulating exploratory experience by adjusting generative structures, which leads to disorientation in complex sampling spaces. Efforts to address this issue, such as LS-GFN, are limited to local greedy searches and lack broader global adjustments. This paper introduces a novel variant of GFNs, the Dynamic Backtracking GFN (DB-GFN), which improves the adaptability of decision-making steps through a reward-based dynamic backtracking mechanism. DB-GFN allows backtracking during the network construction process according to the current state's reward value, thereby correcting disadvantageous decisions and exploring alternative pathways during the exploration process. When applied to generative tasks involving biochemical molecules and genetic material sequences, DB-GFN outperforms GFN models such as LS-GFN and GTB, as well as traditional reinforcement learning methods, in sample quality, sample exploration quantity, and training convergence speed. Additionally, owing to its orthogonal nature, DB-GFN shows great potential in future improvements of GFNs, and it can be integrated with other strategies to achieve higher search performance.</p></details> |  |

Disentangling aleatoric uncertainty (the inherent randomness of the system) from epistemic uncertainty (the lack of data) is crucial for downstream tasks such as risk-aware control and reinforcement learning, efficient exploration, and robust policy transfer. While existing approaches like Gaussian Processes, Bayesian networks, and model ensembles are widely adopted, they suffer from either high computational complexity or inaccurate uncertainty estimation. To address these limitations, we propose the Compressed Data Representation Model (CDRM), a framework that learns a neural network encoding of the data distribution and enables direct sampling from the output distribution. Our approach incorporates a novel inference procedure based on Langevin dynamics sampling, allowing CDRM to predict arbitrary output distributions rather than being constrained to a Gaussian prior. Theoretical analysis provides the conditions where CDRM achieves better memory and computational complexity compared to bin-based compression methods. Empirical evaluations show that CDRM demonstrates a superior capability to identify aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties separately, achieving AUROCs of 0.8876 and 0.9981 on a single test set containing a mixture of both uncertainties. Qualitative results further show that CDRM's capability extends to datasets with multimodal output distributions, a challenging scenario where existing methods consistently fail.

This paper explores the convergence of LLM reasoning techniques and feature generation for machine learning tasks. We examine four key reasoning approaches: Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Thought Space Exploration. Our analysis reveals how these approaches can be used to identify effective feature generation rules without having to manually specify search spaces. The paper categorizes LLM-based feature generation methods across various domains including finance, healthcare, and text analytics. LLMs can extract key information from clinical notes and radiology reports in healthcare, by enabling more efficient data utilization. In finance, LLMs facilitate text generation, summarization, and entity extraction from complex documents. We analyze evaluation methodologies for assessing feature quality and downstream performance, with particular attention to OCTree's decision tree reasoning approach that provides language-based feedback for iterative improvements. Current challenges include hallucination, computational efficiency, and domain adaptation. As of March 2025, emerging approaches include inference-time compute scaling, reinforcement learning, and supervised fine-tuning with model distillation. Future directions point toward multimodal feature generation, self-improving systems, and neuro-symbolic approaches.

Recent work (METRA) has effectively argued that moving away from mutual information and instead optimizing a certain Wasserstein distance is important for good performance. In this paper, we argue that the benefits seen in that paper can largely be explained within the existing framework of mutual information skill learning (MISL). Our analysis suggests a new MISL method (contrastive successor features) that retains the excellent performance of METRA with fewer moving parts, and highlights connections between skill learning, contrastive representation learning, and successor features. Finally, through careful ablation studies, we provide further insight into some of the key ingredients for both our method and METRA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and videos are available on the website: https://princeton-rl.github.io/contrastive-successor-features/</p></details> |

While VLFMs show a rich understanding of semantic content across modalities, they often struggle with fine-grained alignment tasks that require precise correspondence between image regions and textual descriptions a limitation in medical imaging, where accurate localization and detection of clinical features are essential for diagnosis and analysis. To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage architecture where a pre-trained VLFM provides a cursory semantic understanding, while a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm refines the alignment through an iterative process that optimizes for understanding semantic context. The reward signal is designed to align the semantic information of the text with synthesized images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a medical imaging skin dataset where the generated images exhibit improved generation quality and alignment with prompt over the fine-tuned Stable Diffusion. We also show that the synthesized samples could be used to improve disease classifier performance for underrepresented subgroups through augmentation.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies have explored generation methods leveraging the contextual understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs); however, accurately reproducing the game features of the game descriptions remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning of LLMs for GDG (RLGDG). Our training method simultaneously improves grammatical correctness and fidelity to game concepts by introducing both grammar rewards and concept rewards. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy where Reinforcement Learning (RL) is applied following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline methods using SFT alone.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we propose a meta-curriculum training scheme. First, meta-training allows the agent to learn a master policy to generalize across tasks. The resulting model is then fine-tuned on the downstream tasks. We organize the training curriculum in a hierarchical manner such that the agent is guided from coarse to fine towards the target task. In addition, we introduce Incremental Self-Adaptive Reinforcement learning (ISAR), an algorithm that combines the ideas of incremental learning and meta-reinforcement learning (MRL). In contrast to traditional reinforcement learning (RL), which focuses on acquiring a policy for a specific task, MRL aims to learn a policy with fast transfer ability to novel tasks. However, the MRL training process is time consuming, whereas our proposed ISAR algorithm achieves faster convergence than the conventional MRL algorithm. We evaluate the proposed methodologies in simulated environments and demonstrate that using this training philosophy in conjunction with the ISAR algorithm significantly improves the convergence speed for navigation in large-scale cities and the adaptation proficiency in novel environments.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, deploying the trained policies in the real world demands a feature-rich environment along with multiple physical embodied agents, which may not be feasible due to monetary, physical, energy, or safety constraints. This work seeks to address these pain points by presenting a mixed-reality digital twin framework capable of: (i) selectively scaling parallelized workloads on-demand, and (ii) evaluating the trained policies across simulation-to-reality (sim2real) experiments. The viability and performance of the proposed framework are highlighted through two representative use cases, which cover cooperative as well as competitive classes of MARL problems. We study the effect of: (i) agent and environment parallelization on training time, and (ii) systematic domain randomization on zero-shot sim2real transfer across both case studies. Results indicate up to 76.3% reduction in training time with the proposed parallelization scheme and sim2real gap as low as 2.9% using the proposed deployment method.</p></details> |  |

We successfully integrated sophisticated language models into the RL framework, enhancing strategic decision-making processes.

| **[Reward Training Wheels: Adaptive Auxiliary Rewards for Robotics Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15724v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotics Reinforcement Learning (RL) often relies on carefully engineered auxiliary rewards to supplement sparse primary learning objectives to compensate for the lack of large-scale, real-world, trial-and-error data. While these auxiliary rewards accelerate learning, they require significant engineering effort, may introduce human biases, and cannot adapt to the robot's evolving capabilities during training. In this paper, we introduce Reward Training Wheels (RTW), a teacher-student framework that automates auxiliary reward adaptation for robotics RL. To be specific, the RTW teacher dynamically adjusts auxiliary reward weights based on the student's evolving capabilities to determine which auxiliary reward aspects require more or less emphasis to improve the primary objective. We demonstrate RTW on two challenging robot tasks: navigation in highly constrained spaces and off-road vehicle mobility on vertically challenging terrain. In simulation, RTW outperforms expert-designed rewards by 2.35% in navigation success rate and improves off-road mobility performance by 122.62%, while achieving 35% and 3X faster training efficiency, respectively. Physical robot experiments further validate RTW's effectiveness, achieving a perfect success rate (5/5 trials vs. 2/5 for expert-designed rewards) and improving vehicle stability with up to 47.4% reduction in orientation angles.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities during inference to use search engines is not optimal, since the LLM does not learn how to optimally interact with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of the DeepSeek-R1 model where the LLM learns -- solely through reinforcement learning (RL) -- to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM rollouts with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 26% (Qwen2.5-7B), 21% (Qwen2.5-3B), and 10% (LLaMA3.2-3B) over strong baselines. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

| **[Predicting Multi-Agent Specialization via Task Parallelizability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15703v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems often rely on specialized agents with distinct roles rather than general-purpose agents that perform the entire task independently. However, the conditions that govern the optimal degree of specialization remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose that specialist teams outperform generalist ones when environmental constraints limit task parallelizability -- the potential to execute task components concurrently. Drawing inspiration from distributed systems, we introduce a heuristic to predict the relative efficiency of generalist versus specialist teams by estimating the speed-up achieved when two agents perform a task in parallel rather than focus on complementary subtasks. We validate this heuristic through three multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) experiments in Overcooked-AI, demonstrating that key factors limiting task parallelizability influence specialization. We also observe that as the state space expands, agents tend to converge on specialist strategies, even when generalist ones are theoretically more efficient, highlighting potential biases in MARL training algorithms. Our findings provide a principled framework for interpreting specialization given the task and environment, and introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating whether MARL finds optimal strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Good Actions Succeed, Bad Actions Generalize: A Case Study on Why RL Generalizes Better](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15693v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) are both widely used to train general-purpose agents for complex tasks, yet their generalization capabilities and underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we provide a direct comparison between SL and RL in terms of zero-shot generalization. Using the Habitat visual navigation task as a testbed, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Behavior Cloning (BC) agents across two levels of generalization: state-goal pair generalization within seen environments and generalization to unseen environments. Our experiments show that PPO consistently outperforms BC across both zero-shot settings and performance metrics-success rate and SPL. Interestingly, even though additional optimal training data enables BC to match PPO's zero-shot performance in SPL, it still falls significantly behind in success rate. We attribute this to a fundamental difference in how models trained by these algorithms generalize: BC-trained models generalize by imitating successful trajectories, whereas TD-based RL-trained models generalize through combinatorial experience stitching-leveraging fragments of past trajectories (mostly failed ones) to construct solutions for new tasks. This allows RL to efficiently find solutions in vast state space and discover novel strategies beyond the scope of human knowledge. Besides providing empirical evidence and understanding, we also propose practical guidelines for improving the generalization capabilities of RL and SL through algorithm design.</p></details> |  |

Medical reasoning tasks demand robust image analysis and well-justified answers, posing challenges due to the complexity of medical images. Transparency and trustworthiness are essential for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance. We introduce Med-R1, a framework exploring reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance VLMs' generalizability and trustworthiness in medical reasoning. Leveraging the DeepSeek strategy, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to guide reasoning paths via reward signals. Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often overfits and lacks generalization, RL fosters robust and diverse reasoning. Med-R1 is evaluated across eight medical imaging modalities: CT, MRI, Ultrasound, Dermoscopy, Fundus Photography, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Microscopy, and X-ray Imaging. Compared to its base model, Qwen2-VL-2B, Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% accuracy improvement and outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B, which has 36 times more parameters. Testing across five question types-modality recognition, anatomy identification, disease diagnosis, lesion grading, and biological attribute analysis Med-R1 demonstrates superior generalization, exceeding Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% and surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B in question-type generalization. These findings show that RL improves medical reasoning and enables parameter-efficient models to outperform significantly larger ones. With interpretable reasoning outputs, Med-R1 represents a promising step toward generalizable, trustworthy, and clinically viable medical VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robotic Paper Wrapping by Learning Force Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15685v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic packaging using wrapping paper poses significant challenges due to the material's complex deformation properties. The packaging process itself involves multiple steps, primarily categorized as folding the paper or creating creases. Small deviations in the robot's arm trajectory or force vector can lead to tearing or wrinkling of the paper, exacerbated by the variability in material properties. This study introduces a novel framework that combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning to enable a robot to perform each step of the packaging process efficiently. The framework allows the robot to follow approximate trajectories of the tool-center point (TCP) based on human demonstrations while optimizing force control parameters to prevent tearing or wrinkling, even with variable wrapping paper materials. The proposed method was validated through ablation studies, which demonstrated successful task completion with a significant reduction in tear and wrinkle rates. Furthermore, the force control strategy proved to be adaptable across different wrapping paper materials and robust against variations in the size of the target object.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel, sample-efficient method for neural approximation of nonlinear Lyapunov functions, leveraging self-supervised Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance training data generation, particularly for inaccurately represented regions of the state space. The proposed approach employs a data-driven World Model to train Lyapunov functions from off-policy trajectories. The method is validated on both standard and goal-conditioned robotic tasks, demonstrating faster convergence and higher approximation accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art neural Lyapunov approximation baseline.

However, real-world environments often exhibit inherent asymmetries arising from factors such as external forces, measurement inaccuracies, or intrinsic system biases. This paper introduces \textit{Partially Equivariant Graph NeUral Networks (PEnGUiN)}, a novel architecture specifically designed to address these challenges. We formally identify and categorize various types of partial equivariance relevant to MARL, including subgroup equivariance, feature-wise equivariance, regional equivariance, and approximate equivariance. We theoretically demonstrate that PEnGUiN is capable of learning both fully equivariant (EGNN) and non-equivariant (GNN) representations within a unified framework. Through extensive experiments on a range of MARL problems incorporating various asymmetries, we empirically validate the efficacy of PEnGUiN. Our results consistently demonstrate that PEnGUiN outperforms both EGNNs and standard GNNs in asymmetric environments, highlighting their potential to improve the robustness and applicability of graph-based MARL algorithms in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Over the years, several works demonstrated hand-designed controllers on real world piano playing, while other works evaluated robot learning approaches on simulated piano scenarios. In this paper, we develop the first piano playing robotic system that makes use of learning approaches while also being deployed on a real world dexterous robot. Specifically, we make use of Sim2Real to train a policy in simulation using reinforcement learning before deploying the learned policy on a real world dexterous robot. In our experiments, we thoroughly evaluate the interplay between domain randomization and the accuracy of the dynamics model used in simulation. Moreover, we evaluate the robot's performance across multiple songs with varying complexity to study the generalization of our learned policy. By providing a proof-of-concept of learning to play piano in the real world, we want to encourage the community to adopt piano playing as a compelling benchmark towards human-level manipulation. We open-source our code and show additional videos at https://lasr.org/research/learning-to-play-piano .</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[What Makes a Reward Model a Good Teacher? An Optimization Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15477v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) critically depends on the quality of the reward model. While this quality is primarily evaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures what makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from an optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a reward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective suffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward model can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate models that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward model that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance, and thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a fundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or independently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up to 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between reward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings highlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient variance for efficient optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/princeton-pli/what-makes-good-rm</p></details> |

Conventional approaches, such as real-world test drives, are not only expensive but also lack the flexibility to capture targeted edge cases for thorough evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a controllable latent diffusion that guides the training of diffusion models via reinforcement learning to automatically generate a diverse and controllable set of driving scenarios for virtual testing. Our approach removes the reliance on large-scale real-world data by generating complex scenarios whose properties can be finely tuned to challenge and assess autonomous vehicle systems. Experimental results show that our approach has the lowest collision rate of $0.098$ and lowest off-road rate of $0.096$, demonstrating superiority over existing baselines. The proposed approach significantly improves the realism, stability and controllability of the generated scenarios, enabling more nuanced safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages,2 figures, submitted to IROS conference</p></details> |
| **[A Role of Environmental Complexity on Representation Learning in Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03436v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We developed a simulated environment to train deep reinforcement learning agents on a shortcut usage navigation task, motivated by the Dual Solutions Paradigm test used for human navigators. We manipulated the frequency with which agents were exposed to a shortcut and a navigation cue, to investigate how these factors influence shortcut usage development. We find that all agents rapidly achieve optimal performance in closed shortcut trials once initial learning starts. However, their navigation speed and shortcut usage when it is open happen faster in agents with higher shortcut exposure. Analysis of the agents' artificial neural networks activity revealed that frequent presentation of a cue initially resulted in better encoding of the cue in the activity of individual nodes, compared to agents who encountered the cue less often. However, stronger cue representations were ultimately formed through the use of the cue in the context of navigation planning, rather than simply through exposure. We found that in all agents, spatial representations develop early in training and subsequently stabilize before navigation strategies fully develop, suggesting that having spatially consistent activations is necessary for basic navigation, but insufficient for advanced strategies. Further, using new analysis techniques, we found that the planned trajectory rather than the agent's immediate location is encoded in the agent's networks. Moreover, the encoding is represented at the population rather than the individual node level. These techniques could have broader applications in studying neural activity across populations of neurons or network nodes beyond individual activity patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, the audio modality has largely been overlooked in these developments. Thus, we conduct a series of RL explorations in audio understanding and reasoning, specifically focusing on the audio question answering (AQA) task. We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, and our experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the MMAU Test-mini benchmark, achieving an accuracy rate of 64.5%. The main findings in this technical report are as follows: 1) The GRPO algorithm can be effectively applied to large audio language models (LALMs), even when the model has only 8.2B parameters; 2) With only 38k post-training samples, RL significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), indicating that RL-based approaches can be effective without large datasets; 3) The explicit reasoning process has not shown significant benefits for AQA tasks, and how to efficiently utilize deep thinking remains an open question for further research; 4) LALMs still lag far behind humans auditory-language reasoning, suggesting that the RL-based approaches warrant further exploration.

The goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a framework to study market fairness and regulation in both digitized and non-digitized public procurement processes, amid growing concerns about algorithmic collusion in online markets. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning-driven artificial agents, we demonstrate that (i) the MPMG is a reliable model for first-price market dynamics, (ii) the minimum price rule is generally resilient to non-engineered tacit coordination among rational actors, and (iii) when tacit coordination occurs, it relies heavily on self-reinforcing trends. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate about algorithmic pricing and its implications.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the investigation of quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandit problems was started, and it was found that a quadratic speed-up (in query complexity) is possible when the arms and the randomness of the rewards of the arms can be queried in superposition. Here we introduce further bandit models where we only have limited access to the randomness of the rewards, but we can still query the arms in superposition. We show that then the query complexity is the same as for classical algorithms. This generalizes the prior result that no speed-up is possible for unstructured search when the oracle has positive failure probability.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, accepted in Quantum</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Decomposition for Optimal Claim Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15354v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research on the \textit{Decompose-Then-Verify} paradigm for evaluating the factuality of long-form text typically treats decomposition and verification in isolation, overlooking their interactions and potential misalignment. We find that existing decomposition policies, typically hand-crafted demonstrations, do not align well with downstream verifiers in terms of atomicity -- a novel metric quantifying information density -- leading to suboptimal verification results. We formulate finding the optimal decomposition policy for optimal verification as a bilevel optimization problem. To approximate a solution for this strongly NP-hard problem, we propose dynamic decomposition, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifier feedback to learn a policy for dynamically decomposing claims to verifier-preferred atomicity. Experimental results show that dynamic decomposition outperforms existing decomposition policies, improving verification confidence by 0.07 and accuracy by 0.12 (on a 0-1 scale) on average across varying verifiers, datasets, and atomcities of input claims.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Step Reward Models for Enhanced Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13551v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. However, a key approach, the Process Reward Model (PRM), suffers from reward hacking, making it unreliable in identifying the best intermediate steps. In this paper, we propose a novel reward model approach, Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM), which evaluates both individual and consecutive reasoning steps from fine-grained and coarse-grained level. HRM performs better in assessing reasoning coherence and self-reflection, particularly when the previous reasoning step is incorrect. Furthermore, to address the inefficiency of autonomous generating PRM training data via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we introduce a lightweight and effective data augmentation strategy called Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC) based on node merging (combining two consecutive reasoning steps into one step) in the tree structure. This approach diversifies MCTS results for HRM with negligible computational overhead, enhancing label robustness by introducing noise. Empirical results on the PRM800K dataset demonstrate that HRM, in conjunction with HNC, achieves superior stability and reliability in evaluation compared to PRM. Furthermore, cross-domain evaluations on MATH500 and GSM8K confirm HRM's superior generalization and robustness across diverse reasoning tasks. The code for all experiments will be released at https: //github.com/tengwang0318/hierarchial_reward_model.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLM: Efficient Peripheral Language Models Hardware-Co-Designed for Ubiquitous Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12167v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While scaling laws have been continuously validated in large language models (LLMs) with increasing model parameters, the inherent tension between the inference demands of LLMs and the limited resources of edge devices poses a critical challenge to the development of edge intelligence. Recently, numerous small language models have emerged, aiming to distill the capabilities of LLMs into smaller footprints. However, these models often retain the fundamental architectural principles of their larger counterparts, still imposing considerable strain on the storage and bandwidth capacities of edge devices. In this paper, we introduce the PLM, a Peripheral Language Model, developed through a co-design process that jointly optimizes model architecture and edge system constraints. The PLM utilizes a Multi-head Latent Attention mechanism and employs the squared ReLU activation function to encourage sparsity, thereby reducing peak memory footprint during inference. During training, we collect and reorganize open-source datasets, implement a multi-phase training strategy, and empirically investigate the Warmup-Stable-Decay-Constant (WSDC) learning rate scheduler. Additionally, we incorporate Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) by adopting the ARIES preference learning approach. Following a two-phase SFT process, this method yields performance gains of 2% in general tasks, 9% in the GSM8K task, and 11% in coding tasks. In addition to its novel architecture, evaluation results demonstrate that PLM outperforms existing small language models trained on publicly available data while maintaining the lowest number of activated parameters. Furthermore, deployment across various edge devices, including consumer-grade GPUs, mobile phones, and Raspberry Pis, validates PLM's suitability for peripheral applications. The PLM series models are publicly available at https://github.com/plm-team/PLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[aiXcoder-7B-v2: Training LLMs to Fully Utilize the Long Context in Repository-level Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15301v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level code completion aims to complete code based on the long contexts of the repository. Existing studies extract long contexts from the repository as inputs and leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. However, we reveal a severe limitation of LLMs, i.e., LLMs may ignore the information within long contexts in code completion. In other words, even the contexts contain useful information (e.g., relevant APIs or similar code), LLMs may fail to utilize this information. We think this limitation is caused by an inherent bias in LLMs, i.e., relying on nearby contexts and ignoring long-range contexts. To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach named CoLT. The core idea of CoLT is to provide explicit supervision signals, which emphasize that long-range contexts may hold relevant information. Specifically, CoLT proposes a reinforcement learning-based training, which explicitly encourages models to utilize the information within long contexts and punishes models for ignoring long contexts. To support CoLT, we release CoLT-132K, a large-scale dataset with 132k samples across four languages, each containing long-context inputs. We apply CoLT to a popular LLM - aiXcoder-7B and release aiXcoder-7B-v2. We conduct extensive experiments on CoLT-132K and a public benchmark - CrossCodeEval. Our experiments yield the results: 1. Effectiveness. CoLT substantially improves aiXcoder-7B. aiXcoder-7B-v2 outperforms aiXcoder-7B by up to 44% in exact match. aiXcoder-7B-v2 becomes the state-of-the-art 7B model in code completion and even surpasses larger models. 2. Generalizability. The capability learned by CoLT can generalize to new languages. Besides, CoLT is model-agnostic and effectively improves multiple LLMs. 3. Enhanced Context Utilization Capability. CoLT significantly improves the capability of LLMs in utilizing the relevant information within long contexts.</p></details> |  |

Deep Reinforcement Learning has been used extensively in these settings, as it does not have the unsustainable training costs associated with supervised learning. However, DeepRL suffers from poor sample efficiency, i.e., it requires a large number of environmental interactions to converge to an acceptable solution. Modern RL algorithms such as Deep Q Learning and Soft Actor-Critic attempt to remedy this shortcoming but can not provide the explainability required in applications such as autonomous robotics. Humans intuitively understand the long-time-horizon sequential tasks common in robotics. Properly using such intuition can make RL policies more explainable while enhancing their sample efficiency. In this work, we propose SHIRE, a novel framework for encoding human intuition using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and using it in the Deep RL training pipeline to enhance sample efficiency. Our framework achieves 25-78% sample efficiency gains across the environments we evaluate at negligible overhead cost. Additionally, by teaching RL agents the encoded elementary behavior, SHIRE enhances policy explainability. A real-world demonstration further highlights the efficacy of policies trained using our framework.</p></details> |  |

Bioelectric signals, defined as voltage gradients across cell membranes caused by ionic movements, play a role in regulating crucial processes including cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis. Recent studies demonstrate the ability to modulate these signals to achieve controlled tissue regeneration and morphological outcomes in organisms such as planaria and frogs. However, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly in predicting and controlling the spatial and temporal dynamics of membrane potentials (V_mem), understanding their regulatory roles in tissue and organ development, and exploring their therapeutic potential in diseases. In this work we propose an experiment using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework together with lab automation techniques for real-time manipulation of bioelectric signals to guide tissue regeneration and morphogenesis. The proposed framework should interact continuously with biological systems, adapting strategies based on direct biological feedback. Combining DRL with real-time measurement techniques -- such as optogenetics, voltage-sensitive dyes, fluorescent reporters, and advanced microscopy -- could provide a comprehensive platform for precise bioelectric control, leading to improved understanding of bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis, quantitative bioelectric models, identification of minimal experimental setups, and advancements in bioelectric modulation techniques relevant to regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. Ultimately, this research aims to utilize bioelectric signaling to develop new biomedical and bioengineering applications.</p></details> |  |

While auto-regressive methods generate structured meshes by predicting discrete vertex tokens, they are often constrained by limited face counts and mesh incompleteness. To address these challenges, we propose DeepMesh, a framework that optimizes mesh generation through two key innovations: (1) an efficient pre-training strategy incorporating a novel tokenization algorithm, along with improvements in data curation and processing, and (2) the introduction of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into 3D mesh generation to achieve human preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We design a scoring standard that combines human evaluation with 3D metrics to collect preference pairs for DPO, ensuring both visual appeal and geometric accuracy.

Tapered Off-Policy REINFORCE (TOPR) uses an asymmetric, tapered variant of importance sampling to speed up learning while maintaining stable learning dynamics, even without the use of KL regularization. TOPR can be applied in a fully offline fashion, allows the handling of positive and negative examples in a unified framework, and benefits from the implementational simplicity that is typical of Monte Carlo algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a series of experiments on the GSM8K and MATH reasoning benchmarks, finding performance gains for training both a model for solution generation and as a generative verifier. We show that properly leveraging positive and negative examples alike in the off-policy regime simultaneously increases test-time accuracy and training data efficiency, all the while avoiding the ``wasted inference'' that comes with discarding negative examples. We find that this advantage persists over multiple iterations of training and can be amplified by dataset curation techniques, enabling us to match 70B-parameter model performance with 8B language models. As a corollary to this work, we find that REINFORCE's baseline parameter plays an important and unexpected role in defining dataset composition in the presence of negative examples, and is consequently critical in driving off-policy performance.</p></details> |  |

Although Medical Visual Language Models (VLMs) show promise for radiological tasks, most existing VLMs merely produce final answers without revealing the underlying reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce MedVLM-R1, a medical VLM that explicitly generates natural language reasoning to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Instead of relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often suffers from overfitting to training distributions and fails to foster genuine reasoning, MedVLM-R1 employs a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the model to discover human-interpretable reasoning paths without using any reasoning references. Despite limited training data (600 visual question answering samples) and model parameters (2B), MedVLM-R1 boosts accuracy from 55.11% to 78.22% across MRI, CT, and X-ray benchmarks, outperforming larger models trained on over a million samples. It also demonstrates robust domain generalization under out-of-distribution tasks. By unifying medical image analysis with explicit reasoning, MedVLM-R1 marks a pivotal step toward trustworthy and interpretable AI in clinical practice.

Strategies such as motion washout, which return the platform to its center, are crucial in these settings. For serial robotic MSPs with highly nonlinear workspaces, it is essential to maximize the efficient utilization of the MSPs kinematic and dynamic capabilities. Traditional approaches, including classical washout filtering and linear model predictive control, fail to consider platform-specific, nonlinear properties, while nonlinear model predictive control, though comprehensive, imposes high computational demands that hinder real-time, pilot-in-the-loop application without further simplification. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning for motion cueing, demonstrated here for the first time in a 6-degree-of-freedom setting with full consideration of the MSPs kinematic nonlinearities. Previous work by the authors successfully demonstrated the application of DRL to a simplified 2-DOF setup, which did not consider kinematic or dynamic constraints. This approach has been extended to all 6 DOF by incorporating a complete kinematic model of the MSP into the algorithm, a crucial step for enabling its application on a real motion simulator. The training of the DRL-MCA is based on Proximal Policy Optimization in an actor-critic implementation combined with an automated hyperparameter optimization.

| **[A Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Motion Cueing Algorithm for Vehicle Driving Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07600v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion cueing algorithms (MCA) are used to control the movement of motion simulation platforms (MSP) to reproduce the motion perception of a real vehicle driver as accurately as possible without exceeding the limits of the workspace of the MSP. Existing approaches either produce non-optimal results due to filtering, linearization, or simplifications, or the computational time required exceeds the real-time requirements of a closed-loop application. This work presents a new solution to the motion cueing problem, where instead of a human designer specifying the principles of the MCA, an artificial intelligence (AI) learns the optimal motion by trial and error in interaction with the MSP. To achieve this, a well-established deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is applied, where an agent interacts with an environment, allowing him to directly control a simulated MSP to obtain feedback on its performance. The RL algorithm used is proximal policy optimization (PPO), where the value function and the policy corresponding to the control strategy are both learned and mapped in artificial neural networks (ANN). This approach is implemented in Python and the functionality is demonstrated by the practical example of pre-recorded lateral maneuvers. The subsequent validation shows that the RL algorithm is able to learn the control strategy and improve the quality of the immersion compared to an established method. Thereby, the perceived motion signals determined by a model of the vestibular system are more accurately reproduced, and the resources of the MSP are used more economically.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning on One Mode: Addressing Multi-modality in Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03258v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to learn optimal policies from static datasets without interacting with the environment. A common challenge is handling multi-modal action distributions, where multiple behaviours are represented in the data. Existing methods often assume unimodal behaviour policies, leading to suboptimal performance when this assumption is violated. We propose weighted imitation Learning on One Mode (LOM), a novel approach that focuses on learning from a single, promising mode of the behaviour policy. By using a Gaussian mixture model to identify modes and selecting the best mode based on expected returns, LOM avoids the pitfalls of averaging over conflicting actions. Theoretically, we show that LOM improves performance while maintaining simplicity in policy learning. Empirically, LOM outperforms existing methods on standard D4RL benchmarks and demonstrates its effectiveness in complex, multi-modal scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning with Memory Traces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15200v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially observable environments present a considerable computational challenge in reinforcement learning due to the need to consider long histories. Learning with a finite window of observations quickly becomes intractable as the window length grows. In this work, we introduce memory traces. Inspired by eligibility traces, these are compact representations of the history of observations in the form of exponential moving averages. We prove sample complexity bounds for the problem of offline on-policy evaluation that quantify the value errors achieved with memory traces for the class of Lipschitz continuous value estimates. We establish a close connection to the window approach, and demonstrate that, in certain environments, learning with memory traces is significantly more sample efficient. Finally, we underline the effectiveness of memory traces empirically in online reinforcement learning experiments for both value prediction and control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent cooperation through learning-aware policy gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18636v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-interested individuals often fail to cooperate, posing a fundamental challenge for multi-agent learning. How can we achieve cooperation among self-interested, independent learning agents? Promising recent work has shown that in certain tasks cooperation can be established between learning-aware agents who model the learning dynamics of each other. Here, we present the first unbiased, higher-derivative-free policy gradient algorithm for learning-aware reinforcement learning, which takes into account that other agents are themselves learning through trial and error based on multiple noisy trials. We then leverage efficient sequence models to condition behavior on long observation histories that contain traces of the learning dynamics of other agents. Training long-context policies with our algorithm leads to cooperative behavior and high returns on standard social dilemmas, including a challenging environment where temporally-extended action coordination is required. Finally, we derive from the iterated prisoner's dilemma a novel explanation for how and when cooperation arises among self-interested learning-aware agents.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to their high computational cost. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present a novel sparse recurrent MARL framework integrating gradual neural network pruning into the independent actor global critic paradigm. Additionally, we introduce a harmonic annealing sparsity scheduler, which achieves comparable, and in certain cases superior, performance to standard linear and polynomial pruning schedulers at large sparsities. Our experimental investigation demonstrates that the proposed DSA framework can discover superior policies, under diverse training conditions, outperforming conventional DSA, MADRL baselines, and state-of-the-art pruning techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, submited to an IEEE conference</p></details> |

This paper presents an approach for inferring suitable grasping strategies from limited partial views of an object. To achieve this, a recurrent generative adversarial network (R-GAN) was proposed by incorporating a recurrent generator with long short-term memory (LSTM) units for it to process a variable number of depth scans. To determine object affordances, the AffordPose knowledge dataset is utilized as prior knowledge. Affordance retrieving is defined by the volume similarity measured via Chamfer Distance and action similarities. A Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning model is further implemented to refine the retrieved grasp strategies for task-oriented grasping. The retrieved grasp strategies were evaluated on a dual-arm mobile manipulation robot with an overall grasping accuracy of 89% for four tasks: lift, handle grasp, wrap grasp, and press.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we demonstrate that our Bayesian optimization framework supports AI alignment in code generation by distributing the feedback collection burden, highlighting the value of collecting human feedback of good quality. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, showcasing how LLM agents can be effectively trained for improved text-to-code generation. Our Bayesian optimization framework can be designed for general domain-specific languages, promoting the alignment of large language model capabilities with human feedback in AI-assisted programming for code generation.</p></details> |  |

A critical challenge in this domain is the accurate modeling of human motion, which directly impacts the design and evaluation of navigation algorithms. This paper presents a comparative study of two popular categories of human motion models used in social robot navigation, namely velocity-based models and force-based models. A system-theoretic representation of both model types is presented, which highlights their common feedback structure, although with different state variables. Several navigation policies based on reinforcement learning are trained and tested in various simulated environments involving pedestrian crowds modeled with these approaches. A comparative study is conducted to assess performance across multiple factors, including human motion model, navigation policy, scenario complexity and crowd density. The results highlight advantages and challenges of different approaches to modeling human behavior, as well as their role during training and testing of learning-based navigation policies. The findings offer valuable insights and guidelines for selecting appropriate human motion models when designing socially-aware robot navigation systems.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce VIPER, a novel framework for multimodal instruction-based planning that integrates VLM-based perception with LLM-based reasoning. Our approach uses a modular pipeline where a frozen VLM generates textual descriptions of image observations, which are then processed by an LLM policy to predict actions based on the task goal. We fine-tune the reasoning module using behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning, improving our agent's decision-making capabilities. Experiments on the ALFWorld benchmark show that VIPER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visual instruction-based planners while narrowing the gap with purely text-based oracles. By leveraging text as an intermediate representation, VIPER also enhances explainability, paving the way for a fine-grained analysis of perception and reasoning components.</p></details> |  |

In our approach, a diffusion-based time series forecasting model is used to probabilistically estimate the evolution of the system's stochastic components. These forecasts are then incorporated into MPC algorithms to estimate future trajectories and optimize action selection under the uncertainty of the future. We evaluate the framework on the task of energy arbitrage, where a Battery Energy Storage System participates in the day-ahead electricity market of the New York state. Experimental results indicate that our model-based approach with a diffusion-based forecaster significantly outperforms both implementations with classical forecasting methods and model-free reinforcement learning baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Long-horizon Locomotion and Manipulation on a Quadrupedal Robot with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05291v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a large language model (LLM) based system to empower quadrupedal robots with problem-solving abilities for long-horizon tasks beyond short-term motions. Long-horizon tasks for quadrupeds are challenging since they require both a high-level understanding of the semantics of the problem for task planning and a broad range of locomotion and manipulation skills to interact with the environment. Our system builds a high-level reasoning layer with large language models, which generates hybrid discrete-continuous plans as robot code from task descriptions. It comprises multiple LLM agents: a semantic planner that sketches a plan, a parameter calculator that predicts arguments in the plan, a code generator that converts the plan into executable robot code, and a replanner that handles execution failures or human interventions. At the low level, we adopt reinforcement learning to train a set of motion planning and control skills to unleash the flexibility of quadrupeds for rich environment interactions. Our system is tested on long-horizon tasks that are infeasible to complete with one single skill. Simulation and real-world experiments show that it successfully figures out multi-step strategies and demonstrates non-trivial behaviors, including building tools or notifying a human for help. Demos are available on our project page: https://sites.google.com/view/long-horizon-robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[StyleLoco: Generative Adversarial Distillation for Natural Humanoid Robot Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15082v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots are anticipated to acquire a wide range of locomotion capabilities while ensuring natural movement across varying speeds and terrains. Existing methods encounter a fundamental dilemma in learning humanoid locomotion: reinforcement learning with handcrafted rewards can achieve agile locomotion but produces unnatural gaits, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) with motion capture data yields natural movements but suffers from unstable training processes and restricted agility. Integrating these approaches proves challenging due to the inherent heterogeneity between expert policies and human motion datasets. To address this, we introduce StyleLoco, a novel two-stage framework that bridges this gap through a Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD) process. Our framework begins by training a teacher policy using reinforcement learning to achieve agile and dynamic locomotion. It then employs a multi-discriminator architecture, where distinct discriminators concurrently extract skills from both the teacher policy and motion capture data. This approach effectively combines the agility of reinforcement learning with the natural fluidity of human-like movements while mitigating the instability issues commonly associated with adversarial training. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that StyleLoco enables humanoid robots to perform diverse locomotion tasks with the precision of expertly trained policies and the natural aesthetics of human motion, successfully transferring styles across different movement types while maintaining stable locomotion across a broad spectrum of command inputs.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

However, their potential in the decision-making domain, particularly in model-based reinforcement learning, remains underexplored. The difficulty lies in the need for spiking neurons with long-term temporal memory capabilities, as well as network optimization that can integrate and learn information for accurate predictions. The dynamic dendritic information integration mechanism of biological neurons brings us valuable insights for addressing these challenges. In this study, we propose a multi-compartment neuron model capable of nonlinearly integrating information from multiple dendritic sources to dynamically process long sequential inputs. Based on this model, we construct a Spiking World Model (Spiking-WM), to enable model-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with SNNs. We evaluated our model using the DeepMind Control Suite, demonstrating that Spiking-WM outperforms existing SNN-based models and achieves performance comparable to artificial neural network (ANN)-based world models employing Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Furthermore, we assess the long-term memory capabilities of the proposed model in speech datasets, including SHD, TIMIT, and LibriSpeech 100h, showing that our multi-compartment neuron model surpasses other SNN-based architectures in processing long sequences. Our findings underscore the critical role of dendritic information integration in shaping neuronal function, emphasizing the importance of cooperative dendritic processing in enhancing neural computation.</p></details> |  |

However, contemporary methodologies, such as deterministic and imitation learning-based driver models, struggle to capture the variability of human-like driving behavior. Given these challenges, we propose HAD-Gen, a general framework for realistic traffic scenario generation that simulates diverse human-like driving behaviors. The framework first clusters the vehicle trajectory data into different driving styles according to safety features. It then employs maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning on each of the clusters to learn the reward function corresponding to each driving style. Using these reward functions, the method integrates offline reinforcement learning pre-training and multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms to obtain general and robust driving policies. Multi-perspective simulation results show that our proposed scenario generation framework can simulate diverse, human-like driving behaviors with strong generalization capability. The proposed framework achieves a 90.96% goal-reaching rate, an off-road rate of 2.08%, and a collision rate of 6.91% in the generalization test, outperforming prior approaches by over 20% in goal-reaching performance.

However, finding the initial stabilizing control depends on the known system model. To relax this requirement and achieve model-free optimal control, in this paper, two different reinforcement learning algorithms based on policy iteration and variable damping coefficients are designed for unknown discrete-time linear systems. First, a stable artificial system is designed, and this system is gradually iterated to the original system by varying the damping coefficients. This allows the initial stabilizing control to be obtained in a finite number of iteration steps. Then, an off-policy iteration algorithm and an off-policy $\mathcal{Q}$-learning algorithm are designed to select the appropriate damping coefficients and realize data-driven. In these two algorithms, the current estimates of optimal control gain are not applied to the system to re-collect data. Moreover, they are characterized by the fast convergence of the traditional policy iteration. Finally, the proposed algorithms are validated by simulation.</p></details> |  |

To improve deep reinforcement learning, the Least Squares Deep Q Network (LS-DQN) method was proposed by Levine et al., which combines Deep Q Network (DQN) with LR method. However, the LS-DQN method assumes that the actions are discrete. In this study, we propose the Double Least Squares Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DLS-DDPG) method to address this limitation. This method combines the LR method with the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) technique, one of the representative deep reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous action cases. Numerical experiments conducted in MuJoCo environments showed that the LR update improved performance at least in some tasks, although there are difficulties such as the inability to make the regularization terms small.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |

Traditional approaches to explainability often rely on saliency analysis, which can be limited in providing actionable insights. Recently, there has been growing interest in attributing RL decisions to specific trajectories within a dataset. However, these methods often generalize explanations to long trajectories, potentially involving multiple distinct behaviors. Often, providing multiple more fine grained explanations would improve clarity. In this work, we propose a framework for behavior discovery and action attribution to behaviors in offline RL trajectories. Our method identifies meaningful behavioral segments, enabling more precise and granular explanations associated with high level agent behaviors. This approach is adaptable across diverse environments with minimal modifications, offering a scalable and versatile solution for behavior discovery and attribution for explainable RL.</p></details> |  |

Visual sensors like depth cameras enhance stability and robustness but face limitations, such as low operating frequencies relative to joint control and sensitivity to lighting, which hinder outdoor deployment. Additionally, deep neural networks in sensor and control systems increase computational demands. To address these issues, we introduce spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event cameras to perform a challenging quadruped parkour task. Event cameras capture dynamic visual data, while SNNs efficiently process spike sequences, mimicking biological perception. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms traditional models, achieving excellent parkour performance with just 11.7% of the energy consumption of an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model, yielding an 88.3% energy reduction. By integrating event cameras with SNNs, our work advances robotic reinforcement learning and opens new possibilities for applications in demanding environments.</p></details> |  |

We propose a semi-gradient, on-policy algorithm that learns an approximate optimal routing policy. The algorithm uses generic basis functions with flexible weights to approximate the value function across the unbounded state space. Consequently, the training process lacks Lipschitz continuity of the gradient, boundedness of the temporal-difference error, and a prior guarantee on ergodicity, which are the standard prerequisites in existing literature on reinforcement learning theory. To address this, we combine a Lyapunov approach and an ordinary differential equation-based method to jointly characterize the behavior of traffic state and approximation weights. Our theoretical analysis proves that the training scheme guarantees traffic state stability and ensures almost surely convergence of the weights to the approximate optimum. We also demonstrate via simulations that our algorithm attains significantly faster convergence than neural network-based methods with an insignificant approximation error.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.09188</p></details> |

At its core, PRISM adopts a 3D Point Cloud-Language Model (3D-PC-LLM) to mitigate occlusion and viewpoint biases, ensuring more stable and spatially consistent preference signals. Additionally, PRISM leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to incorporate long-horizon considerations, thereby preventing the short-sighted feedback often seen in static preference comparisons. In contrast to conventional PBRL techniques, this integration of 3D perception and future-oriented reasoning leads to significant gains in preference agreement rates, faster policy convergence, and robust generalization across unseen robotic environments. Our empirical results, spanning tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation, highlight PRISM's potential for real-world applications where precise spatial understanding and reliable long-term decision-making are critical.

However, classic RMAB models largely overlook the challenges of (systematic) data errors - a common occurrence in real-world scenarios due to factors like varying data collection protocols and intentional noise for differential privacy. We demonstrate that conventional RL algorithms used to train RMABs can struggle to perform well in such settings. To solve this problem, we propose the first communication learning approach in RMABs, where we study which arms, when involved in communication, are most effective in mitigating the influence of such systematic data errors. In our setup, the arms receive Q-function parameters from similar arms as messages to guide behavioral policies, steering Q-function updates. We learn communication strategies by considering the joint utility of messages across all pairs of arms and using a Q-network architecture that decomposes the joint utility. Both theoretical and empirical evidence validate the effectiveness of our method in significantly improving RMAB performance across diverse problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent Approach to Fault Localization via Graph-Based Retrieval and Reflexion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13642v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying and resolving software faults remains a challenging and resource-intensive process. Traditional fault localization techniques, such as Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL), leverage statistical analysis of test coverage but often suffer from limited accuracy. While learning-based approaches improve fault localization, they demand extensive training datasets and high computational resources. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities by enhancing code understanding and reasoning. However, existing LLM-based fault localization techniques face significant challenges, including token limitations, performance degradation with long inputs, and scalability issues in complex software systems. To overcome these obstacles, we propose LLM4FL, a multi-agent fault localization framework that utilizes three specialized LLM agents. First, the Context Extraction Agent applies an order-sensitive segmentation strategy to partition large coverage data within the LLM's token limit, analyze failure context, and prioritize failure-related methods. The Debugger Agent then processes the extracted data, which employs graph-based retrieval-augmented code navigation to reason about failure causes and rank suspicious methods. Finally, the Reviewer Agent re-evaluates the identified faulty methods using verbal reinforcement learning, engaging in self-criticism and iterative refinement. Evaluated on the Defects4J (V2.0.0) benchmark, which includes 675 faults from 14 Java projects, LLM4FL achieves an 18.55\% improvement in Top-1 accuracy over AutoFL and 4.82\% over SoapFL. It outperforms supervised techniques such as DeepFL and Grace, all without requiring task-specific training. Furthermore, its coverage segmentation and prompt chaining strategies enhance performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by up to 22\%.</p></details> |  |

Using the input-state trajectories of an expert agent, the proposed algorithms separately utilize control policy information and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation to estimate different sets of cost function parameters. This approach allows the algorithms to achieve broader applicability while maintaining a model-free framework. Also, the model-free algorithm reduces complexity compared to existing methods, as it requires solving a forward optimal control problem only once during initialization. Furthermore, in our partially model-free algorithm, this step can be bypassed entirely for systems with known input dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms, highlighting their potential for real-world deployment in autonomous systems and robotics.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study building blocks for self-supervised RL that unlock substantial improvements in scalability, with network depth serving as a critical factor. Whereas most RL papers in recent years have relied on shallow architectures (around 2 - 5 layers), we demonstrate that increasing the depth up to 1024 layers can significantly boost performance. Our experiments are conducted in an unsupervised goal-conditioned setting, where no demonstrations or rewards are provided, so an agent must explore (from scratch) and learn how to maximize the likelihood of reaching commanded goals. Evaluated on simulated locomotion and manipulation tasks, our approach increases performance by $2\times$ - $50\times$. Increasing the model depth not only increases success rates but also qualitatively changes the behaviors learned.</p></details> | <details><summary>Link ...</summary><p>Link to project website: https://wang-kevin3290.github.io/scaling-crl/</p></details> |

High-quality reasoning data is crucial for improving LLMs' reasoning capabilities, but such datasets remain scarce. Existing approaches either rely on computationally expensive reinforcement learning (RL) or error-prone reasoning chains synthesized by LLMs, posing challenges in scalability and accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose SVRC (Structured and Validated Reasoning Chains for Code Generation), a novel framework that mines, restructures, and enriches reasoning chains from community-driven discussions on software engineering platforms. SVRC refines unstructured and incomplete discussions of coding problems by aligning them with Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) principles, ensuring that reasoning chains capture real-world problem-solving strategies and support iterative refinement. To evaluate the effectiveness of SVRC, we introduce CodeThinker, an LLM fine-tuned on 12,444 reasoning-augmented samples generated by SVRC. Experiments on LiveCodeBench show that CodeThinker surpasses its base model by 42.86\% on medium-level code problems in terms of pass@1 and outperforms GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o by 73.14\% and 115.86\%, respectively. Our ablation study further highlights that each component of SVRC contributes to the reasoning capabilities of CodeThinker.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has driven the growing need for intelligence, efficient, and adaptable wireless networks. Wireless networks require the empowerment of RL-based LLMs while these models also benefit from wireless networks to broaden their application scenarios. Specifically, RL-based LLMs can enhance wireless communication systems through intelligent resource allocation, adaptive network optimization, and real-time decision-making. Conversely, wireless networks provide a vital infrastructure for the efficient training, deployment, and distributed inference of RL-based LLMs, especially in decentralized and edge computing environments. This mutual empowerment highlights the need for a deeper exploration of the interplay between these two domains. We first review recent advancements in wireless communications, highlighting the associated challenges and potential solutions. We then discuss the progress of RL-based LLMs, focusing on key technologies for LLM training, challenges, and potential solutions. Subsequently, we explore the mutual empowerment between these two fields, highlighting key motivations, open challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we provide insights into future directions, applications, and their societal impact to further explore this intersection, paving the way for next-generation intelligent communication systems.

While precise environment dynamics may be hard to specify, human experts can often provide high-fidelity abstractions that capture the essential high-level structure of a task and user preferences in the target environment. Existing hierarchical approaches often target discrete settings and do not generalize across tasks. We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach that addresses these limitations by dynamically planning over the expert-specified abstraction to generate subgoals to learn a goal-conditioned policy. To overcome the challenges of learning under sparse rewards, we shape the reward based on the optimal state value in the abstract model. This structured decision-making process enhances sample efficiency and facilitates zero-shot generalization. Our empirical evaluation on a suite of procedurally generated continuous control environments demonstrates that our approach outperforms existing hierarchical reinforcement learning methods in terms of sample efficiency, task completion rate, scalability to complex tasks, and generalization to novel scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures.

However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions heavily rely on engineered heuristic strategies, which lack robustness and adaptability. Deep reinforcement learning has gained significant traction in various complex robotics tasks such as locomotion, manipulation, and competitive games (e.g., AlphaZero, OpenAI Five), making it a promising solution to the robot soccer problem. This paper introduces MARLadona. A decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) training pipeline capable of producing agents with sophisticated team play behavior, bridging the shortcomings of heuristic methods. Furthermore, we created an open-source multi-agent soccer environment. Utilizing our MARL framework and a modified global entity encoder (GEE) as our core architecture, our approach achieves a 66.8% win rate against HELIOS agent, which employs a state-of-the-art heuristic strategy.

In this paper, we present the Cosmos-Reason1 models that can understand the physical world and generate appropriate embodied decisions (e.g., next step action) in natural language through long chain-of-thought reasoning processes. We begin by defining key capabilities for Physical AI reasoning, with a focus on physical common sense and embodied reasoning. To represent physical common sense, we use a hierarchical ontology that captures fundamental knowledge about space, time, and physics. For embodied reasoning, we rely on a two-dimensional ontology that generalizes across different physical embodiments. Building on these capabilities, we develop two multimodal large language models, Cosmos-Reason1-8B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. We curate data and train our models in four stages: vision pre-training, general supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Physical AI SFT, and Physical AI reinforcement learning (RL) as the post-training. To evaluate our models, we build comprehensive benchmarks for physical common sense and embodied reasoning according to our ontologies. Evaluation results show that Physical AI SFT and reinforcement learning bring significant improvements. To facilitate the development of Physical AI, we will make our code and pre-trained models available under the NVIDIA Open Model License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1.</p></details> |  |

Potentially incompatible hypotheses have been made about the source of these improvements. One is that periodic activations learn low frequency representations and as a result avoid overfitting to bootstrapped targets. Another is that periodic activations learn high frequency representations that are more expressive, allowing networks to quickly fit complex value functions. We analyse these claims empirically, finding that periodic representations consistently converge to high frequencies regardless of their initialisation frequency. We also find that while periodic activation functions improve sample efficiency, they exhibit worse generalization on states with added observation noise -- especially when compared to otherwise equivalent networks with ReLU activation functions. Finally, we show that weight decay regularization is able to partially offset the overfitting of periodic activation functions, delivering value functions that learn quickly while also generalizing.</p></details> | <details><summary>RLC f...</summary><p>RLC format, fixed bug which incorrectly gave vanilla ReLU training runs weight decay</p></details> |

The study systematically assesses three state-of-the-art approaches, namely two differential pipelines and a data-driven approach. We also devise a novel physics-informed neural network approach for physics parameter estimation. These approaches are interfaced with two simulations across multiple Real-to-Sim scenarios (lifting, wind blowing, and stretching) for five different fabric types and evaluated on three unseen scenarios (folding, fling, and shaking). We found that the simulation engines and the choice of Real-to-Sim approaches significantly impact fabric manipulation performance in our evaluation scenarios. Moreover, PINN observes superior performance in quasi-static tasks but shows limitations in dynamic scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, the interplay between morphological and control complexities and their collective impact on task performance remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigate these trade-offs across tasks of differing difficulty levels using four well-used morphological complexity metrics and control complexity measured by FLOPs. We investigate how these factors jointly influence task performance by utilizing the evolutionary robot experiments. Results show that optimal performance depends on the alignment between morphology and control: simpler morphologies and lightweight controllers suffice for easier tasks, while harder tasks demand higher complexities in both dimensions. In addition, a clear trade-off between morphological and control complexities that achieve the same task performance can be observed. Moreover, we also propose a sensitivity analysis to expose the task-specific contributions of individual morphological metrics. Our study establishes a framework for investigating the relationships between morphology, control, and task performance, advancing the development of task-specific robotic designs that balance computational efficiency with adaptability. This study contributes to the practical application of soft robotics in real-world scenarios by providing actionable insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is planed to be submitted to a journal</p></details> |
| **[Wearable Haptics for a Marionette-inspired Teleoperation of Highly Redundant Robotic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15998v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The teleoperation of complex, kinematically redundant robots with loco-manipulation capabilities represents a challenge for human operators, who have to learn how to operate the many degrees of freedom of the robot to accomplish a desired task. In this context, developing an easy-to-learn and easy-to-use human-robot interface is paramount. Recent works introduced a novel teleoperation concept, which relies on a virtual physical interaction interface between the human operator and the remote robot equivalent to a "Marionette" control, but whose feedback was limited to only visual feedback on the human side. In this paper, we propose extending the "Marionette" interface by adding a wearable haptic interface to cope with the limitations given by the previous works. Leveraging the additional haptic feedback modality, the human operator gains full sensorimotor control over the robot, and the awareness about the robot's response and interactions with the environment is greatly improved. We evaluated the proposed interface and the related teleoperation framework with naive users, assessing the teleoperation performance and the user experience with and without haptic feedback. The conducted experiments consisted in a loco-manipulation mission with the CENTAURO robot, a hybrid leg-wheel quadruped with a humanoid dual-arm upper body.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A Laser-guided Interaction Interface for Providing Effective Robot Assistance to People with Upper Limbs Impairments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15987v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotics has shown significant potential in assisting people with disabilities to enhance their independence and involvement in daily activities. Indeed, a societal long-term impact is expected in home-care assistance with the deployment of intelligent robotic interfaces. This work presents a human-robot interface developed to help people with upper limbs impairments, such as those affected by stroke injuries, in activities of everyday life. The proposed interface leverages on a visual servoing guidance component, which utilizes an inexpensive but effective laser emitter device. By projecting the laser on a surface within the workspace of the robot, the user is able to guide the robotic manipulator to desired locations, to reach, grasp and manipulate objects. Considering the targeted users, the laser emitter is worn on the head, enabling to intuitively control the robot motions with head movements that point the laser in the environment, which projection is detected with a neural network based perception module. The interface implements two control modalities: the first allows the user to select specific locations directly, commanding the robot to reach those points; the second employs a paper keyboard with buttons that can be virtually pressed by pointing the laser at them. These buttons enable a more direct control of the Cartesian velocity of the end-effector and provides additional functionalities such as commanding the action of the gripper. The proposed interface is evaluated in a series of manipulation tasks involving a 6DOF assistive robot manipulator equipped with 1DOF beak-like gripper. The two interface modalities are combined to successfully accomplish tasks requiring bimanual capacity that is usually affected in people with upper limbs impairments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 12 figures |

We present a human-in-the-loop vision-based RL system that demonstrates impressive performance on a diverse set of dexterous manipulation tasks, including dynamic manipulation, precision assembly, and dual-arm coordination. Our approach integrates demonstrations and human corrections, efficient RL algorithms, and other system-level design choices to learn policies that achieve near-perfect success rates and fast cycle times within just 1 to 2.5 hours of training. We show that our method significantly outperforms imitation learning baselines and prior RL approaches, with an average 2x improvement in success rate and 1.8x faster execution. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating how it learns robust, adaptive policies for both reactive and predictive control strategies. Our results suggest that RL can indeed learn a wide range of complex vision-based manipulation policies directly in the real world within practical training times. We hope this work will inspire a new generation of learned robotic manipulation techniques, benefiting both industrial applications and research advancements.

| **[SERL: A Software Suite for Sample-Efficient Robotic Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16013v4)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of robotic reinforcement learning (RL), enabling methods that handle complex image observations, train in the real world, and incorporate auxiliary data, such as demonstrations and prior experience. However, despite these advances, robotic RL remains hard to use. It is acknowledged among practitioners that the particular implementation details of these algorithms are often just as important (if not more so) for performance as the choice of algorithm. We posit that a significant challenge to widespread adoption of robotic RL, as well as further development of robotic RL methods, is the comparative inaccessibility of such methods. To address this challenge, we developed a carefully implemented library containing a sample efficient off-policy deep RL method, together with methods for computing rewards and resetting the environment, a high-quality controller for a widely-adopted robot, and a number of challenging example tasks. We provide this library as a resource for the community, describe its design choices, and present experimental results. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that our implementation can achieve very efficient learning, acquiring policies for PCB board assembly, cable routing, and object relocation between 25 to 50 minutes of training per policy on average, improving over state-of-the-art results reported for similar tasks in the literature. These policies achieve perfect or near-perfect success rates, extreme robustness even under perturbations, and exhibit emergent recovery and correction behaviors. We hope that these promising results and our high-quality open-source implementation will provide a tool for the robotics community to facilitate further developments in robotic RL.

The algorithm uses a modified replay buffer inspired by the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) approach to artificially populate experience with successful trajectories, effectively addressing the problem of sparse reward scenarios and eliminating the need to manually collect expert demonstrations. The developed algorithm proposes a Transformer-based architecture to incorporate the context of previous states, allowing the agent to perform a deeper analysis and make decisions in a manner more akin to human learning. The effectiveness of the built-in replay buffer, which acts as an "internal demonstrator", is twofold: it accelerates learning and allows the algorithm to adapt to different tasks. Empirical data confirm the superiority of the algorithm by an average of 38.46% over other considered methods, and the most successful baseline by 28.21%, showing higher success rates and faster convergence in the point-reaching task. Since the control is performed through the robot's joints, the algorithm facilitates potential adaptation to a real robot system and construction of an obstacle avoidance task. Therefore, the algorithm has also been tested on tasks requiring following a complex dynamic trajectory and obstacle avoidance. The design of the algorithm ensures its applicability to a wide range of goal-oriented tasks, making it an easily integrated solution for real-world robotics applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

However, coordinating the tasks and motions of multiple robots is challenging due to issues, e.g. system uncertainty, task efficiency, algorithm scalability, and safety concerns. To address these challenges, this paper studies multi-robot coordination and proposes APEX-MR, an asynchronous planning and execution framework designed to safely and efficiently coordinate multiple robots to achieve cooperative assembly, e.g. LEGO assembly. In particular, APEX-MR provides a systematic approach to post-process multi-robot tasks and motion plans to enable robust asynchronous execution under uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that APEX-MR can significantly speed up the execution time of many long-horizon LEGO assembly tasks by 48% compared to sequential planning and 36% compared to synchronous planning on average. To further demonstrate the performance, we deploy APEX-MR to a dual-arm system to perform physical LEGO assembly. To our knowledge, this is the first robotic system capable of performing customized LEGO assembly using commercial LEGO bricks. The experiment results demonstrate that the dual-arm system, with APEX-MR, can safely coordinate robot motions, efficiently collaborate, and construct complex LEGO structures.

This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project released at: https://chenyi99.github.io/moto/ Update: Added content related to real-world robot experiments and learning from human videos</p></details> |

The cycloidal gear mechanism, with its inherent high torque density and mechanical robustness, offers significant advantages over conventional designs. By integrating cycloidal gears into the Quasi-Direct Drive framework, we aim to enhance the performance of legged robots, particularly in tasks demanding high torque and dynamic loads, while still keeping them lightweight. Additionally, we develop a torque estimation framework for the actuator using an Actuator Network, which effectively reduces the sim-to-real gap introduced by the cycloidal drive's complex dynamics. This integration is crucial for capturing the complex dynamics of a cycloidal drive, which contributes to improved learning efficiency, agility, and adaptability for reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceeding to 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA25)</p></details> |

Foundational models offer a transformative potential for child-robot interactions, enabling the design of personalized, engaging, and scalable interactions.

We introduce a hybrid approach to designing personalized educational dialogues in child-robot interactions.

| **[Reward Training Wheels: Adaptive Auxiliary Rewards for Robotics Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15724v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotics Reinforcement Learning (RL) often relies on carefully engineered auxiliary rewards to supplement sparse primary learning objectives to compensate for the lack of large-scale, real-world, trial-and-error data. While these auxiliary rewards accelerate learning, they require significant engineering effort, may introduce human biases, and cannot adapt to the robot's evolving capabilities during training. In this paper, we introduce Reward Training Wheels (RTW), a teacher-student framework that automates auxiliary reward adaptation for robotics RL. To be specific, the RTW teacher dynamically adjusts auxiliary reward weights based on the student's evolving capabilities to determine which auxiliary reward aspects require more or less emphasis to improve the primary objective. We demonstrate RTW on two challenging robot tasks: navigation in highly constrained spaces and off-road vehicle mobility on vertically challenging terrain. In simulation, RTW outperforms expert-designed rewards by 2.35% in navigation success rate and improves off-road mobility performance by 122.62%, while achieving 35% and 3X faster training efficiency, respectively. Physical robot experiments further validate RTW's effectiveness, achieving a perfect success rate (5/5 trials vs. 2/5 for expert-designed rewards) and improving vehicle stability with up to 47.4% reduction in orientation angles.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, ensuring safety in LLM-driven plans remains a critical challenge, as these models often prioritize task completion over risk mitigation. This paper introduces SAFER (Safety-Aware Framework for Execution in Robotics), a multi-LLM framework designed to embed safety awareness into robotic task planning. SAFER employs a Safety Agent that operates alongside the primary task planner, providing safety feedback. Additionally, we introduce LLM-as-a-Judge, a novel metric leveraging LLMs as evaluators to quantify safety violations within generated task plans. Our framework integrates safety feedback at multiple stages of execution, enabling real-time risk assessment, proactive error correction, and transparent safety evaluation. We also integrate a control framework using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to ensure safety guarantees within SAFER's task planning. We evaluated SAFER against state-of-the-art LLM planners on complex long-horizon tasks involving heterogeneous robotic agents, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing safety violations while maintaining task efficiency. We also verify the task planner and safety planner through actual hardware experiments involving multiple robots and a human.</p></details> |  |

Two autonomous mobile robots (which can move with a maximum speed of 1) are initially placed at the origin, while an oblivious moving target is initially placed at a distance $d$ away from the origin. The robots can move along the line in any direction, but the target is oblivious, cannot change direction, and moves either away from or toward the origin at a constant speed $v$. Our aim is to design efficient algorithms for the two robots to capture the target. The target is captured only when both robots are co-located with it. The robots communicate with each other only face-to-face (F2F), meaning they can exchange information only when co-located, while the target remains oblivious and has no communication capabilities. We design algorithms under various knowledge scenarios, which take into account the prior knowledge the robots have about the starting distance $d$, the direction of movement (either toward or away from the origin), and the speed $v$ of the target. As a measure of the efficiency of the algorithms, we use the competitive ratio, which is the ratio of the capture time of an algorithm with limited knowledge to the capture time in the full-knowledge model. In our analysis, we are mindful of the cost of changing direction of movement, and show how to accomplish the capture of the target with at most three direction changes (turns).</p></details> |  |
| **[Robotic Paper Wrapping by Learning Force Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15685v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic packaging using wrapping paper poses significant challenges due to the material's complex deformation properties. The packaging process itself involves multiple steps, primarily categorized as folding the paper or creating creases. Small deviations in the robot's arm trajectory or force vector can lead to tearing or wrinkling of the paper, exacerbated by the variability in material properties. This study introduces a novel framework that combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning to enable a robot to perform each step of the packaging process efficiently. The framework allows the robot to follow approximate trajectories of the tool-center point (TCP) based on human demonstrations while optimizing force control parameters to prevent tearing or wrinkling, even with variable wrapping paper materials. The proposed method was validated through ablation studies, which demonstrated successful task completion with a significant reduction in tear and wrinkle rates. Furthermore, the force control strategy proved to be adaptable across different wrapping paper materials and robust against variations in the size of the target object.</p></details> |  |
| **[Friction-Scaled Vibrotactile Feedback for Real-Time Slip Detection in Manipulation using Robotic Sixth Finger](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15447v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of extra-robotic limbs/fingers to enhance and expand motor skills, particularly for grasping and manipulation, possesses significant challenges. The grasping performance of existing limbs/fingers is far inferior to that of human hands. Human hands can detect onset of slip through tactile feedback originating from tactile receptors during the grasping process, enabling precise and automatic regulation of grip force. The frictional information is perceived by humans depending upon slip happening between finger and object. Enhancing this capability in extra-robotic limbs or fingers used by humans is challenging. To address this challenge, this paper introduces novel approach to communicate frictional information to users through encoded vibrotactile cues. These cues are conveyed on onset of incipient slip thus allowing users to perceive friction and ultimately use this information to increase force to avoid dropping of object. In a 2-alternative forced-choice protocol, participants gripped and lifted a glass under three different frictional conditions, applying a normal force of 3.5 N. After reaching this force, glass was gradually released to induce slip. During this slipping phase, vibrations scaled according to static coefficient of friction were presented to users, reflecting frictional conditions. The results suggested an accuracy of 94.53 p/m 3.05 (mean p/mSD) in perceiving frictional information upon lifting objects with varying friction. The results indicate effectiveness of using vibrotactile feedback for sensory feedback, allowing users of extra-robotic limbs or fingers to perceive frictional information. This enables them to assess surface properties and adjust grip force according to frictional conditions, enhancing their ability to grasp, manipulate objects more effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diff-DAgger: Uncertainty Estimation with Diffusion Policy for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14868v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion policy has shown impressive results in handling multi-modal tasks in robotic manipulation. However, it has fundamental limitations in out-of-distribution failures that persist due to compounding errors and its limited capability to extrapolate. One way to address these limitations is robot-gated DAgger, an interactive imitation learning with a robot query system to actively seek expert help during policy rollout. While robot-gated DAgger has high potential for learning at scale, existing methods like Ensemble-DAgger struggle with highly expressive policies: They often misinterpret policy disagreements as uncertainty at multi-modal decision points. To address this problem, we introduce Diff-DAgger, an efficient robot-gated DAgger algorithm that leverages the training objective of diffusion policy. We evaluate Diff-DAgger across different robot tasks including stacking, pushing, and plugging, and show that Diff-DAgger improves the task failure prediction by 39.0%, the task completion rate by 20.6%, and reduces the wall-clock time by a factor of 7.8. We hope that this work opens up a path for efficiently incorporating expressive yet data-hungry policies into interactive robot learning settings.

| **[A Unified Framework for Real-Time Failure Handling in Robotics Using Vision-Language Models, Reactive Planner and Behavior Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15202v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic systems often face execution failures due to unexpected obstacles, sensor errors, or environmental changes. Traditional failure recovery methods rely on predefined strategies or human intervention, making them less adaptable. This paper presents a unified failure recovery framework that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs), a reactive planner, and Behavior Trees (BTs) to enable real-time failure handling. Our approach includes pre-execution verification, which checks for potential failures before execution, and reactive failure handling, which detects and corrects failures during execution by verifying existing BT conditions, adding missing preconditions and, when necessary, generating new skills. The framework uses a scene graph for structured environmental perception and an execution history for continuous monitoring, enabling context-aware and adaptive failure handling. We evaluate our framework through real-world experiments with an ABB YuMi robot on tasks like peg insertion, object sorting, and drawer placement, as well as in AI2-THOR simulator. Compared to using pre-execution and reactive methods separately, our approach achieves higher task success rates and greater adaptability. Ablation studies highlight the importance of VLM-based reasoning, structured scene representation, and execution history tracking for effective failure recovery in robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparative Study of Human Motion Models in Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Social Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15127v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social robot navigation is an evolving research field that aims to find efficient strategies to safely navigate dynamic environments populated by humans. A critical challenge in this domain is the accurate modeling of human motion, which directly impacts the design and evaluation of navigation algorithms. This paper presents a comparative study of two popular categories of human motion models used in social robot navigation, namely velocity-based models and force-based models. A system-theoretic representation of both model types is presented, which highlights their common feedback structure, although with different state variables. Several navigation policies based on reinforcement learning are trained and tested in various simulated environments involving pedestrian crowds modeled with these approaches. A comparative study is conducted to assess performance across multiple factors, including human motion model, navigation policy, scenario complexity and crowd density. The results highlight advantages and challenges of different approaches to modeling human behavior, as well as their role during training and testing of learning-based navigation policies. The findings offer valuable insights and guidelines for selecting appropriate human motion models when designing socially-aware robot navigation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-horizon Locomotion and Manipulation on a Quadrupedal Robot with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05291v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a large language model (LLM) based system to empower quadrupedal robots with problem-solving abilities for long-horizon tasks beyond short-term motions. Long-horizon tasks for quadrupeds are challenging since they require both a high-level understanding of the semantics of the problem for task planning and a broad range of locomotion and manipulation skills to interact with the environment. Our system builds a high-level reasoning layer with large language models, which generates hybrid discrete-continuous plans as robot code from task descriptions. It comprises multiple LLM agents: a semantic planner that sketches a plan, a parameter calculator that predicts arguments in the plan, a code generator that converts the plan into executable robot code, and a replanner that handles execution failures or human interventions. At the low level, we adopt reinforcement learning to train a set of motion planning and control skills to unleash the flexibility of quadrupeds for rich environment interactions. Our system is tested on long-horizon tasks that are infeasible to complete with one single skill. Simulation and real-world experiments show that it successfully figures out multi-step strategies and demonstrates non-trivial behaviors, including building tools or notifying a human for help. Demos are available on our project page: https://sites.google.com/view/long-horizon-robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[StyleLoco: Generative Adversarial Distillation for Natural Humanoid Robot Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15082v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots are anticipated to acquire a wide range of locomotion capabilities while ensuring natural movement across varying speeds and terrains. Existing methods encounter a fundamental dilemma in learning humanoid locomotion: reinforcement learning with handcrafted rewards can achieve agile locomotion but produces unnatural gaits, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) with motion capture data yields natural movements but suffers from unstable training processes and restricted agility. Integrating these approaches proves challenging due to the inherent heterogeneity between expert policies and human motion datasets. To address this, we introduce StyleLoco, a novel two-stage framework that bridges this gap through a Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD) process. Our framework begins by training a teacher policy using reinforcement learning to achieve agile and dynamic locomotion. It then employs a multi-discriminator architecture, where distinct discriminators concurrently extract skills from both the teacher policy and motion capture data. This approach effectively combines the agility of reinforcement learning with the natural fluidity of human-like movements while mitigating the instability issues commonly associated with adversarial training. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that StyleLoco enables humanoid robots to perform diverse locomotion tasks with the precision of expertly trained policies and the natural aesthetics of human motion, successfully transferring styles across different movement types while maintaining stable locomotion across a broad spectrum of command inputs.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Our analysis reveals that even state-of-the-art policy models frequently exhibit unstable grasping behaviors, leading to failure cases that create bottlenecks in real-world robotic applications. To address these challenges, we introduce GraspCorrect, a plug-and-play module designed to enhance grasp performance through vision-language model-guided feedback. GraspCorrect employs an iterative visual question-answering framework with two key components: grasp-guided prompting, which incorporates task-specific constraints, and object-aware sampling, which ensures the selection of physically feasible grasp candidates. By iteratively generating intermediate visual goals and translating them into joint-level actions, GraspCorrect significantly improves grasp stability and consistently enhances task success rates across existing policy models in the RLBench and CALVIN datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, a learning-based approach based on condensation of the FEM model is detailed. The proposed method handles several kinds of actuators and contacts with the environment. We demonstrate that this compact model can be learned as a unified model across several designs and remains very efficient in terms of modeling since we can deduce the direct and inverse kinematics of the robot. Building upon the intuition introduced in [11], the learned model is presented as a general framework for modeling, controlling, and designing soft manipulators. First, the method's adaptability and versatility are illustrated through optimization based control problems involving positioning and manipulation tasks with mechanical contact-based coupling. Secondly, the low memory consumption and the high prediction speed of the learned condensed model are leveraged for real-time embedding control without relying on costly online FEM simulation. Finally, the ability of the learned condensed FEM model to capture soft robot design variations and its differentiability are leveraged in calibration and design optimization applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Robotics, In press</p></details> |

This paper introduces ILSA, an Incrementally Learned Shared Autonomy framework that continually improves its assistive control policy through repeated user interactions. ILSA leverages synthetic kinematic trajectories for initial pretraining, reducing the need for expert demonstrations, and then incrementally finetunes its policy after each manipulation interaction, with mechanisms to balance new knowledge acquisition with existing knowledge retention during incremental learning. We validate ILSA for complex long-horizon tasks through a comprehensive ablation study and a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in both quantitative performance and user-reported qualitative metrics.

This article focuses on proxemics, proposing a new taxonomy and suggesting future directions through an analysis of state-of-the-art studies and the identification of research gaps. The various factors that affect the dynamic properties of proxemics patterns in human-robot interaction are thoroughly explored. To establish a coherent proxemics framework, we identified and organized the key parameters and attributes that shape proxemics behavior. Building on this framework, we introduce a novel approach to define proxemics in robot navigation, emphasizing the significant attributes that influence its structure and size. This leads to the development of a new taxonomy that serves as a foundation for guiding future research and development. Our findings underscore the complexity of defining personal distance, revealing it as a complex, multi-dimensional challenge. Furthermore, we highlight the flexible and dynamic nature of personal zone boundaries, which should be adaptable to different contexts and circumstances. Additionally, we propose a new layer for implementing proxemics in the navigation of social robots.</p></details> |  |

Visual sensors like depth cameras enhance stability and robustness but face limitations, such as low operating frequencies relative to joint control and sensitivity to lighting, which hinder outdoor deployment. Additionally, deep neural networks in sensor and control systems increase computational demands. To address these issues, we introduce spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event cameras to perform a challenging quadruped parkour task. Event cameras capture dynamic visual data, while SNNs efficiently process spike sequences, mimicking biological perception. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms traditional models, achieving excellent parkour performance with just 11.7% of the energy consumption of an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model, yielding an 88.3% energy reduction. By integrating event cameras with SNNs, our work advances robotic reinforcement learning and opens new possibilities for applications in demanding environments.</p></details> |  |

However, developing low-cost solutions for their motion and planning problems remains a significant challenge in this field. This paper investigates the application of geometric iterative strategy methods to continuum robots, and proposes the algorithm based on an improved two-layer geometric iterative strategy for motion planning. First, we thoroughly study the kinematics and effective workspace of a multi-segment tendon-driven continuum robot with a floating base. Then, generalized iterative algorithms for solving arbitrary-segment continuum robots are proposed based on a series of problems such as initial arm shape dependence exhibited by similar methods when applied to continuum robots. Further, the task scenario is extended to a follow-the-leader task considering environmental factors, and further extended algorithm are proposed. Simulation comparison results with similar methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in eliminating the initial arm shape dependence and improving the solution efficiency and accuracy. The experimental results further demonstrate that the method based on improved two-layer geometric iteration can be used for motion planning task of a continuum robot with a floating base, under an average deviation of about 4 mm in the end position, an average orientation deviation of no more than 1 degree, and the reduction of average number of iterations and time cost is 127.4 iterations and 72.6 ms compared with similar methods, respectively.</p></details> | 32 pages, 16 figures |

Using real neural data recorded from motor and premotor cortex areas of a macaque monkey named Jenkins, we develop models for decoding (converting brain signals into robotic arm movements) and encoding (simulating brain activity corresponding to a given movement). For the interface between the brain simulation and the physical world, we utilized Koch v1.1 leader and follower robotic arms. We developed an interactive web console that allows users to generate synthetic brain data from joystick movements in real time. Our results are a step towards brain-controlled robotics, prosthetics, and enhancing normal motor function. By accurately modeling brain activity, we take a step toward flexible brain-computer interfaces that generalize beyond predefined movements.

This problem arises under obstructed visibility, where a robot cannot see another robot if there is a third robot on the straight line segment between the two robots. We assume that a robot's movement cannot be interrupted by an adversary and that robots have a small $O(1)$-sized memory that they can use to store information, but that cannot be communicated to the other robots. To solve this problem, we present an algorithm that works in three steps. First it establishes mutual visibility, then it elects one robot to be the leader, and finally it forms the required pattern. The whole algorithm runs in $O(n) + O(q \log n)$ rounds with probability at least $1 - n^{-q}$. The algorithms are collision-free and do not require the knowledge of the number of robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.14440</p></details> |

These robots take inspiration from biology: salps are gelatinous, jellyfish-like marine animals that utilize jet propulsion for maneuvering and can physically connect to form dynamic chains of arbitrary shape and size. The primary contributions of this research are twofold: first, we adapt a planar nonlinear multi-link snake robot model to model a planar multi-link salp-inspired system by removing joint actuators, introducing link thrusters, and allowing for non-uniform link lengths, masses, and moments of inertia. Second, we conduct a nonlinear observability analysis of the multi-link system with link thrusters, showing that the link angles, angular velocities, masses, and moments of inertia are locally observable when equipped with inertial measurement units and operating under specific thruster conditions. This research provides a theoretical foundation for modeling and estimating both the state and intrinsic parameters of a multi-link system with link thrusters, which are essential for effective controller design and performance.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 table |

Robotic assistance offers a promising solution by improving needle trajectory accuracy, reducing radiation exposure, and enabling real-time adjustments. In our previous work, we introduced a redundant robotic platform designed for dexterous needle insertion within the confined CT bore. However, its limited base mobility restricts flexible deployment in clinical settings. In this study, we present an improved 11-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic system that integrates a 6-DOF robotic base with a 5-DOF cable-driven end-effector, significantly enhancing workspace flexibility and precision. With the hyper-redundant degrees of freedom, we introduce a weighted inverse kinematics controller with a two-stage priority scheme for large-scale movement and fine in-bore adjustments, along with a null-space control strategy to optimize dexterity. We validate our system through both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating superior tracking accuracy and enhanced manipulability in CT-guided procedures. The study provides a strong case for hyper-redundancy and null-space control formulations for robot-assisted needle biopsy scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in humanoid robots have shown great promise as a hardware platform for building generalist autonomy in the human world. A robot foundation model, trained on massive and diverse data sources, is essential for enabling the robots to reason about novel situations, robustly handle real-world variability, and rapidly learn new tasks. To this end, we introduce GR00T N1, an open foundation model for humanoid robots. GR00T N1 is a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a dual-system architecture. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The subsequent diffusion transformer module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Both modules are tightly coupled and jointly trained end-to-end. We train GR00T N1 with a heterogeneous mixture of real-robot trajectories, human videos, and synthetically generated datasets. We show that our generalist robot model GR00T N1 outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks across multiple robot embodiments. Furthermore, we deploy our model on the Fourier GR-1 humanoid robot for language-conditioned bimanual manipulation tasks, achieving strong performance with high data efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed alphabetically.

Expert integrators must consider factors such as placement, payload, and robot reach requirements to determine the feasibility of automation. Ideally, such considerations are based on a detailed digital simulation developed before any hardware is deployed. However, this process is often time-consuming and challenging. To simplify these processes, we introduce a much simpler method for the feasibility analysis of robotic arms' reachability, designed for non-experts. We implement this method through a mobile, sensing-based prototype tool. The two-step experimental evaluation included the expert user study results, which helped us identify the difficulty levels of various deployment scenarios and refine the initial prototype. The results of the subsequent quantitative study with 22 non-expert participants utilizing both scenarios indicate that users could complete both simple and complex feasibility analyses in under ten minutes, exhibiting similar cognitive loads and high engagement. Overall, the results suggest that the tool was well-received and rated as highly usable, thereby showing a new path for changing the ease of feasibility analysis for automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE RA-L</p></details> |

Traditional marker-based methods often require human intervention for system setup. Furthermore, existing autonomous markerless calibration methods typically rely on pre-trained robot tracking models that impede their application on edge devices and require fine-tuning for novel robot embodiments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a model-based markerless camera-to-robot calibration framework, ARC-Calib, that is fully autonomous and generalizable across diverse robots and scenarios without requiring extensive data collection or learning. First, exploratory robot motions are introduced to generate easily trackable trajectory-based visual patterns in the camera's image frames. Then, a geometric optimization framework is proposed to exploit the coplanarity and collinearity constraints from the observed motions to iteratively refine the estimated calibration result. Our approach eliminates the need for extra effort in either environmental marker setup or data collection and model training, rendering it highly adaptable across a wide range of real-world autonomous systems. Extensive experiments are conducted in both simulation and the real world to validate its robustness and generalizability.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

| **[Model Predictive Path Integral Control of I2RIS Robot Using RBF Identifier and Extended Kalman Filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14684v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling and controlling cable-driven snake robots is a challenging problem due to nonlinear mechanical properties such as hysteresis, variable stiffness, and unknown friction between the actuation cables and the robot body. This challenge is more significant for snake robots in ophthalmic surgery applications, such as the Improved Integrated Robotic Intraocular Snake (I$^2$RIS), given its small size and lack of embedded sensory feedback. Data-driven models take advantage of global function approximations, reducing complicated analytical models' challenge and computational costs. However, their performance might deteriorate in case of new data unseen in the training phase. Therefore, adding an adaptation mechanism might improve these models' performance during snake robots' interactions with unknown environments. In this work, we applied a model predictive path integral (MPPI) controller on a data-driven model of the I$^2$RIS based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and Gaussian mixture regression (GMR). To analyze the performance of the MPPI in unseen robot-tissue interaction situations, unknown external disturbances and environmental loads are simulated and added to the GMM-GMR model. These uncertainties of the robot model are then identified online using a radial basis function (RBF) whose weights are updated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Simulation results demonstrated the robustness of the optimal control solutions of the MPPI algorithm and its computational superiority over a conventional model predictive control (MPC) algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning-Based Neuroadaptive Control of Robotic Manipulators under Deferred Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14669v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based neuroadaptive control framework for robotic manipulators operating under deferred constraints. The proposed approach improves traditional barrier Lyapunov functions by introducing a smooth constraint enforcement mechanism that offers two key advantages: (i) it minimizes control effort in unconstrained regions and progressively increases it near constraints, improving energy efficiency, and (ii) it enables gradual constraint activation through a prescribed-time shifting function, allowing safe operation even when initial conditions violate constraints. To address system uncertainties and improve adaptability, an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework is employed. The critic network estimates the value function, while the actor network learns an optimal control policy in real time, enabling adaptive constraint handling without requiring explicit system modeling. Lyapunov-based stability analysis guarantees the boundedness of all closed-loop signals. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Safety-Critical and Distributed Nonlinear Predictive Controllers for Teams of Quadrupedal Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14656v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel hierarchical, safety-critical control framework that integrates distributed nonlinear model predictive controllers (DNMPCs) with control barrier functions (CBFs) to enable cooperative locomotion of multi-agent quadrupedal robots in complex environments. While NMPC-based methods are widely adopted for enforcing safety constraints and navigating multi-robot systems (MRSs) through intricate environments, ensuring the safety of MRSs requires a formal definition grounded in the concept of invariant sets. CBFs, typically implemented via quadratic programs (QPs) at the planning layer, provide formal safety guarantees. However, their zero-control horizon limits their effectiveness for extended trajectory planning in inherently unstable, underactuated, and nonlinear legged robot models. Furthermore, the integration of CBFs into real-time NMPC for sophisticated MRSs, such as quadrupedal robot teams, remains underexplored. This paper develops computationally efficient, distributed NMPC algorithms that incorporate CBF-based collision safety guarantees within a consensus protocol, enabling longer planning horizons for safe cooperative locomotion under disturbances and rough terrain conditions. The optimal trajectories generated by the DNMPCs are tracked using full-order, nonlinear whole-body controllers at the low level. The proposed approach is validated through extensive numerical simulations with up to four Unitree A1 robots and hardware experiments involving two A1 robots subjected to external pushes, rough terrain, and uncertain obstacle information. Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed CBF-based DNMPCs achieve a 27.89% higher success rate than conventional NMPCs without CBF constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Framework for Robots that Influence Humans over Long-Term Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14633v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot actions influence the decisions of nearby humans. Here influence refers to intentional change: robots influence humans when they shift the human's behavior in a way that helps the robot complete its task. Imagine an autonomous car trying to merge; by proactively nudging into the human's lane, the robot causes human drivers to yield and provide space. Influence is often necessary for seamless interaction. However, if influence is left unregulated and uncontrolled, robots will negatively impact the humans around them. Prior works have begun to address this problem by creating a variety of control algorithms that seek to influence humans. Although these methods are effective in the short-term, they fail to maintain influence over time as the human adapts to the robot's behaviors. In this paper we therefore present an optimization framework that enables robots to purposely regulate their influence over humans across both short-term and long-term interactions. Here the robot maintains its influence by reasoning over a dynamic human model which captures how the robot's current choices will impact the human's future behavior. Our resulting framework serves to unify current approaches: we demonstrate that state-of-the-art methods are simplifications of our underlying formalism. Our framework also provides a principled way to generate influential policies: in the best case the robot exactly solves our framework to find optimal, influential behavior. But when solving this optimization problem becomes impractical, designers can introduce their own simplifications to reach tractable approximations. We experimentally compare our unified framework to state-of-the-art baselines and ablations, and demonstrate across simulations and user studies that this framework is able to successfully influence humans over repeated interactions.

| **[Physically-Consistent Parameter Identification of Robots in Contact](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09850v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate inertial parameter identification is crucial for the simulation and control of robots encountering intermittent contact with the environment. Classically, robots' inertial parameters are obtained from CAD models that are not precise (and sometimes not available, e.g., Spot from Boston Dynamics), hence requiring identification. To do that, existing methods require access to contact force measurement, a modality not present in modern quadruped and humanoid robots. This paper presents an alternative technique that utilizes joint current/torque measurements -- a standard sensing modality in modern robots -- to identify inertial parameters without requiring direct contact force measurements. By projecting the whole-body dynamics into the null space of contact constraints, we eliminate the dependency on contact forces and reformulate the identification problem as a linear matrix inequality that can handle physical and geometrical constraints. We compare our proposed method against a common black-box identification method using a deep neural network and show that incorporating physical consistency significantly improves the sample efficiency and generalizability of the model. Finally, we validate our method on the Spot quadruped robot across various locomotion tasks, showcasing its accuracy and generalizability in real-world scenarios over different gaits.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The design prioritizes enhanced locomotion capabilities, improved reliability and safety of the actuation system, and simplified, cost-effective manufacturing processes. Locomotion performance is optimized through a sandwiched leg design and a dual-motor configuration, reducing leg inertia for agile movements. Reliability and safety are achieved by integrating robust cable strain reliefs, efficient heat sinks for motor thermal management, and mechanical limits to restrict leg motion. Simplified design considerations include a quasi-direct drive (QDD) actuator and the adoption of low-cost fabrication techniques, such as laser cutting and 3D printing, to minimize cost and ensure rapid prototyping. The robot weighs approximately 25 kg and is developed at a cost under \$8000, making it a scalable and affordable solution for robotics research. Experimental validations demonstrate the platform's capability to execute trot and crawl gaits on flat terrain and slopes, highlighting its potential as a versatile and reliable quadruped research platform.</p></details> | 6 pages, 9 figures |
| **[CTSAC: Curriculum-Based Transformer Soft Actor-Critic for Goal-Oriented Robot Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14254v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing demand for efficient and flexible robotic exploration solutions, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is becoming a promising approach in the field of autonomous robotic exploration. However, current RL-based exploration algorithms often face limited environmental reasoning capabilities, slow convergence rates, and substantial challenges in Sim-To-Real (S2R) transfer. To address these issues, we propose a Curriculum Learning-based Transformer Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (CTSAC) aimed at improving both exploration efficiency and transfer performance. To enhance the robot's reasoning ability, a Transformer is integrated into the perception network of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, leveraging historical information to improve the farsightedness of the strategy. A periodic review-based curriculum learning is proposed, which enhances training efficiency while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during curriculum transitions. Training is conducted on the ROS-Gazebo continuous robotic simulation platform, with LiDAR clustering optimization to further reduce the S2R gap. Experimental results demonstrate the CTSAC algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art non-learning and learning-based algorithms in terms of success rate and success rate-weighted exploration time. Moreover, real-world experiments validate the strong S2R transfer capabilities of CTSAC.</p></details> | <details><summary>7page...</summary><p>7pages,7 figures,Thesis received by 2025 ICRA</p></details> |

Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry, inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments. The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on collected legged robots and open-source datasets. To further promote research and development, the open-source datasets and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/NSN-Hello/GeoFlow-SLAM</p></details> | 8 pages |

An intuitive way for humans to express these goals is through abstract cues like verbal commands or rough sketches. Such human guidance may lack details or be noisy. Nonetheless, we expect robots to navigate as intended. For robots to interpret and execute these abstract instructions in line with human expectations, they must share a common understanding of basic navigation concepts with humans. To this end, we introduce CANVAS, a novel framework that combines visual and linguistic instructions for commonsense-aware navigation. Its success is driven by imitation learning, enabling the robot to learn from human navigation behavior. We present COMMAND, a comprehensive dataset with human-annotated navigation results, spanning over 48 hours and 219 km, designed to train commonsense-aware navigation systems in simulated environments. Our experiments show that CANVAS outperforms the strong rule-based system ROS NavStack across all environments, demonstrating superior performance with noisy instructions. Notably, in the orchard environment, where ROS NavStack records a 0% total success rate, CANVAS achieves a total success rate of 67%. CANVAS also closely aligns with human demonstrations and commonsense constraints, even in unseen environments. Furthermore, real-world deployment of CANVAS showcases impressive Sim2Real transfer with a total success rate of 69%, highlighting the potential of learning from human demonstrations in simulated environments for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025, project page https://worv-ai.github.io/canvas</p></details> |

We solve this problem by combining Conflict-Based Search (CBS), a multi-agent path finding method, and discontinuity-bounded A*, a single-robot kinodynamic motion planner. Our method, db-CBS, operates in three levels. Initially, we compute trajectories for individual robots using a graph search that allows bounded discontinuities between precomputed motion primitives. The second level identifies inter-robot collisions and resolves them by imposing constraints on the first level. The third and final level uses the resulting solution with discontinuities as an initial guess for a joint space trajectory optimization. The procedure is repeated with a reduced discontinuity bound. Our approach is anytime, probabilistically complete, asymptotically optimal, and finds near-optimal solutions quickly. Experimental results with robot dynamics such as unicycle, double integrator, and car with trailer in different settings show that our method is capable of solving challenging tasks with a higher success rate and lower cost than the existing state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICRA 2024</p></details> |
| **[An Real-Sim-Real (RSR) Loop Framework for Generalizable Robotic Policy Transfer with Differentiable Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10118v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sim-to-real gap remains a critical challenge in robotics, hindering the deployment of algorithms trained in simulation to real-world systems. This paper introduces a novel Real-Sim-Real (RSR) loop framework leveraging differentiable simulation to address this gap by iteratively refining simulation parameters, aligning them with real-world conditions, and enabling robust and efficient policy transfer. A key contribution of our work is the design of an informative cost function that encourages the collection of diverse and representative real-world data, minimizing bias and maximizing the utility of each data point for simulation refinement. This cost function integrates seamlessly into existing reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC) and ensures a balanced exploration of critical regions in the real domain. Furthermore, our approach is implemented on the versatile Mujoco MJX platform, and our framework is compatible with a wide range of robotic systems. Experimental results on several robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the sim-to-real gap, achieving high task performance and generalizability across diverse scenarios of both explicit and implicit environmental uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional deep learning and Transformer models often struggle to process data with inherent symmetries and invariances, typically relying on large datasets or extensive data augmentation. Equivariant neural networks overcome these limitations by explicitly integrating symmetry and invariance into their architectures, leading to improved efficiency and generalization. This tutorial survey reviews a wide range of equivariant deep learning and control methods for robotics, from classic to state-of-the-art, with a focus on SE(3)-equivariant models that leverage the natural 3D rotational and translational symmetries in visual robotic manipulation and control design. Using unified mathematical notation, we begin by reviewing key concepts from group theory, along with matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. We then introduce foundational group-equivariant neural network design and show how the group-equivariance can be obtained through their structure. Next, we discuss the applications of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks in robotics in terms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The SE(3)-equivariant control design is also reviewed from the perspective of geometric control. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of equivariant methods in developing more robust, sample-efficient, and multi-modal real-world robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Journcal of Control, Automation and Systems (IJCAS), Under Review</p></details> |

Inspired by the Mount Lyell salamander's ability to curl its body into a loop and effectively roll down {\Revision hill slopes}, in this study we develop a sand-rolling robot and investigate how its locomotion performance is governed by the shape of its body. We experimentally tested three different body shapes: Hexagon, Quadrilateral, and Triangle. We found that Hexagon and Triangle can achieve a faster rolling speed on sand, but exhibited more frequent failures of getting stuck. Analysis of the interaction between robot and sand revealed the failure mechanism: the deformation of the sand produced a local ``sand incline'' underneath robot contact segments, increasing the effective region of supporting polygon (ERSP) and preventing the robot from shifting its center of mass (CoM) outside the ERSP to produce sustainable rolling. Based on this mechanism, a highly-simplified model successfully captured the critical body pitch for each rolling shape to produce sustained rolling on sand, and informed design adaptations that mitigated the locomotion failures and improved robot speed by more than 200$\%$. Our results provide insights into how locomotors can utilize different morphological features to achieve robust rolling motion across deformable substrates.</p></details> |  |

| **[Robotic Compliant Object Prying Using Diffusion Policy Guided by Vision and Force Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03998v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of batteries in the electric vehicle industry and various consumer products has created an urgent need for effective recycling solutions. These products often contain a mix of compliant and rigid components, making robotic disassembly a critical step toward achieving scalable recycling processes. Diffusion policy has emerged as a promising approach for learning low-level skills in robotics. To effectively apply diffusion policy to contact-rich tasks, incorporating force as feedback is essential. In this paper, we apply diffusion policy with vision and force in a compliant object prying task. However, when combining low-dimensional contact force with high-dimensional image, the force information may be diluted. To address this issue, we propose a method that effectively integrates force with image data for diffusion policy observations. We validate our approach on a battery prying task that demands high precision and multi-step execution. Our model achieves a 96\% success rate in diverse scenarios, marking a 57\% improvement over the vision-only baseline. Our method also demonstrates zero-shot transfer capability to handle unseen objects and battery types.

| **[Automatic MILP Model Construction for Multi-Robot Task Allocation and Scheduling Based on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13813v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the accelerated development of Industry 4.0, intelligent manufacturing systems increasingly require efficient task allocation and scheduling in multi-robot systems. However, existing methods rely on domain expertise and face challenges in adapting to dynamic production constraints. Additionally, enterprises have high privacy requirements for production scheduling data, which prevents the use of cloud-based large language models (LLMs) for solution development. To address these challenges, there is an urgent need for an automated modeling solution that meets data privacy requirements. This study proposes a knowledge-augmented mixed integer linear programming (MILP) automated formulation framework, integrating local LLMs with domain-specific knowledge bases to generate executable code from natural language descriptions automatically. The framework employs a knowledge-guided DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model to extract complex spatiotemporal constraints (82% average accuracy) and leverages a supervised fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct model for efficient MILP code generation (90% average accuracy). Experimental results demonstrate that the framework successfully achieves automatic modeling in the aircraft skin manufacturing case while ensuring data privacy and computational efficiency. This research provides a low-barrier and highly reliable technical path for modeling in complex industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Augmented Reality Interface for Teleoperating Robot Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18394v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective real-time robot control is essential as we increasingly integrate robots into various societal contexts. Moreover, obtaining high-quality demonstration data is critical for the success of data-driven approaches, such as imitation learning. Existing platforms for robot control and data collection in manipulation tasks often place significant physical and mental demands on the user, require additional hardware, or necessitate specialized knowledge. In this work, we introduce a novel augmented reality interface for teleoperating robotic manipulators, focusing on the user experience, particularly when performing complex, precise tasks. Designed for the Microsoft HoloLens 2, this interface leverages the adaptability of mixed reality, allowing users to control a physical robot via a digital end effector surrogate. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across four complex manipulation tasks and compare its performance with the 3D SpaceMouse, a traditional teleoperation method in robotics, and kinesthetic teaching, the assumed performance upperbound in robotic control. Our findings reveal that, quantitatively, our method addresses a key limitation of the SpaceMouse: its unintuitive mapping of rotations. Additionally, a user study demonstrates that our AR-based system achieves higher usability scores and recommendation likelihood, and lower task load compared to the SpaceMouse.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Synchronous vs Asynchronous Reinforcement Learning in a Real World Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14554v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, reinforcement learning (RL) with physical robots has attracted the attention of a wide range of researchers. However, state-of-the-art RL algorithms do not consider that physical environments do not wait for the RL agent to make decisions or updates. RL agents learn by periodically conducting computationally expensive gradient updates. When decision-making and gradient update tasks are carried out sequentially by the RL agent in a physical robot, it significantly increases the agent's response time. In a rapidly changing environment, this increased response time may be detrimental to the performance of the learning agent. Asynchronous RL methods, which separate the computation of decision-making and gradient updates, are a potential solution to this problem. However, only a few comparisons between asynchronous and synchronous RL have been made with physical robots. For this reason, the exact performance benefits of using asynchronous RL methods over synchronous RL methods are still unclear. In this study, we provide a performance comparison between asynchronous and synchronous RL using a physical robotic arm called Franka Emika Panda. Our experiments show that the agents learn faster and attain significantly more returns using asynchronous RL. Our experiments also demonstrate that the learning agent with a faster response time performs better than the agent with a slower response time, even if the agent with a slower response time performs a higher number of gradient updates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Alberta Robotics & Intelligent Systems Expo (RISE) Conference</p></details> |

While safety-critical control techniques, such as Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), have been proposed to ensure safety, their effectiveness relies on the assumption that the robot has complete knowledge of its surroundings. In reality, robots often operate with restricted field-of-view and finite sensing range, which can lead to collisions with unknown obstacles if the planner is agnostic to these limitations. To address this issue, we introduce the Visibility-Aware RRT* algorithm that combines sampling-based planning with CBFs to generate safe and efficient global reference paths in partially unknown environments. The algorithm incorporates a collision avoidance CBF and a novel visibility CBF, which guarantees that the robot remains within locally collision-free regions, enabling timely detection and avoidance of unknown obstacles. We conduct extensive experiments interfacing the path planners with two different safety-critical controllers, wherein our method outperforms all other compared baselines across both safety and efficiency aspects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (to be presented at IROS 2025).

Foam provides a robust preprocessing pipeline to handle mesh defects and a number of configuration parameters to control the level and approximation of the spherization, and generates an output URDF with collision geometry specified only by spheres. We demonstrate Foam on a number of standard robot models on common tasks, and demonstrate improved collision checking and distance query performance with only a minor loss in fidelity compared to the true collision geometry.

However, existing surgeon consoles are bulky, take up valuable space in the operating room, make surgical team coordination challenging, and their proprietary nature makes it difficult to take advantage of recent technological advances, especially in virtual and augmented reality. One potential area for further improvement is the integration of modern sensory gloves into robotic platforms, allowing surgeons to control robotic arms intuitively with their hand movements. We propose one such system that combines an HTC Vive tracker, a Manus Meta Prime 3 XR sensory glove, and SCOPEYE wireless smart glasses. The system controls one arm of a da Vinci surgical robot. In addition to moving the arm, the surgeon can use fingers to control the end-effector of the surgical instrument. Hand gestures are used to implement clutching and similar functions. In particular, we introduce clutching of the instrument orientation, a functionality unavailable in the da Vinci system. The vibrotactile elements of the glove are used to provide feedback to the user when gesture commands are invoked. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation has been conducted that compares the current device with the dVRK console. The system is shown to have excellent tracking accuracy, and the new interface allows surgeons to perform common surgical training tasks with minimal practice efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables, submitted to International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents a modular robotic system in which each module has independent actuation, battery power, and control, allowing both individual mobility and coordinated locomotion. A hierarchical Central Pattern Generator (CPG) framework governs motion, with a low-level CPG controlling individual modules and a high-level CPG synchronizing inter-module coordination, enabling smooth transitions between independent and collective behaviors. To validate the system, we conduct simulations in MuJoCo and hardware experiments, evaluating locomotion across different configurations. We first analyze single-module motion, followed by two-module cooperative locomotion. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CPG-based control framework in achieving robust, flexible, and scalable locomotion. The proposed modular architecture has potential applications in search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and autonomous exploration, where adaptability and reconfigurability are essential.</p></details> |  |

To improve the quality of these candidates, our framework first translates the symbolic representations of the environment and controllers into natural language descriptions. If a candidate fails the verification, INPROVF provides feedback on potential unsafe behaviors or unsatisfied tasks, and iteratively prompts LLMs to generate improved solutions.

Analyzing data from 42 participants at SIGDIAL 2024, we extracted linguistic features such as disfluencies and syntactic complexity from conversation transcripts. The results showed moderate effect sizes, suggesting that participants produced fewer disfluencies and employed more complex syntax when interacting with ERICA. Further analysis involving training classification models like Na\"ive Bayes, which achieved an F1-score of 71.60\%, and conducting feature importance analysis, highlighted the significant role of disfluencies and syntactic complexity in interactions with robots of varying human-like appearances. Discussing these findings within the frameworks of cognitive load and Communication Accommodation Theory, we conclude that designing robots to elicit more structured and fluent user speech can enhance their communicative alignment with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as Late-Breaking Work at CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA '25)</p></details> |

Traditional methods, such as robot-centric reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning, and hybrid techniques, require massive training and often struggle to generalize across different objects and robot platforms. We propose a novel framework for learning object-centric manipulation policies in force space, decoupling the robot from the object. By directly applying forces to selected regions of the object, our method simplifies the action space, reduces unnecessary exploration, and decreases simulation overhead. This approach, trained in simulation on a small set of representative objects, captures object dynamics -- such as joint configurations -- allowing policies to generalize effectively to new, unseen objects. Decoupling these policies from robot-specific dynamics enables direct transfer to different robotic platforms (e.g., Kinova, Panda, UR5) without retraining. Our evaluations demonstrate that the method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in training efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, operating in force space enhances policy transferability across diverse robot platforms and object types. We further showcase the applicability of our method in a real-world robotic setting.

Our approach employs a conditional U-Net architecture enhanced with FiLM-based global conditioning, which iteratively denoises noisy action sequences into smooth, high-dimensional trajectories. To achieve precise key execution coupled with expressive musical performance, we design a composite reward function that integrates task-specific accuracy, audio fidelity, and high-level semantic feedback from a large language model (LLM) oracle. The LLM oracle assesses musical expressiveness and stylistic nuances, enabling dynamic, hand-specific reward adjustments. Further augmented by a residual inverse-kinematics refinement policy, PANDORA achieves state-of-the-art performance in the ROBOPIANIST environment, significantly outperforming baselines in both precision and expressiveness. Ablation studies validate the critical contributions of diffusion-based denoising and LLM-driven semantic feedback in enhancing robotic musicianship.

| **[Artificial Spacetimes for Reactive Control of Resource-Limited Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13355v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Field-based reactive control provides a minimalist, decentralized route to guiding robots that lack onboard computation. Such schemes are well suited to resource-limited machines like microrobots, yet implementation artifacts, limited behaviors, and the frequent lack of formal guarantees blunt adoption. Here, we address these challenges with a new geometric approach called artificial spacetimes. We show that reactive robots navigating control fields obey the same dynamics as light rays in general relativity. This surprising connection allows us to adopt techniques from relativity and optics for constructing and analyzing control fields. When implemented, artificial spacetimes guide robots around structured environments, simultaneously avoiding boundaries and executing tasks like rallying or sorting, even when the field itself is static. We augment these capabilities with formal tools for analyzing what robots will do and provide experimental validation with silicon-based microrobots. Combined, this work provides a new framework for generating composed robot behaviors with minimal overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, current gaze-based assistive systems mainly help users with basic grasping actions, offering limited support. Moreover, the restricted intent recognition capability constrains the assistive system's ability to provide diverse assistance functions. In this paper, we propose an open implicit intention recognition framework powered by Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Foundation Model (VFM), which can process gaze input and recognize user intents that are not confined to predefined or specific scenarios. Furthermore, we implement a gaze-driven LLM-enhanced assistive robot system (MindEye-OmniAssist) that recognizes user's intentions through gaze and assists in completing task. To achieve this, the system utilizes open vocabulary object detector, intention recognition network and LLM to infer their full intentions. By integrating eye movement feedback and LLM, it generates action sequences to assist the user in completing tasks. Real-world experiments have been conducted for assistive tasks, and the system achieved an overall success rate of 41/55 across various undefined tasks. Preliminary results show that the proposed method holds the potential to provide a more user-friendly human-computer interaction interface and significantly enhance the versatility and effectiveness of assistive systems by supporting more complex and diverse task.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the application of vision transformer models, namely ViT (Vision Transformers) and BEiT (BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers) pipelines, for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) in HRI. The focus is to generalize the SER models for individual speech characteristics by fine-tuning these models on benchmark datasets and exploiting ensemble methods. For this purpose, we collected audio data from different human subjects having pseudo-naturalistic conversations with the NAO robot. We then fine-tuned our ViT and BEiT-based models and tested these models on unseen speech samples from the participants. In the results, we show that fine-tuning vision transformers on benchmark datasets and and then using either these already fine-tuned models or ensembling ViT/BEiT models gets us the highest classification accuracies per individual when it comes to identifying four primary emotions from their speech: neutral, happy, sad, and angry, as compared to fine-tuning vanilla-ViTs or BEiTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Online Signature Verification based on the Lagrange formulation with 2D and 3D robotic models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13573v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online Signature Verification commonly relies on function-based features, such as time-sampled horizontal and vertical coordinates, as well as the pressure exerted by the writer, obtained through a digitizer. Although inferring additional information about the writers arm pose, kinematics, and dynamics based on digitizer data can be useful, it constitutes a challenge. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing a new set of features based on the dynamics of online signatures. These new features are inferred through a Lagrangian formulation, obtaining the sequences of generalized coordinates and torques for 2D and 3D robotic arm models. By combining kinematic and dynamic robotic features, our results demonstrate their significant effectiveness for online automatic signature verification and achieving state-of-the-art results when integrated into deep learning models.</p></details> |  |

Current methods require exact state measurements in order to enforce safety and liveness e.g. via control barrier functions (CBFs), which is challenging to achieve directly from onboard sensors like lidars and cameras. This work introduces LIVEPOINT, a decentralized control framework that synthesizes universal CBFs over point clouds to enable safe, deadlock-free real-time multi-robot navigation in dynamic, cluttered environments. Further, LIVEPOINT ensures minimally invasive deadlock avoidance behavior by dynamically adjusting agents' speeds based on a novel symmetric interaction metric. We validate our approach in simulation experiments across highly constrained multi-robot scenarios like doorways and intersections. Results demonstrate that LIVEPOINT achieves zero collisions or deadlocks and a 100% success rate in challenging settings compared to optimization-based baselines such as MPC and ORCA and neural methods such as MPNet, which fail in such environments. Despite prioritizing safety and liveness, LIVEPOINT is 35% smoother than baselines in the doorway environment, and maintains agility in constrained environments while still being safe and deadlock-free.</p></details> |  |
| **[Free-form language-based robotic reasoning and grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13082v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing robotic grasping from a cluttered bin based on human instructions is a challenging task, as it requires understanding both the nuances of free-form language and the spatial relationships between objects. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data, such as GPT-4o, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across both text and images. But can they truly be used for this task in a zero-shot setting? And what are their limitations? In this paper, we explore these research questions via the free-form language-based robotic grasping task, and propose a novel method, FreeGrasp, leveraging the pre-trained VLMs' world knowledge to reason about human instructions and object spatial arrangements. Our method detects all objects as keypoints and uses these keypoints to annotate marks on images, aiming to facilitate GPT-4o's zero-shot spatial reasoning. This allows our method to determine whether a requested object is directly graspable or if other objects must be grasped and removed first. Since no existing dataset is specifically designed for this task, we introduce a synthetic dataset FreeGraspData by extending the MetaGraspNetV2 dataset with human-annotated instructions and ground-truth grasping sequences. We conduct extensive analyses with both FreeGraspData and real-world validation with a gripper-equipped robotic arm, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in grasp reasoning and execution.

| **[Robot Skin with Touch and Bend Sensing using Electrical Impedance Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13048v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flexible electronic skins that simultaneously sense touch and bend are desired in several application areas, such as to cover articulated robot structures. This paper introduces a flexible tactile sensor based on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), capable of simultaneously detecting and measuring contact forces and flexion of the sensor. The sensor integrates a magnetic hydrogel composite and utilizes EIT to reconstruct internal conductivity distributions. Real-time estimation is achieved through the one-step Gauss-Newton method, which dynamically updates reference voltages to accommodate sensor deformation. A convolutional neural network is employed to classify interactions, distinguishing between touch, bending, and idle states using pre-reconstructed images. Experimental results demonstrate an average touch localization error of 5.4 mm (SD 2.2 mm) and average bending angle estimation errors of 1.9$^\circ$ (SD 1.6$^\circ$). The proposed adaptive reference method effectively distinguishes between single- and multi-touch scenarios while compensating for deformation effects. This makes the sensor a promising solution for multimodal sensing in robotics and human-robot collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Learning Enables Robot Action Prediction in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12782v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success using in-context learning (ICL) in the language domain. However, leveraging the ICL capabilities within LLMs to directly predict robot actions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RoboPrompt, a framework that enables off-the-shelf text-only LLMs to directly predict robot actions through ICL without training. Our approach first heuristically identifies keyframes that capture important moments from an episode. Next, we extract end-effector actions from these keyframes as well as the estimated initial object poses, and both are converted into textual descriptions. Finally, we construct a structured template to form ICL demonstrations from these textual descriptions and a task instruction. This enables an LLM to directly predict robot actions at test time. Through extensive experiments and analysis, RoboPrompt shows stronger performance over zero-shot and ICL baselines in simulated and real-world settings.

In practical situations of limited satellite signals or poor lighting conditions, navigation depends only on inertial sensors. In such cases, the navigation solution rapidly drifts due to inertial measurement errors. In this work, we propose WMINet a wheel-mounted inertial deep learning approach to estimate the mobile robot's position based only on its inertial sensors. To that end, we merge two common practical methods to reduce inertial drift: a wheel-mounted approach and driving the mobile robot in periodic trajectories. Additionally, we enforce a wheelbase constraint to further improve positioning performance. To evaluate our proposed approach we recorded using the Rosbot-XL a wheel-mounted initial dataset totaling 190 minutes, which is made publicly available. Our approach demonstrated a 66\% improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. As a consequence, our approach enables navigation in challenging environments and bridges the pure inertial gap. This enables seamless robot navigation using only inertial sensors for short periods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effective Utilization of Mixed-Quality Demonstrations in Robotic Manipulation via Segment-Level Selection and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19917v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data is crucial for robotic manipulation, as it underpins the development of robotic systems for complex tasks. While high-quality, diverse datasets enhance the performance and adaptability of robotic manipulation policies, collecting extensive expert-level data is resource-intensive. Consequently, many current datasets suffer from quality inconsistencies due to operator variability, highlighting the need for methods to utilize mixed-quality data effectively. To mitigate these issues, we propose "Select Segments to Imitate" (S2I), a framework that selects and optimizes mixed-quality demonstration data at the segment level, while ensuring plug-and-play compatibility with existing robotic manipulation policies. The framework has three components: demonstration segmentation dividing origin data into meaningful segments, segment selection using contrastive learning to find high-quality segments, and trajectory optimization to refine suboptimal segments for better policy learning. We evaluate S2I through comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments across six tasks, demonstrating that with only 3 expert demonstrations for reference, S2I can improve the performance of various downstream policies when trained with mixed-quality demonstrations.

| **[Robot Policy Transfer with Online Demonstrations: An Active Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12993v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer Learning (TL) is a powerful tool that enables robots to transfer learned policies across different environments, tasks, or embodiments. To further facilitate this process, efforts have been made to combine it with Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) for more flexible and efficient policy transfer. However, these approaches are almost exclusively limited to offline demonstrations collected before policy transfer starts, which may suffer from the intrinsic issue of covariance shift brought by LfD and harm the performance of policy transfer. Meanwhile, extensive work in the learning-from-scratch setting has shown that online demonstrations can effectively alleviate covariance shift and lead to better policy performance with improved sample efficiency. This work combines these insights to introduce online demonstrations into a policy transfer setting. We present Policy Transfer with Online Demonstrations, an active LfD algorithm for policy transfer that can optimize the timing and content of queries for online episodic expert demonstrations under a limited demonstration budget. We evaluate our method in eight robotic scenarios, involving policy transfer across diverse environment characteristics, task objectives, and robotic embodiments, with the aim to transfer a trained policy from a source task to a related but different target task. The results show that our method significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of average success rate and sample efficiency, compared to two canonical LfD methods with offline demonstrations and one active LfD method with online demonstrations. Additionally, we conduct preliminary sim-to-real tests of the transferred policy on three transfer scenarios in the real-world environment, demonstrating the policy effectiveness on a real robot manipulator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prof. Robot: Differentiable Robot Rendering Without Static and Self-Collisions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11269v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable rendering has gained significant attention in the field of robotics, with differentiable robot rendering emerging as an effective paradigm for learning robotic actions from image-space supervision. However, the lack of physical world perception in this approach may lead to potential collisions during action optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel improvement on previous efforts by incorporating physical awareness of collisions through the learning of a neural robotic collision classifier. This enables the optimization of actions that avoid collisions with static, non-interactable environments as well as the robot itself. To facilitate effective gradient optimization with the classifier, we identify the underlying issue and propose leveraging Eikonal regularization to ensure consistent gradients for optimization. Our solution can be seamlessly integrated into existing differentiable robot rendering frameworks, utilizing gradients for optimization and providing a foundation for future applications of differentiable rendering in robotics with improved reliability of interactions with the physical world. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our method compared to previous solutions.</p></details> |  |

However, there are few explorations for these foundation models used in quadruped robot navigation through terrains in 3D environments. In this work, we introduce SARO (Space Aware Robot System for Terrain Crossing), an innovative system composed of a high-level reasoning module, a closed-loop sub-task execution module, and a low-level control policy. It enables the robot to navigate across 3D terrains and reach the goal position. For high-level reasoning and execution, we propose a novel algorithmic system taking advantage of a VLM, with a design of task decomposition and a closed-loop sub-task execution mechanism. For low-level locomotion control, we utilize the Probability Annealing Selection (PAS) method to effectively train a control policy by reinforcement learning. Numerous experiments show that our whole system can accurately and robustly navigate across several 3D terrains, and its generalization ability ensures the applications in diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios and terrains.

Moreover, finding the exact optimal solution for multi-robot task allocation is NP-hard, resulting in significant computational time consumption. To address these issues, we present a hierarchical multi-robot exploration framework using a new modeling method called RegionGraph. The proposed approach makes two main contributions: 1) A new modeling method for unexplored areas that preserves their spatial information across the entire space in a weighted graph called RegionGraph. 2) A hierarchical multi-robot exploration framework that decomposes the global exploration task into smaller subtasks, reducing the frequency of global planning and enabling asynchronous exploration. The proposed method is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating a 20% improvement in efficiency compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Imperfect Demonstrations with Self-Supervision for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08957v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving data utilization, especially for imperfect data from task failures, is crucial for robotic manipulation due to the challenging, time-consuming, and expensive data collection process in the real world. Current imitation learning (IL) typically discards imperfect data, focusing solely on successful expert data. While reinforcement learning (RL) can learn from explorations and failures, the sim2real gap and its reliance on dense reward and online exploration make it difficult to apply effectively in real-world scenarios. In this work, we aim to conquer the challenge of leveraging imperfect data without the need for reward information to improve the model performance for robotic manipulation in an offline manner. Specifically, we introduce a Self-Supervised Data Filtering framework (SSDF) that combines expert and imperfect data to compute quality scores for failed trajectory segments. High-quality segments from the failed data are used to expand the training dataset. Then, the enhanced dataset can be used with any downstream policy learning method for robotic manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on the ManiSkill2 benchmark built on the high-fidelity Sapien simulator and real-world robotic manipulation tasks using the Franka robot arm demonstrated that the SSDF can accurately expand the training dataset with high-quality imperfect data and improve the success rates for all robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

The proposed system enables continuous power delivery to the capsule without the need for onboard batteries, thus extending operational time and reducing size constraints. The WPT system operates through a resonant inductive coupling mechanism, based on a transmitting coil mounted on the end effector of a robotic arm that also houses an external permanent magnet and a localization coil for precise capsule manipulation. To ensure robust and stable power transmission in the presence of coil misalignment and rotation, a 3D receiving coil is integrated within the capsule. Additionally, a closed-loop adaptive control system, based on load-shift keying (LSK) modulation, dynamically adjusts the transmitted power to optimize efficiency while maintaining compliance with specific absorption rate (SAR) safety limits. The system has been extensively characterized in laboratory settings and validated through in vivo experiments using a porcine model, demonstrating reliable power transfer and effective robotic navigation in realistic gastrointestinal conditions: the average received power was 110 mW at a distance of 9 cm between the coils, with variable capsule rotation angles. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposed WPT approach for autonomous, battery-free robotic capsule endoscopy, paving the way for enhanced diagnostic in gastrointestinal medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, regular paper</p></details> |

Next, we formulate a constrained optimization problem to decide both the task to be allocated to each robot as well as the mode in which the latter should execute the task. The robot modes are optimized based on the state of the robot and the environment, as well as the energy required to execute the allocated task. Moreover, the proposed framework is able to encompass kinematic and dynamic models of robots alike. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions for the convergence of task execution and allocation for both robot models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the T tracker achieves remarkable performance in both bright and dark scenes. Furthermore, results suggest that a tracker-switching approach using a binary brightness classifier is more suitable than a tracker-fusion approach for information integration. This study marks a crucial first step toward ``Dynamic-Dark SLAM," enabling effective recognition, understanding, and reconstruction of individuals, occluding objects, and traversable areas in dynamic environments, both bright and dark.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, technical report</p></details> |

This study aims to enforce robust cybersecurity constraints to mitigate the risks associated with data breaches, transaction fraud, and system manipulation. The background focuses on the rise of LLM-driven robotic systems in e-commerce, finance, and service industries, alongside the vulnerabilities they introduce. A novel security architecture combining blockchain technology with multi-factor authentication (MFA) and real-time anomaly detection was implemented to safeguard transactions. Key performance metrics such as transaction integrity, response time, and breach detection accuracy were evaluated, showing improved security and system performance. The results highlight that the proposed architecture reduced fraudulent transactions by 90%, improved breach detection accuracy to 98%, and ensured secure transaction validation within a latency of 0.05 seconds. These findings emphasize the importance of cybersecurity in the deployment of LLM-driven robotic systems and suggest a framework adaptable to various online platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Focusing Robot Open-Ended Reinforcement Learning Through Users' Purposes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12579v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Ended Learning (OEL) autonomous robots can acquire new skills and knowledge through direct interaction with their environment, relying on mechanisms such as intrinsic motivations and self-generated goals to guide learning processes. OEL robots are highly relevant for applications as they can autonomously leverage acquired knowledge to perform tasks beneficial to human users in unstructured environments, addressing challenges unforeseen at design time. However, OEL robots face a significant limitation: their openness may lead them to waste time learning information that is irrelevant to tasks desired by specific users. Here, we propose a solution called `Purpose-Directed Open-Ended Learning' (POEL), based on the novel concept of `purpose' introduced in previous work. A purpose specifies what users want the robot to achieve. The key insight of this work is that purpose can focus OEL on learning self-generated classes of tasks that, while unknown during autonomous learning (as typical in OEL), involve objects relevant to the purpose. This concept is operationalised in a novel robot architecture capable of receiving a human purpose through speech-to-text, analysing the scene to identify objects, and using a Large Language Model to reason about which objects are purpose-relevant. These objects are then used to bias OEL exploration towards their spatial proximity and to self-generate rewards that favour interactions with them. The solution is tested in a simulated scenario where a camera-arm-gripper robot interacts freely with purpose-related and distractor objects. For the first time, the results demonstrate the potential advantages of purpose-focused OEL over state-of-the-art OEL methods, enabling robots to handle unstructured environments while steering their learning toward knowledge acquisition relevant to users.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, accepted at RLDM 2025</p></details> |

However, when handling complex kitting tasks that involve fine-grained orientation alignment, existing approaches often suffer from limited accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Histogram Transporter, a novel kitting framework that learns high-precision pick-and-place actions from scratch using only a few demonstrations. First, our method extracts rotation-equivariant orientation histograms (EOHs) from visual observations using an efficient Fourier-based discretization strategy. These EOHs serve a dual purpose: improving picking efficiency by directly modeling action success probabilities over high-resolution orientations and enhancing placing accuracy by serving as local, discriminative feature descriptors for object-to-placement matching. Second, we introduce a subgroup alignment strategy in the place model that compresses the full spectrum of EOHs into a compact orientation representation, enabling efficient feature matching while preserving accuracy. Finally, we examine the proposed framework on the simulated Hand-Tool Kitting Dataset (HTKD), where it outperforms competitive baselines in both success rates and computational efficiency. Further experiments on five Raven-10 tasks exhibits the remarkable adaptability of our approach, with real-robot trials confirming its applicability for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under review</p></details> |

The inherent locomotion constraints of bipedal robots challenge their safe maneuvering capabilities in dynamic environments. When combined with the intricacies of social environments, including pedestrian interactions and social cues, such as emotions, these challenges become even more pronounced. To address these coupled problems, we propose a two-stage pipeline that considers both bipedal locomotion constraints and complex social environments. Specifically, social navigation scenarios are represented using sequential LiDAR grid maps (LGMs), from which we extract latent features, including collision regions, emotion-related discomfort zones, social interactions, and the spatio-temporal dynamics of evolving environments. The extracted features are directly mapped to the actions of reduced-order models (ROMs) through a DRL architecture. Furthermore, the proposed framework incorporates full-order dynamics and locomotion constraints during training, effectively accounting for tracking errors and restrictions of the locomotion controller while planning the trajectory with ROMs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach exceeds both model-based planners and DRL-based baselines.

Recent advances have made significant progress in high-level cognition with Foundation Models (FMs) and low-level skill development for humanoid robots. However, directly combining these components often results in poor robustness and efficiency due to compounding errors in long-horizon tasks and the varied latency of different modules. We introduce Being-0, a hierarchical agent framework that integrates an FM with a modular skill library. The FM handles high-level cognitive tasks such as instruction understanding, task planning, and reasoning, while the skill library provides stable locomotion and dexterous manipulation for low-level control. To bridge the gap between these levels, we propose a novel Connector module, powered by a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). The Connector enhances the FM's embodied capabilities by translating language-based plans into actionable skill commands and dynamically coordinating locomotion and manipulation to improve task success. With all components, except the FM, deployable on low-cost onboard computation devices, Being-0 achieves efficient, real-time performance on a full-sized humanoid robot equipped with dexterous hands and active vision. Extensive experiments in large indoor environments demonstrate Being-0's effectiveness in solving complex, long-horizon tasks that require challenging navigation and manipulation subtasks.

The proposed models form a foundation for data-driven world models capable of simulating the biomechanical interactions and procedural dynamics of surgical suturing with high temporal fidelity. Annotating a dataset of $\sim2K$ clips extracted from simulation videos, we categorize surgical actions into fine-grained sub-stitch classes including ideal and non-ideal executions of needle positioning, targeting, driving, and withdrawal. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art video diffusion models, LTX-Video and HunyuanVideo, to generate high-fidelity surgical action sequences at $\ge$768x512 resolution and $\ge$49 frames. For training our models, we explore both Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and full-model fine-tuning approaches. Our experimental results demonstrate that these world models can effectively capture the dynamics of suturing, potentially enabling improved training simulators, surgical skill assessment tools, and autonomous surgical systems. The models also display the capability to differentiate between ideal and non-ideal technique execution, providing a foundation for building surgical training and evaluation systems. We release our models for testing and as a foundation for future research. Project Page: https://mkturkcan.github.io/suturingmodels/</p></details> |  |

However, they risk failing catastrophically when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) situations. Several approaches have employed a type of synaptic plasticity known as Hebbian learning that can dynamically adjust weights based on local neural activities. Research has shown that synaptic plasticity can make policies more robust and help them adapt to unforeseen changes in the environment. However, networks augmented with Hebbian learning can lead to weight divergence, resulting in network instability. Furthermore, such Hebbian networks have not yet been applied to solve legged locomotion in complex real robots with many degrees of freedom. In this work, we improve the Hebbian network with a weight normalization mechanism for preventing weight divergence, analyze the principal components of the Hebbian's weights, and perform a thorough evaluation of network performance in locomotion control for real 18-DOF dung beetle-like and 16-DOF gecko-like robots. We find that the Hebbian-based plastic network can execute zero-shot sim-to-real adaptation locomotion and generalize to unseen conditions, such as uneven terrain and morphological damage.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, advancements in LiDAR technology have made sensors more accurate, lightweight, and cost-effective. Therefore, researchers increasingly integrate sensors, for SLAM studies, providing robust technical support for ground robots and expanding their application domains. Public datasets are essential for advancing SLAM technology. However, existing datasets for ground robots are typically restricted to flat-terrain motion with 3 DOF and cover only a limited range of scenarios. Although handheld devices and UAV exhibit richer and more aggressive movements, their datasets are predominantly confined to small-scale environments due to endurance limitations. To fill these gap, we introduce M2UD, a multi-modal, multi-scenario, uneven-terrain SLAM dataset for ground robots. This dataset contains a diverse range of highly challenging environments, including cities, open fields, long corridors, and mixed scenarios. Additionally, it presents extreme weather conditions. The aggressive motion and degradation characteristics of this dataset not only pose challenges for testing and evaluating existing SLAM methods but also advance the development of more advanced SLAM algorithms. To benchmark SLAM algorithms, M2UD provides smoothed ground truth localization data obtained via RTK and introduces a novel localization evaluation metric that considers both accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we utilize a high-precision laser scanner to acquire ground truth maps of two representative scenes, facilitating the development and evaluation of mapping algorithms. We select 12 localization sequences and 2 mapping sequences to evaluate several classical SLAM algorithms, verifying usability of the dataset. To enhance usability, the dataset is accompanied by a suite of development kits.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Language-Guided Object-Centric Diffusion Policy for Generalizable and Collision-Aware Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00451v3)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from demonstrations faces challenges in generalizing beyond the training data and often lacks collision awareness. This paper introduces Lan-o3dp, a language-guided object-centric diffusion policy framework that can adapt to unseen situations such as cluttered scenes, shifting camera views, and ambiguous similar objects while offering training-free collision avoidance and achieving a high success rate with few demonstrations. We train a diffusion model conditioned on 3D point clouds of task-relevant objects to predict the robot's end-effector trajectories, enabling it to complete the tasks. During inference, we incorporate cost optimization into denoising steps to guide the generated trajectory to be collision-free. We leverage open-set segmentation to obtain the 3D point clouds of related objects. We use a large language model to identify the target objects and possible obstacles by interpreting the user's natural language instructions. To effectively guide the conditional diffusion model using a time-independent cost function, we proposed a novel guided generation mechanism based on the estimated clean trajectories. In the simulation, we showed that diffusion policy based on the object-centric 3D representation achieves a much higher success rate (68.7%) compared to baselines with simple 2D (39.3%) and 3D scene (43.6%) representations across 21 challenging RLBench tasks with only 40 demonstrations. In real-world experiments, we extensively evaluated the generalization in various unseen situations and validated the effectiveness of the proposed zero-shot cost-guided collision avoidance.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

However, existing models primarily provide simple structured answers and struggle with complex scenarios due to their limited capability in recognizing long-range dependencies and aligning multimodal information. In this paper, we introduce Surgical-LVLM, a novel personalized large vision-language model tailored for complex surgical scenarios. Leveraging the pre-trained large vision-language model and specialized Visual Perception LoRA (VP-LoRA) blocks, our model excels in understanding complex visual-language tasks within surgical contexts. In addressing the visual grounding task, we propose the Token-Interaction (TIT) module, which strengthens the interaction between the grounding module and the language responses of the Large Visual Language Model (LVLM) after projecting them into the latent space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Surgical-LVLM on several benchmarks, including EndoVis-17-VQLA, EndoVis-18-VQLA, and a newly introduced EndoVis Conversations dataset, which sets new performance standards. Our work contributes to advancing the field of automated surgical mentorship by providing a context-aware solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is accepted by ICLR 2025 FM-Wild Workshop</p></details> |

This work addresses these challenges by introducing a novel method for pre-training with multi-modal human demonstrations. Our approach jointly learns inverse and forward dynamics to extract latent state representations, towards learning manipulation specific representations. This enables efficient fine-tuning with only a small number of robot demonstrations, significantly improving data efficiency. Furthermore, our method allows for the use of multi-modal data, such as combination of vision and touch for manipulation. By leveraging latent dynamics modeling and tactile sensing, this approach paves the way for scalable robot manipulation learning based on human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, submission to RSS 2025</p></details> |

By explicitly deriving these improved parameterizations from a generalized Clarke transformation matrix, we unify various approaches into one comprehensive mathematical framework. This unified representation provides clarity regarding their relationships and generalizes them beyond existing constraints, including arbitrary joint numbers, joint distributions, and underlying modeling assumptions.

| **[GenOSIL: Generalized Optimal and Safe Robot Control using Parameter-Conditioned Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12243v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safe and generalizable control remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, particularly when deploying imitation learning in dynamic environments. Traditional behavior cloning (BC) struggles to generalize beyond its training distribution, as it lacks an understanding of the safety critical reasoning behind expert demonstrations. To address this limitation, we propose GenOSIL, a novel imitation learning framework that explicitly incorporates environment parameters into policy learning via a structured latent representation. Unlike conventional methods that treat the environment as a black box, GenOSIL employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode measurable safety parameters such as obstacle position, velocity, and geometry into a latent space that captures intrinsic correlations between expert behavior and environmental constraints. This enables the policy to infer the rationale behind expert trajectories rather than merely replicating them. We validate our approach on two robotic platforms an autonomous ground vehicle and a Franka Emika Panda manipulator demonstrating superior safety and goal reaching performance compared to baseline methods. The simulation and hardware videos can be viewed on the project webpage: https://mumukshtayal.github.io/GenOSIL/.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[D4orm: Multi-Robot Trajectories with Dynamics-aware Diffusion Denoised Deformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12204v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents an optimization method for generating kinodynamically feasible and collision-free multi-robot trajectories that exploits an incremental denoising scheme in diffusion models. Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a score function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes the deformation from the previous round with this denoising process, allows \textit{anytime} refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI, approximately three times faster in a 3D holonomic case with 16 robots. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReBot: Scaling Robot Learning with Real-to-Sim-to-Real Robotic Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14526v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models present a promising paradigm by training policies directly on real robot datasets like Open X-Embodiment. However, the high cost of real-world data collection hinders further data scaling, thereby restricting the generalizability of VLAs. In this paper, we introduce ReBot, a novel real-to-sim-to-real approach for scaling real robot datasets and adapting VLA models to target domains, which is the last-mile deployment challenge in robot manipulation. Specifically, ReBot replays real-world robot trajectories in simulation to diversify manipulated objects (real-to-sim), and integrates the simulated movements with inpainted real-world background to synthesize physically realistic and temporally consistent robot videos (sim-to-real). Our approach has several advantages: 1) it enjoys the benefit of real data to minimize the sim-to-real gap; 2) it leverages the scalability of simulation; and 3) it can generalize a pretrained VLA to a target domain with fully automated data pipelines. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that ReBot significantly enhances the performance and robustness of VLAs. For example, in SimplerEnv with the WidowX robot, ReBot improved the in-domain performance of Octo by 7.2% and OpenVLA by 21.8%, and out-of-domain generalization by 19.9% and 9.4%, respectively. For real-world evaluation with a Franka robot, ReBot increased the success rates of Octo by 17% and OpenVLA by 20%.

This paper investigates E2E robot navigation in unstructured road environments. First, we introduce two data collection pipelines - one for real-world robot data and another for synthetic data generated using the Isaac Sim simulator, which together produce an unstructured robotics navigation dataset -- FreeWorld Dataset. Second, we fine-tuned an efficient E2E autonomous driving model -- VAD -- using our datasets to validate the performance and adaptability of E2E autonomous driving models in these environments. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning through our datasets significantly enhances the navigation potential of E2E autonomous driving models in unstructured robotic environments. Thus, this paper presents the first dataset targeting E2E robot navigation tasks in unstructured scenarios, and provides a benchmark based on vision-based E2E autonomous driving algorithms to facilitate the development of E2E navigation technology for logistics and service robots.

| **[ICCO: Learning an Instruction-conditioned Coordinator for Language-guided Task-aligned Multi-robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12122v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have permitted the development of language-guided multi-robot systems, which allow robots to execute tasks based on natural language instructions. However, achieving effective coordination in distributed multi-agent environments remains challenging due to (1) misalignment between instructions and task requirements and (2) inconsistency in robot behaviors when they independently interpret ambiguous instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Instruction-Conditioned Coordinator (ICCO), a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework designed to enhance coordination in language-guided multi-robot systems. ICCO consists of a Coordinator agent and multiple Local Agents, where the Coordinator generates Task-Aligned and Consistent Instructions (TACI) by integrating language instructions with environmental states, ensuring task alignment and behavioral consistency. The Coordinator and Local Agents are jointly trained to optimize a reward function that balances task efficiency and instruction following. A Consistency Enhancement Term is added to the learning objective to maximize mutual information between instructions and robot behaviors, further improving coordination. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ICCO in achieving language-guided task-aligned multi-robot control.

The proposed state estimator builds upon our previous work presented in [1]. It integrates data from a range of onboard sensors, including IMUs, encoders, cameras, and LiDARs, to deliver a comprehensive and reliable estimation of the robot's pose and motion, even in slippery scenarios. We tested MUSE on a Unitree Aliengo robot, successfully closing the locomotion control loop in difficult scenarios, including slippery and uneven terrain.
