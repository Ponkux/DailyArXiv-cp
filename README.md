| **[A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14093v4)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI is widely recognized as a key element of artificial general intelligence because it involves controlling embodied agents to perform tasks in the physical world. Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |
| **[From Screens to Scenes: A Survey of Embodied AI in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07468v3)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare systems worldwide face persistent challenges in efficiency, accessibility, and personalization. Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 11 figures, manuscript accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |
| **[SPA: 3D Spatial-Awareness Enables Effective Embodied Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08208v3)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce SPA, a novel representation learning framework that emphasizes the importance of 3D spatial awareness in embodied AI. Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

| **[3D-Mem: 3D Scene Memory for Embodied Exploration and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17735v4)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing compact and informative 3D scene representations is essential for effective embodied exploration and reasoning, especially in complex environments over extended periods. Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[ManiSkill-HAB: A Benchmark for Low-Level Manipulation in Home Rearrangement Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13211v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality benchmarks are the foundation for embodied AI research, enabling significant advancements in long-horizon navigation, manipulation and rearrangement tasks. However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of prior magical grasp implementations at a fraction of the GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping Language-Guided Navigation Learning with Self-Refining Data Flywheel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08467v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating high-quality data for training robust language-instructed agents is a long-lasting challenge in embodied AI. In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |
| **[OpenFly: A Versatile Toolchain and Large-scale Benchmark for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents through an environment by leveraging both language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust and Secure Embodied AI: A Survey on Vulnerabilities and Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13175v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, including robots and autonomous vehicles, are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, where they encounter a range of vulnerabilities stemming from both environmental and system-level factors. These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConsistentDreamer: View-Consistent Meshes Through Balanced Multi-View Gaussian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09278v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved 3D generation, enabling the use of assets generated from an image for embodied AI simulations. However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Pattern Recognition Letters.

| **[MapNav: A Novel Memory Representation via Annotated Semantic Maps for VLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13451v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a key task in Embodied AI, requiring agents to navigate diverse and unseen environments while following natural language instructions. Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defining and Evaluating Visual Language Models' Basic Spatial Abilities: A Perspective from Psychometrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11859v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Theory of Multiple Intelligences underscores the hierarchical nature of cognitive capabilities. To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[MindForge: Empowering Embodied Agents with Theory of Mind for Lifelong Collaborative Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12977v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs), such as Voyager, have shown promising capabilities in individual learning within open-ended environments like Minecraft. However, when powered by open LLMs, they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a multicomponent memory system. In Minecraft experiments, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks where traditional Voyager fails without GPT-4, collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items and achieving $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones, advancing from basic wood tools to advanced iron equipment. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated collaborative experiences. MindForge advances the democratization of embodied AI development through open-ended social learning, enabling peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sce2DriveX: A Generalized MLLM Framework for Scene-to-Drive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14917v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving, which directly maps raw sensor inputs to low-level vehicle controls, is an important part of Embodied AI. Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoFar: Language-Grounded Orientation Bridges Spatial Reasoning and Object Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13143v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence is a critical component of embodied AI, promoting robots to understand and interact with their environments. While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |
| **[Generative Multi-Agent Collaboration in Embodied AI: A Systematic Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11518v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied multi-agent systems (EMAS) have attracted growing attention for their potential to address complex, real-world challenges in areas such as logistics and robotics. Recent advances in foundation models pave the way for generative agents capable of richer communication and adaptive problem-solving. This survey provides a systematic examination of how EMAS can benefit from these generative capabilities. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes EMAS by system architectures and embodiment modalities, emphasizing how collaboration spans both physical and virtual contexts. Central building blocks, perception, planning, communication, and feedback, are then analyzed to illustrate how generative techniques bolster system robustness and flexibility. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the transformative effects of integrating foundation models into embodied, multi-agent frameworks. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions, underlining the significant promise of EMAS to reshape the landscape of AI-driven collaboration.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Object-Centric Latent Action Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09680v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging vast amounts of internet video data for Embodied AI is currently bottle-necked by the lack of action annotations and the presence of action-correlated distractors. We propose a novel object-centric latent action learning approach, based on VideoSaur and LAPO, that employs self-supervised decomposition of scenes into object representations and annotates video data with proxy-action labels. This method effectively disentangles causal agent-object interactions from irrelevant background noise and reduces the performance degradation of latent action learning approaches caused by distractors. Our preliminary experiments with the Distracting Control Suite show that latent action pretraining based on object decompositions improve the quality of inferred latent actions by x2.7 and efficiency of downstream fine-tuning with a small set of labeled actions, increasing return by x2.6 on average.</p></details> | Preprint.

| **[POEX: Understanding and Mitigating Policy Executable Jailbreak Attacks against Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16633v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems are rapidly evolving due to the integration of LLMs as planning modules, which transform complex instructions into executable policies. However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

These advancements have led to an explosive increase in the demand for computational power, challenging the limits of Moore's Law. Optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing, faces significant challenges due to its high costs. To address this, various lithography simulators have been developed. However, many of these simulators are limited by their inadequate photoresist modeling capabilities. This paper presents TorchResist, an open-source, differentiable photoresist simulator.TorchResist employs an analytical approach to model the photoresist process, functioning as a white-box system with at most twenty interpretable parameters. Leveraging modern differentiable programming techniques and parallel computing on GPUs, TorchResist enables seamless co-optimization with other tools across multiple related tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that TorchResist achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing solutions.

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[LSceneLLM: Enhancing Large 3D Scene Understanding Using Adaptive Visual Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01292v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on 3D Vision-Language Models (3D-VLMs) is gaining increasing attention, which is crucial for developing embodied AI within 3D scenes, such as visual navigation and embodied question answering. Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefDrone: A Challenging Benchmark for Referring Expression Comprehension in Drone Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00392v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drones have become prevalent robotic platforms with diverse applications, showing significant potential in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI). Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code will be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Action Learning Requires Supervision in the Presence of Distractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00379v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | Preprint.

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |

This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions. This highlights the critical need for robust goal specification and safety frameworks before any physical implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected Version - Solved Some Issues with reference compilation by latex</p></details> |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

Nevertheless, the rapid development of MEANETs is accompanied by challenges in trustworthiness and operational efficiency. Fortunately, blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable characteristics, offers promising solutions for MEANETs. However, existing block propagation mechanisms suffer from challenges such as low propagation efficiency and weak security for block propagation, which results in delayed transmission of vehicular messages or vulnerability to malicious tampering, potentially causing severe traffic accidents in blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Moreover, current block propagation strategies cannot effectively adapt to real-time changes of dynamic topology in MEANETs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph Resfusion model-based trustworthy block propagation optimization framework for consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Specifically, we propose an innovative trust calculation mechanism based on the trust cloud model, which comprehensively accounts for randomness and fuzziness in the miner trust evaluation. Furthermore, by leveraging the strengths of graph neural networks and diffusion models, we develop a graph Resfusion model to effectively and adaptively generate the optimal block propagation trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other routing mechanisms in terms of block propagation efficiency and trustworthiness. Additionally, the results highlight its strong adaptability to dynamic environments, making it particularly suitable for rapidly changing MEANETs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</p></details> | Website: GenEx.world |

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

However, a standardized, closed-loop benchmark for evaluating their spatial reasoning and sequential decision-making capabilities is lacking. To address this, we present MetaVQA: a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess and enhance VLMs' understanding of spatial relationships and scene dynamics through Visual Question Answering (VQA) and closed-loop simulations. MetaVQA leverages Set-of-Mark prompting and top-down view ground-truth annotations from nuScenes and Waymo datasets to automatically generate extensive question-answer pairs based on diverse real-world traffic scenarios, ensuring object-centric and context-rich instructions. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with the MetaVQA dataset significantly improves their spatial reasoning and embodied scene comprehension in safety-critical simulations, evident not only in improved VQA accuracies but also in emerging safety-aware driving maneuvers. In addition, the learning demonstrates strong transferability from simulation to real-world observation.

However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks. This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context. Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior studies that explored this as long-form video understanding and utilized egocentric video only, we instead propose an LLM-based agent, Embodied VideoAgent, which constructs scene memory from both egocentric video and embodied sensory inputs (e.g. depth and pose sensing). We further introduce a VLM-based approach to automatically update the memory when actions or activities over objects are perceived. Embodied VideoAgent attains significant advantages over counterparts in challenging reasoning and planning tasks in 3D scenes, achieving gains of 4.9% on Ego4D-VQ3D, 5.8% on OpenEQA, and 11.7% on EnvQA.

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns.

The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment.

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV.

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods.

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments.

While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/</p></details> |

This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |
| **[SplatR : Experience Goal Visual Rearrangement with 3D Gaussian Splatting and Dense Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14322v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Experience Goal Visual Rearrangement task stands as a foundational challenge within Embodied AI, requiring an agent to construct a robust world model that accurately captures the goal state. The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |
| **[ON as ALC: Active Loop Closing Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11523v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In simultaneous localization and mapping, active loop closing (ALC) is an active vision problem that aims to visually guide a robot to maximize the chances of revisiting previously visited points, thereby resetting the drift errors accumulated in the incrementally built map during travel. However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Grasp What You Want: Embodied Dexterous Grasping System Driven by Your Voice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10694v1)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, as robotics has advanced, human-robot collaboration has gained increasing importance. However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task of embodied AI that requires the agent to find a target object in unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging as it demands both perceptual and cognitive processes for effective perception and decision-making. While perception has gained significant progress powered by the rapidly developed visual foundation models, the progress on the cognitive side remains limited to either implicitly learning from massive navigation demonstrations or explicitly leveraging pre-defined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that humans consistently update their cognitive states while searching for objects in unseen environments, we present CogNav, which attempts to model this cognitive process with the help of large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process with a finite state machine composed of cognitive states ranging from exploration to identification. The transitions between the states are determined by a large language model based on an online built heterogeneous cognitive map containing spatial and semantic information of the scene being explored. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world environments demonstrate that our cognitive modeling significantly improves ObjectNav efficiency, with human-like navigation behaviors. In an open-vocabulary and zero-shot setting, our method advances the SOTA of the HM3D benchmark from 69.3% to 87.2%. The code and data will be released.</p></details> |  |

The central case study is Jess+ an intelligent digital score system for shared creativity with a mixed ensemble of non-disabled and disabled musicians. The overarching aim is that the digital score enables disabled musicians to thrive in a live music conversation with other musicians regardless of the potential barriers of disability and music-making. After defining what we mean by embodied AI and how this approach supports the aims of the Jess+ project, we outline the main design features of the system. This includes several novel approaches such as its modular design, an AI Factory based on an embodied musicking dataset, and an embedded belief system. Our findings showed that the implemented design decisions and embodied-AI approach led to rich experiences for the musicians which in turn transformed their practice as an inclusive ensemble.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models in Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07904v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated a wide range of capabilities across many domains, including Embodied AI. In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfiniteWorld: A Unified Scalable Simulation Framework for General Visual-Language Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05789v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realizing scaling laws in embodied AI has become a focus. However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This study finds that state-of-the-art embodied AI agents compete for higher navigation quality, but often compromise the computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce "Skip-SCAR," an optimization framework that builds computationally and memory-efficient embodied AI agents to accomplish high-quality visual navigation tasks. Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint. Tested on the HM3D ObjectNav datasets and real-world physical hardware systems, Skip-SCAR not only minimizes hardware resources but also sets new performance benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of optimizing both navigation quality and computational efficiency for robotics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Privacy Risks in Reinforcement Learning for Household Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09273v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prominence of embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI), which empowers robots to navigate, perceive, and engage within virtual environments, has attracted significant attention, owing to the remarkable advances in computer vision and large language models. Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The system leverages multiple RGB-D cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |

Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

Despite recent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods often lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in scenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this paper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and scalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors and multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion (OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved surfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric fidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital twins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM-based planners are inefficient due to their large number of parameters and prone to inaccuracies because they operate in open-loop systems. We think the reason is that only applying LLMs as planners is insufficient. In this work, we propose DaDu-E, a robust closed-loop planning framework for embodied AI robots. Specifically, DaDu-E is equipped with a relatively lightweight LLM, a set of encapsulated robot skill instructions, a robust feedback system, and memory augmentation. Together, these components enable DaDu-E to (i) actively perceive and adapt to dynamic environments, (ii) optimize computational costs while maintaining high performance, and (iii) recover from execution failures using its memory and feedback mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world and simulated tasks show that DaDu-E achieves task success rates comparable to embodied AI robots with larger models as planners like COME-Robot, while reducing computational requirements by $6.6 \times$.

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters, connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and easy integration with downstream tasks.

| **[Right Place, Right Time! Generalizing ObjectNav to Dynamic Environments with Portable Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09905v2)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ObjectNav is a popular task in Embodied AI, where an agent navigates to a target object in an unseen environment. Prior literature makes the assumption of a static environment with stationary objects, which lacks realism. To address this, we present a novel formulation to generalize ObjectNav to dynamic environments with non-stationary objects, and refer to it as Portable ObjectNav or P-ObjectNav. In our formulation, we first address several challenging issues with dynamizing existing topological scene graphs by developing a novel method that introduces multiple transition behaviors to portable objects in the scene. We use this technique to dynamize Matterport3D, a popular simulator for evaluating embodied tasks. We then present a benchmark for P-ObjectNav using a combination of heuristic, reinforcement learning, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based navigation approaches on the dynamized environment, while introducing novel evaluation metrics tailored for our task. Our work fundamentally challenges the "static-environment" notion of prior ObjectNav work; the code and dataset for P-ObjectNav will be made publicly available to foster research on embodied navigation in dynamic scenes. We provide an anonymized repository for our code and dataset: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PObjectNav-1C6D.</p></details> | 19 |
| **[Learning Reward and Policy Jointly from Demonstration and Preference Improves Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06874v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for building contemporary foundation models and embodied AI. However, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning task. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant under-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward model and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment performance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated Human Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and demonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach admits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and leverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy Optimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment pipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with extensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially when the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[EARBench: Towards Evaluating Physical Risk Awareness for Task Planning of Foundation Model-based Embodied AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04449v5)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) integrates advanced AI models into physical entities for real-world interaction. The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EARBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EARDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downstream tasks. Image-to-video diffusion models are already capable of generating highly realistic synthetic videos. However, these models are not action-conditioned, and the most powerful models are closed-source which means they cannot be finetuned. In this work, we propose to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to action-conditioned world models, without access to the parameters of the pretrained model. Our approach, AVID, trains an adapter on a small domain-specific dataset of action-labelled videos. AVID uses a learned mask to modify the intermediate outputs of the pretrained model and generate accurate action-conditioned videos. We evaluate AVID on video game and real-world robotics data, and show that it outperforms existing baselines for diffusion model adaptation.1 Our results demonstrate that if utilized correctly, pretrained video models have the potential to be powerful tools for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/avid-world-model-adapters/home</p></details> |

In this study, we introduce ROOT, a VLM-based system designed to enhance the analysis of indoor scenes. Specifically, we first develop an iterative object perception algorithm using GPT-4V to detect object entities within indoor scenes. This is followed by employing vision foundation models to acquire additional meta-information about the scene, such as bounding boxes. Building on this foundational data, we propose a specialized VLM, SceneVLM, which is capable of generating spatial hierarchical scene graphs and providing distance information for objects within indoor environments. This information enhances our understanding of the spatial arrangement of indoor scenes. To train our SceneVLM, we collect over 610,000 images from various public indoor datasets and implement a scene data generation pipeline with a semi-automated technique to establish relationships and estimate distances among indoor objects. By utilizing this enriched data, we conduct various training recipes and finish SceneVLM. Our experiments demonstrate that \rootname facilitates indoor scene understanding and proves effective in diverse downstream applications, such as 3D scene generation and embodied AI.

| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs and 3D segmentation masks. In addition, we design MORE3D, a simple yet effective method that enables multi-object 3D reasoning segmentation with user questions and textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative World Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

| **[Software-Hardware Co-Design For Embodied AI Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04292v4)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI robots have the potential to fundamentally improve the way human beings live and manufacture. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame-basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes Corki, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI robot control. Our idea is to decouple LLM inference, robotic control and data communication in the embodied AI robots compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, Corki predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. Corki largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to 8.0x, resulting in up to 3.6x speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 17.3%. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/hyy0613/Corki</p></details> |  |

Generated models frequently fail to maintain balance when placed in physics-based simulations or 3D printed. This balance is crucial for satisfying user design intentions in interactive gaming, embodied AI, and robotics, where stable models are needed for reliable interaction. Additionally, stable models ensure that 3D-printed objects, such as figurines for home decoration, can stand on their own without requiring additional supports. To fill this gap, we introduce Atlas3D, an automatic and easy-to-implement method that enhances existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D tools. Atlas3D ensures the generation of self-supporting 3D models that adhere to physical laws of stability under gravity, contact, and friction. Our approach combines a novel differentiable simulation-based loss function with physically inspired regularization, serving as either a refinement or a post-processing module for existing frameworks. We verify Atlas3D's efficacy through extensive generation tasks and validate the resulting 3D models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunuoch.github.io/Atlas3D/</p></details> |

Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing Architect, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene. This iterative structure brings the flexibility for our method to generate or refine scenes from various starting points, such as text, floor plans, or pre-arranged environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Models in Vision: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05902v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive modeling has been a huge success in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, \textit{i.e.}, pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the strategy of representation. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multi-faceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multi-modal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: \url{https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey}.</p></details> |  |

Scene Retrieval with Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14565v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interfaces to embodied AI are becoming more ubiquitous in our daily lives. This opens up further opportunities for language-based interaction with embodied agents, such as a user verbally instructing an agent to execute some task in a specific location. For example, "put the bowls back in the cupboard next to the fridge" or "meet me at the intersection under the red sign." As such, we need methods that interface between natural language and map representations of the environment. To this end, we explore the question of whether we can use an open-set natural language query to identify a scene represented by a 3D scene graph. We define this task as "language-based scene-retrieval" and it is closely related to "coarse-localization," but we are instead searching for a match from a collection of disjoint scenes and not necessarily a large-scale continuous map. We present Text2SceneGraphMatcher, a "scene-retrieval" pipeline that learns joint embeddings between text descriptions and scene graphs to determine if they are a match. The code, trained models, and datasets will be made public.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

However, current VLN frameworks often rely on static environments and optimal expert supervision, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation (HA-VLN), extending traditional VLN by incorporating dynamic human activities and relaxing key assumptions. We propose the Human-Aware 3D (HA3D) simulator, which combines dynamic human activities with the Matterport3D dataset, and the Human-Aware Room-to-Room (HA-R2R) dataset, extending R2R with human activity descriptions. To tackle HA-VLN challenges, we present the Expert-Supervised Cross-Modal (VLN-CM) and Non-Expert-Supervised Decision Transformer (VLN-DT) agents, utilizing cross-modal fusion and diverse training strategies for effective navigation in dynamic human environments. A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability. Ultimately, this work provides benchmarks and insights for future research on embodied AI and Sim2Real transfer, paving the way for more realistic and applicable VLN systems in human-populated environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight at NeurIPS 2024 D&B Track. 32 pages, 18 figures, Project Page: https://lpercc.github.io/HA3D_simulator/</p></details> |

Our system is modular: it deploys state of the art Large Language Models for task planning,Vision-Language models for semantic perception, and Point Cloud transformers for grasping. With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities. One may also in-place swap modules to improve the robustness of the overall platform, for instance with imitation-learned policies.

At present, many evaluation platforms with rich scenes, high visual fidelity and various application scenarios have been developed. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework named NeuronsGym that can be used for policy learning of robot tasks, covering a simulation platform for training policy, and a physical system for studying sim2real problems. Unlike most current single-task, slow-moving robotic platforms, our framework provides agile physical robots with a wider range of speeds, and can be employed to train robotic navigation and confrontation policies. At the same time, in order to evaluate the safety of robot navigation, we propose a safety-weighted path length (SFPL) to improve the safety evaluation in the current mobile robot navigation. Based on this platform, we build a new benchmark for navigation and confrontation tasks under this platform by comparing the current mainstream sim2real methods, and hold the 2022 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) RoboMaster sim2real challenge. We release the codes of this framework\footnote{\url{https://github.com/DRL-CASIA/NeuronsGym}} and hope that this platform can promote the development of more flexible and agile general mobile agent algorithms.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

One notably promising application of LLM agents is robotic manipulation. Recent research has shown that LLMs can generate text planning or control code for robots, providing substantial flexibility and interaction capabilities. However, these methods still face challenges in terms of flexibility and applicability across different environments, limiting their ability to adapt autonomously. Current approaches typically fall into two categories: those relying on environment-specific policy training, which restricts their transferability, and those generating code actions based on fixed prompts, which leads to diminished performance when confronted with new environments. These limitations significantly constrain the generalizability of agents in robotic manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called EnvBridge. This approach involves the retention and transfer of successful robot control codes from source environments to target environments. EnvBridge enhances the agent's adaptability and performance across diverse settings by leveraging insights from multiple environments. Notably, our approach alleviates environmental constraints, offering a more flexible and generalizable solution for robotic manipulation tasks. We validated the effectiveness of our method using robotic manipulation benchmarks: RLBench, MetaWorld, and CALVIN. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully leverage diverse knowledge sources to solve complex tasks. Consequently, our approach significantly enhances the adaptability and robustness of robotic manipulation agents in planning across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

When integrated into an embodied agent, existing embodied VLM works either output detailed action sequences at the manipulation level or only provide plans at an abstract level, leaving a gap between high-level planning and real-world manipulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octopus, an embodied vision-language programmer that uses executable code generation as a medium to connect planning and manipulation. Octopus is designed to 1) proficiently comprehend an agent's visual and textual task objectives, 2) formulate intricate action sequences, and 3) generate executable code. To facilitate Octopus model development, we introduce OctoVerse: a suite of environments tailored for benchmarking vision-based code generators on a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games such as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Minecraft. To train Octopus, we leverage GPT-4 to control an explorative agent that generates training data, i.e., action blueprints and corresponding executable code. We also collect feedback that enables an enhanced training scheme called Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate Octopus's functionality and present compelling results, showing that the proposed RLEF refines the agent's decision-making. By open-sourcing our simulation environments, dataset, and model architecture, we aspire to ignite further innovation and foster collaborative applications within the broader embodied AI community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://choiszt.github.io/Octopus/, Codebase: https://github.com/dongyh20/Octopus</p></details> |

More recently, multi-agent systems with LLM-based agents (Multi-LLM) have been utilized increasingly more for QA. In these scenarios, the models may each answer the question and reach a consensus or each model is specialized to answer different domain questions. However, most prior work dealing with Multi-LLM QA has focused on scenarios where the models are asked in a zero-shot manner or are given information sources to extract the answer. For question answering of an unknown environment, embodied exploration of the environment is first needed to answer the question. This skill is necessary for personalizing embodied AI to environments such as households. There is a lack of insight into whether a Multi-LLM system can handle question-answering based on observations from embodied exploration. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the use of Multi-Embodied LLM Explorers (MELE) for QA in an unknown environment. Multiple LLM-based agents independently explore and then answer queries about a household environment. We analyze different aggregation methods to generate a single, final answer for each query: debating, majority voting, and training a central answer module (CAM). Using CAM, we observe a $46\%$ higher accuracy compared against the other non-learning-based aggregation methods. We provide code and the query dataset for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Through this unified latent action space, IGOR enables knowledge transfer among large-scale robot and human activity data. We achieve this by compressing visual changes between an initial image and its goal state into latent actions. IGOR allows us to generate latent action labels for internet-scale video data. This unified latent action space enables the training of foundation policy and world models across a wide variety of tasks performed by both robots and humans. We demonstrate that: (1) IGOR learns a semantically consistent action space for both human and robots, characterizing various possible motions of objects representing the physical interaction knowledge; (2) IGOR can "migrate" the movements of the object in the one video to other videos, even across human and robots, by jointly using the latent action model and world model; (3) IGOR can learn to align latent actions with natural language through the foundation policy model, and integrate latent actions with a low-level policy model to achieve effective robot control. We believe IGOR opens new possibilities for human-to-robot knowledge transfer and control.</p></details> |  |

Building on previous work, EgoThink, we introduce VidEgoThink, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating egocentric video understanding capabilities. To bridge the gap between MLLMs and low-level control in Embodied AI, we design four key interrelated tasks: video question-answering, hierarchy planning, visual grounding and reward modeling. To minimize manual annotation costs, we develop an automatic data generation pipeline based on the Ego4D dataset, leveraging the prior knowledge and multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o. Three human annotators then filter the generated data to ensure diversity and quality, resulting in the VidEgoThink benchmark. We conduct extensive experiments with three types of models: API-based MLLMs, open-source image-based MLLMs, and open-source video-based MLLMs. Experimental results indicate that all MLLMs, including GPT-4o, perform poorly across all tasks related to egocentric video understanding. These findings suggest that foundation models still require significant advancements to be effectively applied to first-person scenarios in Embodied AI. In conclusion, VidEgoThink reflects a research trend towards employing MLLMs for egocentric vision, akin to human capabilities, enabling active observation and interaction in the complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation-a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation-remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[EgoChoir: Capturing 3D Human-Object Interaction Regions from Egocentric Views](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13659v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding egocentric human-object interaction (HOI) is a fundamental aspect of human-centric perception, facilitating applications like AR/VR and embodied AI. For the egocentric HOI, in addition to perceiving semantics e.g., ''what'' interaction is occurring, capturing ''where'' the interaction specifically manifests in 3D space is also crucial, which links the perception and operation. Existing methods primarily leverage observations of HOI to capture interaction regions from an exocentric view. However, incomplete observations of interacting parties in the egocentric view introduce ambiguity between visual observations and interaction contents, impairing their efficacy. From the egocentric view, humans integrate the visual cortex, cerebellum, and brain to internalize their intentions and interaction concepts of objects, allowing for the pre-formulation of interactions and making behaviors even when interaction regions are out of sight. In light of this, we propose harmonizing the visual appearance, head motion, and 3D object to excavate the object interaction concept and subject intention, jointly inferring 3D human contact and object affordance from egocentric videos. To achieve this, we present EgoChoir, which links object structures with interaction contexts inherent in appearance and head motion to reveal object affordance, further utilizing it to model human contact.

| **[Scaling Instructable Agents Across Many Simulated Worlds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10179v3)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building embodied AI systems that can follow arbitrary language instructions in any 3D environment is a key challenge for creating general AI. Accomplishing this goal requires learning to ground language in perception and embodied actions, in order to accomplish complex tasks. The Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project tackles this by training agents to follow free-form instructions across a diverse range of virtual 3D environments, including curated research environments as well as open-ended, commercial video games. Our goal is to develop an instructable agent that can accomplish anything a human can do in any simulated 3D environment. Our approach focuses on language-driven generality while imposing minimal assumptions. Our agents interact with environments in real-time using a generic, human-like interface: the inputs are image observations and language instructions and the outputs are keyboard-and-mouse actions. This general approach is challenging, but it allows agents to ground language across many visually complex and semantically rich environments while also allowing us to readily run agents in new environments. In this paper we describe our motivation and goal, the initial progress we have made, and promising preliminary results on several diverse research environments and a variety of commercial video games.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Robotics and Embodied AI make public urban spaces no longer exclusive to humans. Food delivery bots and electric wheelchairs have started sharing sidewalks with pedestrians, while robot dogs and humanoids have recently emerged in the street. Micromobility enabled by AI for short-distance travel in public urban spaces plays a crucial component in the future transportation system. Ensuring the generalizability and safety of AI models maneuvering mobile machines is essential. In this work, we present MetaUrban, a compositional simulation platform for the AI-driven urban micromobility research. MetaUrban can construct an infinite number of interactive urban scenes from compositional elements, covering a vast array of ground plans, object placements, pedestrians, vulnerable road users, and other mobile agents' appearances and dynamics. We design point navigation and social navigation tasks as the pilot study using MetaUrban for urban micromobility research and establish various baselines of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. We conduct extensive evaluation across mobile machines, demonstrating that heterogeneous mechanical structures significantly influence the learning and execution of AI policies. We perform a thorough ablation study, showing that the compositional nature of the simulated environments can substantially improve the generalizability and safety of the trained mobile agents. MetaUrban will be made publicly available to provide research opportunities and foster safe and trustworthy embodied AI and micromobility in cities. The code and dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report. Project page: https://metadriverse.github.io/metaurban/</p></details> |

Hand motion models with the sophistication to accurately recreate piano playing have a wide range of applications in character animation, embodied AI, biomechanics, and VR/AR. In this paper, we construct a first-of-its-kind large-scale dataset that contains approximately 10 hours of 3D hand motion and audio from 15 elite-level pianists playing 153 pieces of classical music. To capture natural performances, we designed a markerless setup in which motions are reconstructed from multi-view videos using state-of-the-art pose estimation models. The motion data is further refined via inverse kinematics using the high-resolution MIDI key-pressing data obtained from sensors in a specialized Yamaha Disklavier piano. Leveraging the collected dataset, we developed a pipeline that can synthesize physically-plausible hand motions for musical scores outside of the dataset. Our approach employs a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning to obtain policies for physics-based bimanual control involving the interaction between hands and piano keys. To solve the sampling efficiency problem with the large motion dataset, we use a diffusion model to generate natural reference motions, which provide high-level trajectory and fingering (finger order and placement) information. However, the generated reference motion alone does not provide sufficient accuracy for piano performance modeling. We then further augmented the data by using musical similarity to retrieve similar motions from the captured dataset to boost the precision of the RL policy. With the proposed method, our model generates natural, dexterous motions that generalize to music from outside the training dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2024.

| **[Learning the Generalizable Manipulation Skills on Soft-body Tasks via Guided Self-attention Behavior Cloning Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05756v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI represents a paradigm in AI research where artificial agents are situated within and interact with physical or virtual environments. Despite the recent progress in Embodied AI, it is still very challenging to learn the generalizable manipulation skills that can handle large deformation and topological changes on soft-body objects, such as clay, water, and soil. In this work, we proposed an effective policy, namely GP2E behavior cloning policy, which can guide the agent to learn the generalizable manipulation skills from soft-body tasks, including pouring, filling, hanging, excavating, pinching, and writing. Concretely, we build our policy from three insights:(1) Extracting intricate semantic features from point cloud data and seamlessly integrating them into the robot's end-effector frame; (2) Capturing long-distance interactions in long-horizon tasks through the incorporation of our guided self-attention module; (3) Mitigating overfitting concerns and facilitating model convergence to higher accuracy levels via the introduction of our two-stage fine-tuning strategy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving the 1st prize in the soft-body track of the ManiSkill2 Challenge at the CVPR 2023 4th Embodied AI workshop. Our findings highlight the potential of our method to improve the generalization abilities of Embodied AI models and pave the way for their practical applications in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-Aware Transformer Networks for Robotic Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02669v2)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research in Visual Navigation reveals opportunities for improvement. First, the direct adoption of RNNs and Transformers often overlooks the specific differences between Embodied AI and traditional sequential data modelling, potentially limiting its performance in Embodied AI tasks. Second, the reliance on task-specific configurations, such as pre-trained modules and dataset-specific logic, compromises the generalizability of these methods. We address these constraints by initially exploring the unique differences between Navigation tasks and other sequential data tasks through the lens of Causality, presenting a causal framework to elucidate the inadequacies of conventional sequential methods for Navigation. By leveraging this causal perspective, we propose Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) Networks for Navigation, featuring a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the models's Environmental Understanding capability. Meanwhile, our method is devoid of task-specific inductive biases and can be trained in an End-to-End manner, which enhances the method's generalizability across various contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology consistently surpasses benchmark performances across a spectrum of settings, tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablation studies reveal that the performance gains can be attributed to the Causal Understanding Module, which demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in both Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning settings.</p></details> |  |

Exploring Backdoor Attacks against Embodied LLM-based Decision-Making Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20774v2)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in real-world decision-making tasks for embodied artificial intelligence, especially when fine-tuned to leverage their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities while being tailored to specific applications. However, this fine-tuning process introduces considerable safety and security vulnerabilities, especially in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-based Decision-making systems (BALD) in embodied AI, systematically exploring the attack surfaces and trigger mechanisms. Specifically, we propose three distinct attack mechanisms: word injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection, targeting various components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline. We perform extensive experiments on representative LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2) in autonomous driving and home robot tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and stealthiness of our backdoor triggers across various attack channels, with cases like vehicles accelerating toward obstacles and robots placing knives on beds. Our word and knowledge injection attacks achieve nearly 100% success rate across multiple models and datasets while requiring only limited access to the system. Our scenario manipulation attack yields success rates exceeding 65%, reaching up to 90%, and does not require any runtime system intrusion. We also assess the robustness of these attacks against defenses, revealing their resilience. Our findings highlight critical security vulnerabilities in embodied LLM systems and emphasize the urgent need for safeguarding these systems to mitigate potential risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, including main paper, references, and appendix</p></details> |

However, there is still lack of study on how vision language models~(VLMs) behave when multi-modal task inputs are considered. Counterfactual planning that evaluates the model's reasoning ability over alternative task situations are also under exploited. In order to evaluate the planning ability of both multi-modal and counterfactual aspects, we propose ActPlan-1K. ActPlan-1K is a multi-modal planning benchmark constructed based on ChatGPT and household activity simulator iGibson2. The benchmark consists of 153 activities and 1,187 instances. Each instance describing one activity has a natural language task description and multiple environment images from the simulator. The gold plan of each instance is action sequences over the objects in provided scenes. Both the correctness and commonsense satisfaction are evaluated on typical VLMs. It turns out that current VLMs are still struggling at generating human-level procedural plans for both normal activities and counterfactual activities. We further provide automatic evaluation metrics by finetuning over BLEURT model to facilitate future research on our benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables, accepted to EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

With the advancement of embodied AI, robots are increasingly capable of satisfying human demands. Demand-driven navigation (DDN) is a task in which an agent must locate an object to satisfy a specified demand instruction, such as ``I am thirsty.'' The previous study typically assumes that each demand instruction requires only one object to be fulfilled and does not consider individual preferences. However, the realistic human demand may involve multiple objects. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-object Demand-driven Navigation (MO-DDN) benchmark, which addresses these nuanced aspects, including multi-object search and personal preferences, thus making the MO-DDN task more reflective of real-life scenarios compared to DDN. Building upon previous work, we employ the concept of ``attribute'' to tackle this new task. However, instead of solely relying on attribute features in an end-to-end manner like DDN, we propose a modular method that involves constructing a coarse-to-fine attribute-based exploration agent (C2FAgent). Our experimental results illustrate that this coarse-to-fine exploration strategy capitalizes on the advantages of attributes at various decision-making levels, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods.

However, relying on hand-crafted prior knowledge about the geometric structure of the object fails when generalising to unseen objects, and depth sensors fail to detect transparent objects such as drinking glasses. In this work, we propose a stereo-based method for hand-object reconstruction that combines single-view reconstructions probabilistically to form a coherent stereo reconstruction. We learn 3D shape priors from a large synthetic hand-object dataset to ensure that our method is generalisable, and use RGB inputs to better capture transparent objects. We show that our method reduces the object Chamfer distance compared to existing RGB based hand-object reconstruction methods on single view and stereo settings. We process the reconstructed hand-object shape with a projection-based outlier removal step and use the output to guide a human-to-robot handover pipeline with wide-baseline stereo RGB cameras. Our hand-object reconstruction enables a robot to successfully receive a diverse range of household objects from the human.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

A good replacement for human intervention can be offered by climbing robots. The different solutions existing in the literature are not up to the task for the difficulty of the requirements (navigation, heavy payloads, flexibility in the execution of the tasks). In this paper, we propose a robotic platform that can fill this gap. Our solution is based on a robot that hangs on ropes, and uses a retractable leg to jump away from the mountain walls. Our package of mechanical solutions, along with the algorithms developed for motion planning and control, delivers swift navigation on irregular and steep slopes, the possibility to overcome or travel around significant natural barriers, and the ability to carry heavy payloads and execute complex tasks. In the paper, we give a full account of our main design and algorithmic choices and show the feasibility of the solution through a large number of physically simulated scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address the problem of inserting a hanger into various unseen garments that are initially laid flat on a table. This task is challenging due to its long-horizon nature, the high degrees of freedom of the garments and the lack of data. To simplify the learning process, we first propose breaking the task into several subtasks. Then, we formulate each subtask as a policy learning problem and propose a low-dimensional action parameterization. To overcome the challenge of limited data, we build our own simulator and create 144 synthetic clothing assets to effectively collect high-quality training data. Our approach uses single-view depth images and object masks as input, which mitigates the Sim2Real appearance gap and achieves high generalization capabilities for new garments. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world validate our proposed method. By training on various garments in the simulator, our method achieves a 75\% success rate with 8 different unseen garments in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://chen01yx.github.io/Robohanger_Index/</p></details> |

This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms to enable zero-shot task-conditioned grasp synthesis. The framework segments objects into meaningful subparts and labels each subpart semantically, creating structured representations that can be used to prompt an LLM. By coupling semantic and geometric representations of an object's structure, the LLM's knowledge about tasks and which parts to grasp can be applied in the physical world. The QD-generated grasp archive provides a diverse set of grasps, allowing us to select the most suitable grasp based on the task. We evaluated the proposed method on a subset of the YCB dataset with a Franka Emika robot. A consolidated ground truth for task-specific grasp regions is established through a survey. Our work achieves a weighted intersection over union (IoU) of 73.6% in predicting task-conditioned grasp regions in 65 task-object combinations. An end-to-end validation study on a smaller subset further confirms the effectiveness of our approach, with 88% of responses favoring the task-aware grasp over the control group. A binomial test shows that participants significantly prefer the task-aware grasp.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025, Video: https://youtu.be/TCLXm8kPWz4</p></details> |

Advances in artificial intelligence have introduced promising learning-based methods to address this challenge, with imitation learning emerging as particularly effective. However, efficiently acquiring high-quality demonstrations remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce an immersive VR-based teleoperation setup designed to collect demonstrations from a remote human user. We also propose an imitation learning framework called Haptic Action Chunking with Transformers (Haptic-ACT). To evaluate the platform, we conducted a pick-and-place task and collected 50 demonstration episodes. Results indicate that the immersive VR platform significantly reduces demonstrator fingertip forces compared to systems without haptic feedback, enabling more delicate manipulation. Additionally, evaluations of the Haptic-ACT framework in both the MuJoCo simulator and on a real robot demonstrate its effectiveness in teaching robots more compliant manipulation compared to the original ACT.

In this paper, we address this gap by introducing GemBench, a novel benchmark to assess generalization capabilities of vision-language robotic manipulation policies. GemBench incorporates seven general action primitives and four levels of generalization, spanning novel placements, rigid and articulated objects, and complex long-horizon tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art approaches on GemBench and also introduce a new method. Our approach 3D-LOTUS leverages rich 3D information for action prediction conditioned on language.

Additionally, robotic systems are typically assumed to follow basic rigid-body dynamics. However, several examples in nature illustrate how changes in physical material properties yield functional advantages. In this paper, we explore how physical materials (non-rigid bodies) affect the functional performance of a hopping robot. In doing so, we address the practical question of how to model and simulate material properties. Through these simulations we demonstrate that material gradients in the leg of a single-limb hopper provide functional advantages compared to homogeneous designs. For example, when considering incline ramp hopping, a material gradient with increasing density provides a 35% reduction in tracking error and a 23% reduction in power consumption compared to homogeneous stainless steel. By providing bio-inspiration to the rigid limbs in a robotic system, we seek to show that future fabrication of robots should look to leverage the material anisotropies of moduli and density found in nature. This would allow for reduced vibrations in the system and would provide offsets of joint torques and vibrations while protecting their structural integrity against reduced fatigue and wear. This simulation system could inspire future intelligent material gradients of custom-fabricated robotic locomotive devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at ICRA 2025</p></details> |

If the system is not trained enough, the task will likely not be completed and could pose a risk to the surrounding environment. We introduce Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning guided by Language-based Inter-Robot Negotiation (MARLIN), in which the training process requires fewer training episodes to reach peak performance. Robots are equipped with large language models that negotiate and debate a task, producing plans used to guide the policy during training. The approach dynamically switches between using reinforcement learning and large language model-based action negotiation throughout training. This reduces the number of training episodes required, compared to standard multi-agent reinforcement learning, and hence allows the system to be deployed to physical hardware earlier. The performance of this approach is evaluated against multi-agent reinforcement learning, showing that our hybrid method achieves comparable results with significantly reduced training time.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, their application in robotic scenarios, particularly for long-horizon manipulation tasks, reveals significant limitations. These limitations arise from the current MLLMs lacking three essential robotic brain capabilities: Planning Capability, which involves decomposing complex manipulation instructions into manageable sub-tasks; Affordance Perception, the ability to recognize and interpret the affordances of interactive objects; and Trajectory Prediction, the foresight to anticipate the complete manipulation trajectory necessary for successful execution. To enhance the robotic brain's core capabilities from abstract to concrete, we introduce ShareRobot, a high-quality heterogeneous dataset that labels multi-dimensional information such as task planning, object affordance, and end-effector trajectory. ShareRobot's diversity and accuracy have been meticulously refined by three human annotators. Building on this dataset, we developed RoboBrain, an MLLM-based model that combines robotic and general multi-modal data, utilizes a multi-stage training strategy, and incorporates long videos and high-resolution images to improve its robotic manipulation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance across various robotic tasks, highlighting its potential to advance robotic brain capabilities.</p></details> |  |

In this variant, we are given an undirected graph $G$, $k$ robots $R_1,\dots,R_k$ positioned on distinct vertices of $G$, $p\leq k$ distinct destination vertices for robots $R_1,\dots,R_p$, and $\ell \in \mathbb{N}$. The problem is to decide if there is a serial schedule of at most $\ell$ moves (i.e., of makespan $\ell$) such that at the end of the schedule each robot with a destination reaches it, where a robot's move is a free path (unoccupied by any robots) from its current position to an unoccupied vertex. The problem is known to be NP-hard even on full grids. It has been studied in several contexts, including coin movement and reconfiguration problems, with respect to feasibility, complexity, and approximation. Geometric variants of the problem, in which congruent geometric-shape robots (e.g., unit disk/squares) slide or translate in the Euclidean plane, have also been studied extensively. We investigate the parameterized complexity of CSMP with respect to two parameters: the number $k$ of robots and the makespan $\ell$. As our first result, we present a fixed-parameter algorithm for CSMP parameterized by $k$. For our second result, we present a fixed-parameter algorithm parameterized by $\ell$ for the special case of CSMP in which only a single robot has a destination and the graph is planar, which we prove to be NP-complete. A crucial new ingredient for both of our results is that the solution admits a succinct representation as a small labeled topological minor of the input graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arc-Length-Based Warping for Robot Skill Synthesis from Multiple Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13322v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robotics, Learning from Demonstration (LfD) aims to transfer skills to robots by using multiple demonstrations of the same task. These demonstrations are recorded and processed to extract a consistent skill representation. This process typically requires temporal alignment through techniques such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). In this paper, we consider a novel algorithm, named Spatial Sampling (SS), specifically designed for robot trajectories, that enables time-independent alignment of the trajectories by providing an arc-length parametrization of the signals. This approach eliminates the need for temporal alignment, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of skill representation, especially when recorded movements are subject to intermittent motions or extremely variable speeds, a common characteristic of operations based on kinesthetic teaching, where the operator may encounter difficulties in guiding the end-effector smoothly. To prove this, we built a custom publicly available dataset of robot recordings to test real-world movements, where the user tracks the same geometric path multiple times, with motion laws that vary greatly and are subject to starting and stopping. The SS demonstrates better performances against state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of (i) trajectory synchronization and (ii) quality of the extracted skill.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Typically, materials are ferried between these machines using a team of mobile robots. To embed a manufacturing procedure in a smart factory, a factory operator must a) assign its processes to the smart factory's machines and b) determine how agents should carry materials between machines. A good embedding maximizes the smart factory's throughput; the rate at which it outputs products. Existing smart factory management systems solve the aforementioned problems sequentially, limiting the throughput that they can achieve. In this paper we introduce ACES, the Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver, the first solver which jointly optimizes the assignment of processes to machines and the assignment of paths to agents. We evaluate ACES and show that it can scale to real industrial scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, the relationship between these two paradigms is not well-studied. This work aims to systematically investigate the robustness and performance of SARL and MARL in the same task. We first analytically show that independent Gaussian policies optimized by policy-gradient based SARL and MARL are equivalent under full-state observations. Following, we empirically show that in certain inherently single-agent tasks, perhaps surprisingly, we can use multiple agents to control a robot such that each agent only has access to partial observations. Since in these cases an agent does not depend on full state information multi-agent policies can provide additional robustness to perturbations and failures. Experiments on an illustrative decentralized control task and a mobile manipulation task with a real robot show that multiple agents with access to partial observations outperform a single agent when parts of the system fail.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures |

Vibrotactile communication could be useful in providing information without compropmising or loading a person's visual or auditory perception. This paper considers applications in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) scenarios where a human working alongside a robot is likely to be operating in high cognitive load conditions. The focus is on understanding how best to convey information considering different vibrotactile information coding strategies to enhance scene understanding in scenarios where a robot might be operating remotely as a scout. In exploring information representation, this paper introduces Semantic Haptics, using shapes and patterns to represent certain events as if the skin was a screen, and shows how these lead to bettter learnability and interpreation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Quiet Walking for a Small Home Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10983v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As home robotics gains traction, robots are increasingly integrated into households, offering companionship and assistance. Quadruped robots, particularly those resembling dogs, have emerged as popular alternatives for traditional pets. However, user feedback highlights concerns about the noise these robots generate during walking at home, particularly the loud footstep sound. To address this issue, we propose a sim-to-real based reinforcement learning (RL) approach to minimize the foot contact velocity highly related to the footstep sound. Our framework incorporates three key elements: learning varying PD gains to actively dampen and stiffen each joint, utilizing foot contact sensors, and employing curriculum learning to gradually enforce penalties on foot contact velocity. Experiments demonstrate that our learned policy achieves superior quietness compared to a RL baseline and the carefully handcrafted Sony commercial controllers. Furthermore, the trade-off between robustness and quietness is shown. This research contributes to developing quieter and more user-friendly robotic companions in home environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ICRA 2025</p></details> |

While VLMs offer rich multimodal reasoning, existing approaches lack user-specific adaptability, often relying on generic interaction paradigms that fail to account for individual behavioral, contextual, or socio-emotional nuances. When customization is attempted, ethical concerns arise from unmitigated biases in user data, risking exclusion or unfair treatment. To address these dual challenges, we propose User-VLM 360{\deg}, a holistic framework integrating multimodal user modeling with bias-aware optimization. Our approach features: (1) user-aware tuning that adapts interactions in real time using visual-linguistic signals; (2) bias mitigation via preference optimization; and (3) curated 360{\deg} socio-emotive interaction datasets annotated with demographic, emotion, and relational metadata. Evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art results: +35.3% F1 in personalized VQA, +47.5% F1 in facial features understanding, 15% bias reduction, and 30X speedup over baselines. Ablation studies confirm component efficacy, and deployment on the Pepper robot validates real-time adaptability across diverse users. We open-source parameter-efficient 3B/10B models and an ethical verification framework for responsible adaptation.</p></details> |  |

The utility of the proposed approach is particularly evident in mobile robotics, where agents benefit from being organized and navigated in formation for a variety of real-world applications requiring frequent alterations in formation shape for efficient navigation or task completion. Given the constrained operational time inherent to battery-powered mobile robots, the time needed to complete the formation reshaping process is crucial for their efficient operation, especially in case of multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed Collision-Aware Time-Optimal formation Reshaping Algorithm (CAT-ORA) builds upon the Hungarian algorithm for the solution of the robot-to-goal assignment implementing the inter-agent collision avoidance through direct constraints on mutually exclusive robot-goal pairs combined with a trajectory generation approach minimizing the duration of the reshaping process. Theoretical validations confirm the optimality of CAT-ORA, with its efficacy further showcased through simulations, and a real-world outdoor experiment involving 19 UAVs. Thorough numerical analysis shows the potential of CAT-ORA to decrease the time required to perform complex formation reshaping tasks by up to 49%, and 12% on average compared to commonly used methods in randomly generated scenarios.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |
| **[FuseGrasp: Radar-Camera Fusion for Robotic Grasping of Transparent Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20037v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transparent objects are prevalent in everyday environments, but their distinct physical properties pose significant challenges for camera-guided robotic arms. Current research is mainly dependent on camera-only approaches, which often falter in suboptimal conditions, such as low-light environments. In response to this challenge, we present FuseGrasp, the first radar-camera fusion system tailored to enhance the transparent objects manipulation. FuseGrasp exploits the weak penetrating property of millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals, which causes transparent materials to appear opaque, and combines it with the precise motion control of a robotic arm to acquire high-quality mmWave radar images of transparent objects. The system employs a carefully designed deep neural network to fuse radar and camera imagery, thereby improving depth completion and elevating the success rate of object grasping. Nevertheless, training FuseGrasp effectively is non-trivial, due to limited radar image datasets for transparent objects. We address this issue utilizing large RGB-D dataset, and propose an effective two-stage training approach: we first pre-train FuseGrasp on a large public RGB-D dataset of transparent objects, then fine-tune it on a self-built small RGB-D-Radar dataset. Furthermore, as a byproduct, FuseGrasp can determine the composition of transparent objects, such as glass or plastic, leveraging the material identification capability of mmWave radar. This identification result facilitates the robotic arm in modulating its grip force appropriately. Extensive testing reveals that FuseGrasp significantly improves the accuracy of depth reconstruction and material identification for transparent objects. Moreover, real-world robotic trials have confirmed that FuseGrasp markedly enhances the handling of transparent items. A video demonstration of FuseGrasp is available at https://youtu.be/MWDqv0sRSok.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 20 figures, accepted by IEEE TMC</p></details> |

| **[LV-DOT: LiDAR-visual dynamic obstacle detection and tracking for autonomous robot navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20607v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate perception of dynamic obstacles is essential for autonomous robot navigation in indoor environments. Although sophisticated 3D object detection and tracking methods have been investigated and developed thoroughly in the fields of computer vision and autonomous driving, their demands on expensive and high-accuracy sensor setups and substantial computational resources from large neural networks make them unsuitable for indoor robotics. Recently, more lightweight perception algorithms leveraging onboard cameras or LiDAR sensors have emerged as promising alternatives. However, relying on a single sensor poses significant limitations: cameras have limited fields of view and can suffer from high noise, whereas LiDAR sensors operate at lower frequencies and lack the richness of visual features. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic obstacle detection and tracking framework that uses both onboard camera and LiDAR data to enable lightweight and accurate perception. Our proposed method expands on our previous ensemble detection approach, which integrates outputs from multiple low-accuracy but computationally efficient detectors to ensure real-time performance on the onboard computer. In this work, we propose a more robust fusion strategy that integrates both LiDAR and visual data to enhance detection accuracy further. We then utilize a tracking module that adopts feature-based object association and the Kalman filter to track and estimate detected obstacles' states. Besides, a dynamic obstacle classification algorithm is designed to robustly identify moving objects. The dataset evaluation demonstrates a better perception performance compared to benchmark methods. The physical experiments on a quadcopter robot confirms the feasibility for real-world navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This is particularly restrictive in robotics, where each data point must be physically executed in the real world. Consequently, there is a critical need for alternative data sources for robotics and frameworks that enable learning from such data. In this work, we present Point Policy, a new method for learning robot policies exclusively from offline human demonstration videos and without any teleoperation data. Point Policy leverages state-of-the-art vision models and policy architectures to translate human hand poses into robot poses while capturing object states through semantically meaningful key points. This approach yields a morphology-agnostic representation that facilitates effective policy learning. Our experiments on 8 real-world tasks demonstrate an overall 75% absolute improvement over prior works when evaluated in identical settings as training. Further, Point Policy exhibits a 74% gain across tasks for novel object instances and is robust to significant background clutter.

While most exploration planners assume omnidirectional sensors like LiDAR, this is impractical for small robots such as drones, where lightweight, directional sensors like cameras may be the only option due to payload constraints. These sensors have a constrained field-of-view (FoV), which adds complexity to the exploration problem, requiring not only optimal robot positioning but also sensor orientation during movement. In this work, we propose MARVEL, a neural framework that leverages graph attention networks, together with novel frontiers and orientation features fusion technique, to develop a collaborative, decentralized policy using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for robots with constrained FoV. To handle the large action space of viewpoints planning, we further introduce a novel information-driven action pruning strategy. MARVEL improves multi-robot coordination and decision-making in challenging large-scale indoor environments, while adapting to various team sizes and sensor configurations (i.e., FoV and sensor range) without additional training. Our extensive evaluation shows that MARVEL's learned policies exhibit effective coordinated behaviors, outperforming state-of-the-art exploration planners across multiple metrics. We experimentally demonstrate MARVEL's generalizability in large-scale environments, of up to 90m by 90m, and validate its practical applicability through successful deployment on a team of real drone hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 20XX IEEE.

| **[Discovering Antagonists in Networks of Systems: Robot Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20125v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A contextual anomaly detection method is proposed and applied to the physical motions of a robot swarm executing a coverage task. Using simulations of a swarm's normal behavior, a normalizing flow is trained to predict the likelihood of a robot motion within the current context of its environment. During application, the predicted likelihood of the observed motions is used by a detection criterion that categorizes a robot agent as normal or antagonistic. The proposed method is evaluated on five different strategies of antagonistic behavior. Importantly, only readily available simulated data of normal robot behavior is used for training such that the nature of the anomalies need not be known beforehand. The best detection criterion correctly categorizes at least 80% of each antagonistic type while maintaining a false positive rate of less than 5% for normal robot agents. Additionally, the method is validated in hardware experiments, yielding results similar to the simulated scenarios. Compared to the state-of-the-art approach, both the predictive performance of the normalizing flow and the robustness of the detection criterion are increased.</p></details> | reduced file size |

These scenarios often involve object handovers between the person and the robot. To achieve safe and efficient human-robot collaboration (HRC), it is important to incorporate human context in a robot's handover strategies. Therefore, in this work, we develop a collaborative handover model trained on human teleoperation data collected in a naturalistic crafting task. To evaluate the performance of this model, we conduct cross-validation experiments on the training dataset as well as a user study in the same HRC crafting task. The handover episodes and user perceptions of the autonomous handover policy were compared with those of the human teleoperated handovers. While the cross-validation experiment and user study indicate that the autonomous policy successfully achieved collaborative handovers, the comparison with human teleoperation revealed avenues for further improvements.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes a one-step lookback approach that jointly learns the deep incremental model and the policy to realize the sample-efficient continuous robotic control, wherein the control-theoretical knowledge is utilized to decrease the model learning difficulty and facilitate efficient training. Specifically, we use one-step backward data to facilitate the deep incremental model, an alternative structured representation of the robotic evolution model, that accurately predicts the robotic movement but with low sample complexity. This is because the formulated deep incremental model degrades the model learning difficulty into a parametric matrix learning problem, which is especially favourable to high-dimensional robotic applications. The imagined data from the learned deep incremental model is used to supplement training data to enhance the sample efficiency. Comparative numerical simulations on benchmark continuous robotics control problems are conducted to validate the efficiency of our proposed one-step lookback approach.</p></details> |  |

By learning separate distance fields for each link and combining them through the kinematics chain, the learned N-CEDF provides an accurate and computationally efficient representation of the robot's shape. The key advantage of a distance function representation of a continuum robot is that it enables efficient collision checking for motion planning in dynamic and cluttered environments, even with point-cloud observations. We integrate the N-CEDF into a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller to generate safe trajectories for multi-segment continuum robots. The proposed approach is validated for continuum robots with various links in several simulated environments with static and dynamic obstacles.</p></details> |  |

Human gaze is closely linked to hand movements during object manipulation. We hypothesize that an imitating agent's gaze control, fixating on specific landmarks and transitioning between them, simultaneously segments demonstrated manipulations into sub-tasks. This study proposes a simple yet robust task decomposition method based on gaze transitions. Using teleoperation, a common modality in robotic manipulation for collecting demonstrations, in which a human operator's gaze is measured and used for task decomposition as a substitute for an imitating agent's gaze. Our approach ensures consistent task decomposition across all demonstrations for each task, which is desirable in contexts such as machine learning. We evaluated the method across demonstrations of various tasks, assessing the characteristics and consistency of the resulting sub-tasks. Furthermore, extensive testing across different hyperparameter settings confirmed its robustness, making it adaptable to diverse robotic systems.

However, robust perception and localization for snake robots remain an open challenge due to the proximity of the sensor payload to the ground coupled with a limited field of view. To address this issue, we propose Blind-motion with Intermittently Scheduled Scans (BLISS) which combines proprioception-only mobility with intermittent scans to be resilient against both localization failures and collision risks. BLISS is formulated as an integrated Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) problem that leads to a Chance-Constrained Hybrid Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (CC-HPOMDP), known to be computationally intractable due to the curse of history. Our novelty lies in reformulating CC-HPOMDP as a tractable, convex Mixed Integer Linear Program. This allows us to solve BLISS-TAMP significantly faster and jointly derive optimal task-motion plans. Simulations and hardware experiments on the EELS snake robot show our method achieves over an order of magnitude computational improvement compared to state-of-the-art POMDP planners and $>$ 50\% better navigation time optimality versus classical two-stage planners.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures.

However, existing methods of guidewire navigation rely on manual demonstration data and have a suboptimal success rate. In this work, we propose a knowledge-driven visual guidance (KVG) method that leverages available visual information from interventional imaging to facilitate guidewire navigation. Our approach integrates image segmentation and detection techniques to extract surgical knowledge, including vascular maps and guidewire positions. We introduce BDA-star, a novel path planning algorithm with boundary distance constraints, to optimize trajectory planning for guidewire navigation. To validate the method, we developed the KVD-Reinforcement Learning environment, where observations consist of real-time guidewire feeding images highlighting the guidewire tip position and the planned path. We proposed a reward function based on the distances from both the guidewire tip to the planned path and the target to evaluate the agent's actions.Additionally, to address stability issues and slow convergence rates associated with direct learning from raw pixels, we incorporated a pre-trained convolutional neural network into the policy network for feature extraction. Experiments conducted on the aortic simulation autonomous guidewire navigation platform demonstrated that the proposed method, targeting the left subclavian artery, left carotid artery and the brachiocephalic artery, achieved a 100\% guidewire navigation success rate, along with reduced movement and retraction distances and trajectories tend to the center of the vessels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image-Based Roadmaps for Vision-Only Planning and Control of Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19617v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a motion planning framework for robotic manipulators that computes collision-free paths directly in image space. The generated paths can then be tracked using vision-based control, eliminating the need for an explicit robot model or proprioceptive sensing. At the core of our approach is the construction of a roadmap entirely in image space. To achieve this, we explicitly define sampling, nearest-neighbor selection, and collision checking based on visual features rather than geometric models. We first collect a set of image-space samples by moving the robot within its workspace, capturing keypoints along its body at different configurations. These samples serve as nodes in the roadmap, which we construct using either learned or predefined distance metrics. At runtime, the roadmap generates collision-free paths directly in image space, removing the need for a robot model or joint encoders. We validate our approach through an experimental study in which a robotic arm follows planned paths using an adaptive vision-based control scheme to avoid obstacles. The results show that paths generated with the learned-distance roadmap achieved 100% success in control convergence, whereas the predefined image-space distance roadmap enabled faster transient responses but had a lower success rate in convergence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hi Robot: Open-Ended Instruction Following with Hierarchical Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19417v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robots that can perform a range of different tasks in open-world settings must be able to not only reason about the steps needed to accomplish their goals, but also process complex instructions, prompts, and even feedback during task execution. Intricate instructions (e.g., "Could you make me a vegetarian sandwich?" or "I don't like that one") require not just the ability to physically perform the individual steps, but the ability to situate complex commands and feedback in the physical world. In this work, we describe a system that uses vision-language models in a hierarchical structure, first reasoning over complex prompts and user feedback to deduce the most appropriate next step to fulfill the task, and then performing that step with low-level actions. In contrast to direct instruction following methods that can fulfill simple commands ("pick up the cup"), our system can reason through complex prompts and incorporate situated feedback during task execution ("that's not trash"). We evaluate our system across three robotic platforms, including single-arm, dual-arm, and dual-arm mobile robots, demonstrating its ability to handle tasks such as cleaning messy tables, making sandwiches, and grocery shopping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Robot Learning for Automatic Robot Motion Planning in Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19340v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial robots are widely used in diverse manufacturing environments. Nonetheless, how to enable robots to automatically plan trajectories for changing tasks presents a considerable challenge. Further complexities arise when robots operate within work cells alongside machines, humans, or other robots. This paper introduces a multi-level hybrid robot motion planning method combining a task space Reinforcement Learning-based Learning from Demonstration (RL-LfD) agent and a joint-space based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based agent. A higher level agent learns to switch between the two agents to enable feasible and smooth motion. The feasibility is computed by incorporating reachability, joint limits, manipulability, and collision risks of the robot in the given environment. Therefore, the derived hybrid motion planning policy generates a feasible trajectory that adheres to task constraints. The effectiveness of the method is validated through sim ulated robotic scenarios and in a real-world setup.</p></details> | 35 Pages, 11 Figures |

This issue is particularly pronounced when manipulating meter-scale objects or those with varying stiffness, as traditional gripping techniques and strategies frequently prove inadequate. In this letter, we introduce a novel surface-based multi-module robotic manipulation framework that utilizes a Central Pattern Generator (CPG)-based motion generator, combined with a simulation-based optimization method to determine the optimal manipulation parameters for a multi-module origami robotic surface (Ori-Pixel). This approach allows for the manipulation of objects ranging from centimeters to meters in size, with varying stiffness and shape. The optimized CPG parameters are tested through both dynamic simulations and a series of prototype experiments involving a wide range of objects differing in size, weight, shape, and material, demonstrating robust manipulation capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under revision for possible publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L).

However, the lack of suitable garden spaces, demanding daily schedules and limited gardening expertise present major roadblocks for citizens looking to engage in urban gardening. While prior research has explored smart home solutions to support urban gardeners, these approaches currently do not fully address these practical barriers. In this paper, we present PlantPal, a system that enables the cultivation of garden spaces irrespective of one's location, expertise level, or time constraints. PlantPal enables the shared operation of a precision agriculture robot (PAR) that is equipped with garden tools and a multi-camera system. Insights from a 3-week deployment (N=18) indicate that PlantPal facilitated the integration of gardening tasks into daily routines, fostered a sense of connection with one's field, and provided an engaging experience despite the remote setting. We contribute design considerations for future robot-assisted urban gardening concepts.</p></details> |  |

Although advances in deep learning have made it increasingly feasible to replicate the dexterity of human teleoperation in robots, generalizing these acquired skills to previously unseen scenarios remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm, Gaze-based Bottleneck-aware Robot Manipulation (GazeBot), which enables high reusability of the learned motions even when the object positions and end-effector poses differ from those in the provided demonstrations. By leveraging gaze information and motion bottlenecks, both crucial features for object manipulation, GazeBot achieves high generalization performance compared with state-of-the-art imitation learning methods, without sacrificing its dexterity and reactivity. Furthermore, the training process of GazeBot is entirely data-driven once a demonstration dataset with gaze data is provided.

As robots become more prevalent in workplaces, homes and public spaces, understanding how sounds produced by robots affect human-perceptions of these robots is becoming increasingly important to creating positive human robot interactions (HRI). This paper presents the results from 182 participants (858 trials) investigating how human-perception of robots is changed by consequential sounds. In a between-participants study, participants in the sound condition were shown 5 videos of different robots and asked their opinions on the robots and the sounds they made. This was compared to participants in the control condition who viewed silent videos. Consequential sounds correlated with significantly more negative perceptions of robots, including increased negative `associated affects', feeling more distracted, and being less willing to colocate in a shared environment with robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures - Accepted to be published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL).

Traditionally, multi-agent reinforcement learning solves this implicitly through a joint reward and centralized observations, assuming collaborative behavior will emerge. Other studies propose to learn from demonstrations of a group of collaborative experts. Instead, we propose an efficient and explicit way of learning collaborative behaviors in multi-agent systems by leveraging expertise from only a single human. Our insight is that humans can naturally take on various roles in a team. We show that agents can effectively learn to collaborate by allowing a human operator to dynamically switch between controlling agents for a short period and incorporating a human-like theory-of-mind model of teammates. Our experiments showed that our method improves the success rate of a challenging collaborative hide-and-seek task by up to 58% with only 40 minutes of human guidance. We further demonstrate our findings transfer to the real world by conducting multi-robot experiments.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel approach to modeling physical human-robot interaction in a physics-based simulator (MuJoCo) using soft-body dynamics. We integrate a flexible head model with a rigid skeleton while accounting for internal dynamics, enabling the flexible model to be actuated by the skeleton. Incorporating realistic soft-skin contact dynamics in simulation allows for systematically evaluating bite transfer parameters, such as insertion depth and entry angle, and their impact on user safety and comfort. Our findings suggest that a straight-in-straight-out strategy minimizes forces and enhances user comfort in robot-assisted feeding, assuming a static head. This simulation-based approach offers a safer and more controlled alternative to real-world experimentation.

| **[CURE: Simulation-Augmented Auto-Tuning in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05399v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic systems are typically composed of various subsystems, such as localization and navigation, each encompassing numerous configurable components (e.g., selecting different planning algorithms). Once an algorithm has been selected for a component, its associated configuration options must be set to the appropriate values. Configuration options across the system stack interact non-trivially. Finding optimal configurations for highly configurable robots to achieve desired performance poses a significant challenge due to the interactions between configuration options across software and hardware that result in an exponentially large and complex configuration space. These challenges are further compounded by the need for transferability between different environments and robotic platforms. Data efficient optimization algorithms (e.g., Bayesian optimization) have been increasingly employed to automate the tuning of configurable parameters in cyber-physical systems. However, such optimization algorithms converge at later stages, often after exhausting the allocated budget (e.g., optimization steps, allotted time) and lacking transferability. This paper proposes CURE -- a method that identifies causally relevant configuration options, enabling the optimization process to operate in a reduced search space, thereby enabling faster optimization of robot performance. CURE abstracts the causal relationships between various configuration options and robot performance objectives by learning a causal model in the source (a low-cost environment such as the Gazebo simulator) and applying the learned knowledge to perform optimization in the target (e.g., Turtlebot 3 physical robot). We demonstrate the effectiveness and transferability of CURE by conducting experiments that involve varying degrees of deployment changes in both physical robots and simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2025</p></details> |

These surgical robots show promising capabilities; however, most of them have to limit their working volume to achieve maximum accuracy. Moreover, the visible area seen through the surgical microscope is limited and solely depends on the eye posture. If the eye posture, trocar position, and robot configuration are not correctly arranged, the instrument may not reach the target position, and the preparation will have to be redone. Therefore, this paper proposes the optimization framework of the eye tilting and the robot positioning to reach various target areas for different patients. Our method was validated with an adjustable phantom eye model, and the error of this workflow was 0.13 +/- 1.65 deg (rotational joint around Y axis), -1.40 +/- 1.13 deg (around X axis), and 1.80 +/- 1.51 mm (depth, Z). The potential error sources are also analyzed in the discussion section.</p></details> | Accepted to ICRA2025 |

When a robot lacks the necessary tools to accomplish a task requested by a human, it autonomously designs the required instruments and learns how to use them to achieve the goal. Evolution 6.0 is an autonomous robotic system powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Vision-Language Action (VLA) models, and Text-to-3D generative models for tool design and task execution. The system comprises two key modules: the Tool Generation Module, which fabricates task-specific tools from visual and textual data, and the Action Generation Module, which converts natural language instructions into robotic actions. It integrates QwenVLM for environmental understanding, OpenVLA for task execution, and Llama-Mesh for 3D tool generation. Evaluation results demonstrate a 90% success rate for tool generation with a 10-second inference time, and action generation achieving 83.5% in physical and visual generalization, 70% in motion generalization, and 37% in semantic generalization. Future improvements will focus on bimanual manipulation, expanded task capabilities, and enhanced environmental interpretation to improve real-world adaptability.</p></details> | Submitted to IROS |

While Behavior Trees (BTs) have been established as a popular control architecture and are plannable for a single robot, the development of effective multi-robot BT planning algorithms remains challenging due to the complexity of coordinating diverse action spaces. We propose the Multi-Robot Behavior Tree Planning (MRBTP) algorithm, with theoretical guarantees of both soundness and completeness. MRBTP features cross-tree expansion to coordinate heterogeneous actions across different BTs to achieve the team's goal. For homogeneous actions, we retain backup structures among BTs to ensure robustness and prevent redundant execution through intention sharing. While MRBTP is capable of generating BTs for both homogeneous and heterogeneous robot teams, its efficiency can be further improved. We then propose an optional plugin for MRBTP when Large Language Models (LLMs) are available to reason goal-related actions for each robot. These relevant actions can be pre-planned to form long-horizon subtrees, significantly enhancing the planning speed and collaboration efficiency of MRBTP. We evaluate our algorithm in warehouse management and everyday service scenarios. Results demonstrate MRBTP's robustness and execution efficiency under varying settings, as well as the ability of the pre-trained LLM to generate effective task-specific subtrees for MRBTP.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this advanced level of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), robots need to acquire and incorporate knowledge of their users' tasks and environment and adopt multimodal communication approaches with expressive cues that combine speech, movement, gazes, and other modalities. This paper presents several methods to design, enhance, and evaluate expressive HRI systems for non-humanoid industrial robots. We present the concept of a small anthropomorphic robot communicating as a proxy for its non-humanoid host, such as a forklift. We developed a multimodal and LLM-enhanced communication framework for this robot and evaluated it in several lab experiments, using gaze tracking and motion capture to quantify how users perceive the robot and measure the task progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 1st German Robotics Conference (GRC)</p></details> |

We present corobos, a proof-of-concept design that enables these robots to cooperatively transition between table (horizontal) and wall (vertical) surfaces seamlessly, without human intervention. Each robot is equipped with a uniquely designed slope structure that facilitates smooth rotation when another robot pushes it toward a target surface. Notably, this design relies solely on passive mechanical elements, eliminating the need for additional active electrical components. We investigated the design parameters of this structure and evaluated its transition success rate through experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate various application examples to showcase the potential of corobos in enhancing user environments.</p></details> | CHI 2025 |

Integrating a motorized LiDAR offers a practical solution by significantly expanding the sensor's FoV and enabling adaptive panoramic 3D sensing. However, the high-frequency vibrations of the quadruped robot introduce calibration challenges, causing variations in the LiDAR-motor transformation that degrade sensing accuracy. Existing calibration methods that use artificial targets or dense feature extraction lack feasibility for on-site applications and real-time implementation. To overcome these limitations, we propose LiMo-Calib, an efficient on-site calibration method that eliminates the need for external targets by leveraging geometric features directly from raw LiDAR scans. LiMo-Calib optimizes feature selection based on normal distribution to accelerate convergence while maintaining accuracy and incorporates a reweighting mechanism that evaluates local plane fitting quality to enhance robustness. We integrate and validate the proposed method on a motorized LiDAR system mounted on a quadruped robot, demonstrating significant improvements in calibration efficiency and 3D sensing accuracy, making LiMo-Calib well-suited for real-world robotic applications. We further demonstrate the accuracy improvements of the LIO on the panoramic 3D sensing system using the calibrated parameters. The code will be available at: https://github.com/kafeiyin00/LiMo-Calib.</p></details> |  |

While existing systems predominantly rely on software-based safety features to mitigate risks during unforeseen collisions, this study explores the use of a mechanical fail-safe to improve safety. We designed a breakaway utensil attachment that decouples forces exerted by the robot on the user when excessive forces occur. Finite element analysis (FEA) simulations were performed to predict failure points under various loading conditions, followed by experimental validation using 3D-printed attachments with variations in slot depth and wall loops. To facilitate testing, a drop test rig was developed and validated. Our results demonstrated a consistent failure point at the slot of the attachment, with a slot depth of 1 mm and three wall loops achieving failure at the target force of 65 N. Additionally, the parameters can be tailored to customize the breakaway force based on user-specific factors, such as comfort and pain tolerance.

Specifically, IBURD generates both images of underwater debris and their pixel-level annotations, using source images of debris objects, their annotations, and target background images of marine environments. With Poisson editing and style transfer techniques, IBURD is even able to robustly blend transparent objects into arbitrary backgrounds and automatically adjust the style of blended images using the blurriness metric of target background images. These generated images of marine debris in actual underwater backgrounds address the data scarcity and data variety problems faced by deep-learned vision algorithms in challenging underwater conditions, and can enable the use of AUVs for environmental cleanup missions. Both quantitative and robotic evaluations of IBURD demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for robotic detection of marine debris.</p></details> |  |

However, the data that such policies are trained on is generally of mixed quality -- not only are human-collected demonstrations unlikely to perform the task perfectly, but the larger the dataset is, the harder it is to curate only the highest quality examples. It also remains unclear how optimal data from one embodiment is for training on another embodiment. In this paper, we present a general and broadly applicable approach that enhances the performance of such generalist robot policies at deployment time by re-ranking their actions according to a value function learned via offline RL. This approach, which we call Value-Guided Policy Steering (V-GPS), is compatible with a wide range of different generalist policies, without needing to fine-tune or even access the weights of the policy. We show that the same value function can improve the performance of five different state-of-the-art policies with different architectures, even though they were trained on distinct datasets, attaining consistent performance improvement on multiple robotic platforms across a total of 12 tasks.

We developed a prototype interface, PAiREd, with a learning companion robot to deliver LLM-generated educational content that can be reviewed and revised by parents. Parents can flexibly adjust their involvement in the activity by determining what they want the robot to help with. We conducted an in-home field study involving 20 families with children aged 3-5. Our work contributes to an empirical understanding of the level of support parents with different expectations may need from AI and robots and a prototype that demonstrates an innovative interaction paradigm for flexibly including parents in supporting their children.</p></details> |  |

Cosserat Rod Theory has emerged as a prominent framework for modeling these robots efficiently, representing continuum soft robots as time-varying curves, known as backbones. In this work, we propose viewing the robot's backbone as a signal in space and time, applying the Fourier transform to describe its deformation compactly. This approach unifies existing modeling strategies within the Cosserat Rod Theory framework, offering insights into commonly used heuristic methods. Moreover, the Fourier transform enables the development of a data-driven methodology to experimentally capture the robot's deformation. The proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations and experiments on a real-world prototype, demonstrating a reduction in the degrees of freedom while preserving the accuracy of the deformation representation.</p></details> |  |

In general, feasible regions for accomplishing tasks within complex high-dimensional spaces are exceedingly narrow. For instance, in the context of humanoid robot motion control, the vast majority of space corresponds to falling, while only a minuscule fraction corresponds to standing upright, which is conducive to the completion of downstream tasks. Once the robot explores into a potentially task-relevant region, it should place greater emphasis on the data within that region. Building on this insight, we propose the $\textbf{S}$elf-$\textbf{I}$mitative $\textbf{R}$einforcement $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{SIRL}$) framework, where the RL algorithm also imitates potentially task-relevant trajectories. Specifically, trajectory return is utilized to determine its relevance to the task and an additional behavior cloning is adopted whose weight is dynamically adjusted based on the trajectory return. As a result, our proposed algorithm achieves 120% performance improvement on the challenging HumanoidBench with 5% extra computation overhead. With further visualization, we find the significant performance gain does lead to meaningful behavior improvement that several tasks are solved successfully.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we extend the concept of inverse kinematics to guiding vector fields for path following in autonomous mobile robots. The desired path is defined by its implicit equation, i.e., by a collection of points belonging to one or more zero-level sets. These level sets serve as a reference to construct an error signal that drives the guiding vector field toward the desired path, enabling the robot to converge and travel along the path by following such a vector field. We start with the formal exposition on how inverse kinematics can be applied to guiding vector fields for single-integrator robots in an m-dimensional Euclidean space. Then, we leverage inverse kinematics to ensure that the level-set error signal behaves as a linear system, facilitating control over the robot's transient motion toward the desired path and allowing for the injection of feed-forward signals to induce precise motion behavior along the path. We then propose solutions to the theoretical and practical challenges of applying this technique to unicycles with constant speeds to follow 2D paths with precise transient control. We finish by validating the predicted theoretical results through real flights with fixed-wing drones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Yu Zh...</summary><p>Yu Zhou and Jes\'us Bautista contributed equally to this work.

Mapping and navigation, as the key foundation for air-ground collaborative robots to achieve efficient task execution, have attracted a great deal of attention. This growing interest in collaborative robot mapping and navigation is conducive to improving the intelligence of fire and rescue task execution, but there has been no comprehensive investigation of this field to highlight their strengths. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the ground-to-ground cooperative robots for fire and rescue from a new perspective of mapping and navigation. First, an air-ground collaborative robots framework for fire and rescue missions based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mapping and unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation is introduced. Then, the research progress of mapping and navigation under this framework is systematically summarized, including UAV mapping, UAV/UGV co-localization, and UGV navigation, with their main achievements and limitations. Based on the needs of fire and rescue missions, the collaborative robots with different numbers of UAVs and UGVs are classified, and their practicality in fire and rescue tasks is elaborated, with a focus on the discussion of their merits and demerits. In addition, the application examples of air-ground collaborative robots in various firefighting and rescue scenarios are given. Finally, this paper emphasizes the current challenges and potential research opportunities, rounding up references for practitioners and researchers willing to engage in this vibrant area of air-ground collaborative robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 20 figures; This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Robotic Assembly Sequence Planning: A Sequential Decision-Making Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17115v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimal robot assembly planning problem is challenging due to the necessity of finding the optimal solution amongst an exponentially vast number of possible plans, all while satisfying a selection of constraints. Traditionally, robotic assembly planning problems have been solved using heuristics, but these methods are specific to a given objective structure or set of problem parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to robotic assembly planning that poses assembly sequencing as a sequential decision making problem, enabling us to harness methods that far outperform the state-of-the-art. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize Dynamic Programming (DP) to find optimal assembly policies for moderately sized strictures. We further expand our framework to exploit the deterministic nature of assembly planning and introduce a class of optimal Graph Exploration Assembly Planners (GEAPs). For larger structures, we show how Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables us to learn policies that generate high reward assembly sequences. We evaluate our approach on a variety of robotic assembly problems, such as the assembly of the Hubble Space Telescope, the International Space Station, and the James Webb Space Telescope. We further showcase how our DP, GEAP, and RL implementations are capable of finding optimal solutions under a variety of different objective functions and how our formulation allows us to translate precedence constraints to branch pruning and thus further improve performance. We have published our code at https://github.com/labicon/ORASP-Code.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 con...</summary><p>6 conference page paper, 3 page appendix, 23 figures, IROS 2024</p></details> |

Detecting and recovering from these failures is crucial for maintaining effective level of trust from users. However, robots may fail without being aware of it. One way to detect such failures could be by analysing humans' non-verbal behaviours and reactions to failures. This study investigates how human gaze dynamics can signal a robot's failure and examines how different types of failures affect people's perception of robot. We conducted a user study with 27 participants collaborating with a robotic mobile manipulator to solve tangram puzzles. The robot was programmed to experience two types of failures -- executional and decisional -- occurring either at the beginning or end of the task, with or without acknowledgement of the failure. Our findings reveal that the type and timing of the robot's failure significantly affect participants' gaze behaviour and perception of the robot. Specifically, executional failures led to more gaze shifts and increased focus on the robot, while decisional failures resulted in lower entropy in gaze transitions among areas of interest, particularly when the failure occurred at the end of the task. These results highlight that gaze can serve as a reliable indicator of robot failures and their types, and could also be used to predict the appropriate recovery actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>this ...</summary><p>this paper is accepted in HRI conference as a full paper</p></details> |

Achieving high performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency remains a significant challenge, particularly in scenarios involving intensive contacts and stiff interactions. In this article, we introduce a new class of multi-contact NCP solvers based on the theory of the Augmented Lagrangian (AL). We detail how the standard derivation of AL in convex optimization can be adapted to handle multi-contact NCP through the iteration of surrogate problem solutions and the subsequent update of primal-dual variables. Specifically, we present two tailored variations of AL for robotic simulations: the Cascaded Newton-based Augmented Lagrangian (CANAL) and the Subsystem-based Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (SubADMM). We demonstrate how CANAL can manage multi-contact NCP in an accurate and robust manner, while SubADMM offers superior computational speed, scalability, and parallelizability for high degrees-of-freedom multibody systems with numerous contacts. Our results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed solver framework, illustrating its advantages in various robotic manipulation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The approach formulates the optimization problem to minimize the sum of residuals between actual and predicted states parameterized by the friction coefficient in rigid body contact dynamics. Notably, the proposed framework leverages the analytic smoothed gradient of contact impulses, obtained by smoothing the complementarity condition of Coulomb friction, to solve the issue of non-informative gradients induced from the nonsmooth contact dynamics. Moreover, we introduce the rejection method to filter out data with high normal contact velocity following contact initiations during friction coefficient identification for legged robots. To validate the proposed framework, we conduct the experiments using a quadrupedal robot platform, KAIST HOUND, on slippery and nonslippery terrain. We observe that our framework achieves fast and consistent friction coefficient identification within various initial conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, IEEE RA-L (2025) accepted</p></details> |

However, existing datasets primarily focus on elementary tasks like object pointing and pushing, limiting their applicability to complex domains. They prioritize simpler human command data but place less emphasis on training robots to correctly interpret tasks and respond appropriately. To address these gaps, we present the NatSGLD dataset, which was collected using a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) method, where participants interacted with a robot they believed to be autonomous. NatSGLD records humans' multimodal commands (speech and gestures), each paired with a demonstration trajectory and a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula that provides a ground-truth interpretation of the commanded tasks. This dataset serves as a foundational resource for research at the intersection of HRI and machine learning. By providing multimodal inputs and detailed annotations, NatSGLD enables exploration in areas such as multimodal instruction following, plan recognition, and human-advisable reinforcement learning from demonstrations. We release the dataset and code under the MIT License at https://www.snehesh.com/natsgld/ to support future HRI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2403.02274</p></details> |
| **[Reflective Planning: Vision-Language Models for Multi-Stage Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16707v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving complex long-horizon robotic manipulation problems requires sophisticated high-level planning capabilities, the ability to reason about the physical world, and reactively choose appropriate motor skills. Vision-language models (VLMs) pretrained on Internet data could in principle offer a framework for tackling such problems. However, in their current form, VLMs lack both the nuanced understanding of intricate physics required for robotic manipulation and the ability to reason over long horizons to address error compounding issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time computation framework that enhances VLMs' physical reasoning capabilities for multi-stage manipulation tasks. At its core, our approach iteratively improves a pretrained VLM with a "reflection" mechanism - it uses a generative model to imagine future world states, leverages these predictions to guide action selection, and critically reflects on potential suboptimalities to refine its reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art commercial VLMs as well as other post-training approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

| **[Phase-Independent Dynamic Movement Primitives With Applications to Human-Robot Co-manipulation and Time Optimal Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08238v3)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) are an established and efficient method for encoding robotic tasks that require adaptation based on reference motions. Typically, the nominal trajectory is obtained through Programming by Demonstration (PbD), where the robot learns a task via kinesthetic guidance and reproduces it in terms of both geometric path and timing law. Modifying the duration of the execution in standard DMPs is achieved by adjusting a time constant in the model. This paper introduces a novel approach to fully decouple the geometric information of a task from its temporal information using an algorithm called spatial sampling, which allows parameterizing the demonstrated curve by its arc-length. This leads to the definition of the Geometric DMP (GDMP). The proposed spatial sampling algorithm guarantees the regularity of the demonstrated curve and ensures a consistent projection of the human force throughout the task in a human-in-the-loop scenario. GDMP exhibits phase independence, as its phase variable is no longer constrained to the demonstration's timing law, enabling a wide range of applications, including phase optimization problems and human-in-the-loop applications. Firstly, a minimum task duration optimization problem subject to velocity and acceleration constraints is formulated. The decoupling of path and speed in GDMP allows to achieve optimal time duration without violating the constraints. Secondly, GDMP is validated in a human-in-the-loop application, providing a theoretical passivity analysis and an experimental stability evaluation in co-manipulation tasks. Finally, GDMP is compared with other DMP architectures available in the literature, both for the phase optimization problem and experimentally with reference to an insertion task, showcasing the enhanced performance of GDMP with respect to other solutions.</p></details> | 18 pages, 18 figures |

Existing work often overlooks the differences between humans and robots, producing unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we study how perfectly aligned human-robot pairs benefit robot learning. Capitalizing on VR-based teleportation, we introduce H\&R, a third-person dataset with 2,600 episodes, each of which captures the fine-grained correspondence between human hands and robot gripper. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models, we introduce Human2Robot, an end-to-end diffusion framework that formulates learning from human demonstrates as a generative task. Human2Robot fully explores temporal dynamics in human videos to generate robot videos and predict actions at the same time. Through comprehensive evaluations of 8 seen, changed and unseen tasks in real-world settings, we demonstrate that Human2Robot can not only generate high-quality robot videos but also excel in seen tasks and generalize to unseen objects, backgrounds and even new tasks effortlessly.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, studying vision-based underwater robot navigation and control has recently gained increasing attention to counter the numerous challenges faced in underwater conditions, such as lighting variability, turbidity, camera image distortions (due to bubbles), and ROV positional disturbances (due to underwater currents). In this paper, we propose (to the best of our knowledge) a first rigorous unified benchmarking of more than seven Machine Learning (ML)-based one-shot object tracking algorithms for vision-based position locking of ROV platforms. We propose a position-locking system that processes images of an object of interest in front of which the ROV must be kept stable. Then, our proposed system uses the output result of different object tracking algorithms to automatically correct the position of the ROV against external disturbances. We conducted numerous real-world experiments using a BlueROV2 platform within an indoor pool and provided clear demonstrations of the strengths and weaknesses of each tracking approach. Finally, to help alleviate the scarcity of underwater ROV data, we release our acquired data base as open-source with the hope of benefiting future research.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements have explored diverse reward function designs, training techniques, simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfers, and performance analysis methodologies, yet these still require significant human intervention. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for training and deploying RL policies, guided by Large Language Models (LLMs), and evaluates its effectiveness on bipedal robots. The framework consists of three interconnected modules: an LLM-guided reward function design module, an RL training module leveraging prior work, and a sim-to-real homomorphic evaluation module. This design significantly reduces the need for human input by utilizing only essential simulation and deployment platforms, with the option to incorporate human-engineered strategies and historical data. We detail the construction of these modules, their advantages over traditional approaches, and demonstrate the framework's capability to autonomously develop and refine controlling strategies for bipedal robot locomotion, showcasing its potential to operate independently of human intervention.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods predominantly schedule robots' movements based on reactive stimuli or simplified gas plume models. These approaches typically excel in idealized, simulated environments but fall short in real-world gas environments characterized by their patchy distribution. In this work, we introduce SniffySquad, a multi-robot olfaction-based system designed to address the inherent patchiness in gas source localization. SniffySquad incorporates a patchiness-aware active sensing approach that enhances the quality of data collection and estimation. Moreover, it features an innovative collaborative role adaptation strategy to boost the efficiency of source-seeking endeavors. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves an increase in the success rate by $20\%+$ and an improvement in path efficiency by $30\%+$, outperforming state-of-the-art gas source localization solutions.</p></details> |  |

However, recent Sim2real methods either rely on a large amount of augmented data or large learning models, which is inefficient for specific tasks. In recent years, with the emergence of radiance field reconstruction methods, especially 3D Gaussian splatting, it has become possible to construct realistic real-world scenes. To this end, we propose RL-GSBridge, a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework which incorporates 3D Gaussian Splatting into the conventional RL simulation pipeline, enabling zero-shot sim-to-real transfer for vision-based deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a mesh-based 3D GS method with soft binding constraints, enhancing the rendering quality of mesh models. Then utilizing a GS editing approach to synchronize the rendering with the physics simulator, RL-GSBridge could reflect the visual interactions of the physical robot accurately. Through a series of sim-to-real experiments, including grasping and pick-and-place tasks, we demonstrate that RL-GSBridge maintains a satisfactory success rate in real-world task completion during sim-to-real transfer. Furthermore, a series of rendering metrics and visualization results indicate that our proposed mesh-based 3D GS reduces artifacts in unstructured objects, demonstrating more realistic rendering performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

However, its deployment on physical robots remains challenging due to safety risks and the comparatively high costs of training. To avoid these problems, RL agents are often trained on simulators, which introduces a new problem related to the gap between simulation and reality. This paper presents an RL pipeline designed to help reduce the reality gap and facilitate developing and deploying RL policies for real-world robotic systems. The pipeline organizes the RL training process into an initial step for system identification and three training stages: core simulation training, high-fidelity simulation, and real-world deployment, each adding levels of realism to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Each training stage takes an input policy, improves it, and either passes the improved policy to the next stage or loops it back for further improvement. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves the desired performance. The pipeline's effectiveness is shown through a case study with the Boston Dynamics Spot mobile robot used in a surveillance application. The case study presents the steps taken at each pipeline stage to obtain an RL agent to control the robot's position and orientation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to be presented at IEEE SysCon 2025</p></details> |

Acting relies on skills to implement and to model the activities it oversees: refinement, local recovery, temporal dispatching, external asynchronous events, and commands execution, all done online. While sitting between planning and the robotic platform, acting often relies on programming primitives and an interpreter which executes these skills. Following our experience in providing a formal framework to program the functional components of our robots, we propose a new language, to program the acting skills. This language maps unequivocally into a formal model which can then be used to check properties offline or execute the skills, or more precisely their formal equivalent, and perform runtime verification. We illustrate with a real example how we can program a survey mission for a drone in this new language, prove some formal properties on the program and directly execute the formal model on the drone to perform the mission.</p></details> |  |

This collaborative learning in real-world environments requires social robots to adapt dynamically to changing and unpredictable situations and varying task settings. Our work contributes to addressing these challenges by exploring a simulated living room environment where robots need to learn the social appropriateness of their actions. First, we propose Federated Root (FedRoot) averaging, a novel weight aggregation strategy which disentangles feature learning across clients from individual task-based learning. Second, to adapt to challenging environments, we extend FedRoot to Federated Latent Generative Replay (FedLGR), a novel Federated Continual Learning (FCL) strategy that uses FedRoot-based weight aggregation and embeds each client with a generator model for pseudo-rehearsal of learnt feature embeddings to mitigate forgetting in a resource-efficient manner. Our results show that FedRoot-based methods offer competitive performance while also resulting in a sizeable reduction in resource consumption (up to 86% for CPU usage and up to 72% for GPU usage). Additionally, our results demonstrate that FedRoot-based FCL methods outperform other methods while also offering an efficient solution (up to 84% CPU and 92% GPU usage reduction), with FedLGR providing the best results across evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, IEEE RA-L submission</p></details> |

In robotics, microvibrations have traditionally been interpreted as a marker for object slip, and recently as a salient indicator of extrinsic contact. We present the first-ever robotic fingertip making use of SMI for slip and extrinsic contact sensing. The design is validated through measurement of controlled vibration sources, both before and after encasing the readout circuit in its fingertip package. Then, the SMI fingertip is compared to acoustic sensing through four experiments. The results are distilled into a technology decision map.

| **[Highly dynamic physical interaction for robotics: design and control of an active remote center of compliance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10024v4)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot interaction control is often limited to low dynamics or low flexibility, depending on whether an active or passive approach is chosen. In this work, we introduce a hybrid control scheme that combines the advantages of active and passive interaction control. To accomplish this, we propose the design of a novel Active Remote Center of Compliance (ARCC), which is based on a passive and active element which can be used to directly control the interaction forces. We introduce surrogate models for a dynamic comparison against purely robot-based interaction schemes. In a comparative validation, ARCC drastically improves the interaction dynamics, leading to an increase in the motion bandwidth of up to 31 times. We introduce further our control approach as well as the integration in the robot controller. Finally, we analyze ARCC on different industrial benchmarks like peg-in-hole, top-hat rail assembly and contour following problems and compare it against the state of the art, to highlight the dynamic and flexibility. The proposed system is especially suited if the application requires a low cycle time combined with a sensitive manipulation.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |
| **[ChatVLA: Unified Multimodal Understanding and Robot Control with Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14420v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans possess a unified cognitive ability to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. Why can't large language models replicate this holistic understanding? Through a systematic analysis of existing training paradigms in vision-language-action models (VLA), we identify two key challenges: spurious forgetting, where robot training overwrites crucial visual-text alignments, and task interference, where competing control and understanding tasks degrade performance when trained jointly. To overcome these limitations, we propose ChatVLA, a novel framework featuring Phased Alignment Training, which incrementally integrates multimodal data after initial control mastery, and a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to minimize task interference. ChatVLA demonstrates competitive performance on visual question-answering datasets and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) methods on multimodal understanding benchmarks. Notably, it achieves a six times higher performance on MMMU and scores 47.2% on MMStar with a more parameter-efficient design than ECoT. Furthermore, ChatVLA demonstrates superior performance on 25 real-world robot manipulation tasks compared to existing VLA methods like OpenVLA. Our findings highlight the potential of our unified framework for achieving both robust multimodal understanding and effective robot control.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLAS: Vision-Language-Action Model With Speech Instructions For Customized Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13508v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have become increasingly popular in robot manipulation for their end-to-end design and remarkable performance. However, existing VLAs rely heavily on vision-language models (VLMs) that only support text-based instructions, neglecting the more natural speech modality for human-robot interaction. Traditional speech integration methods usually involves a separate speech recognition system, which complicates the model and introduces error propagation. Moreover, the transcription procedure would lose non-semantic information in the raw speech, such as voiceprint, which may be crucial for robots to successfully complete customized tasks. To overcome above challenges, we propose VLAS, a novel end-to-end VLA that integrates speech recognition directly into the robot policy model. VLAS allows the robot to understand spoken commands through inner speech-text alignment and produces corresponding actions to fulfill the task. We also present two new datasets, SQA and CSI, to support a three-stage tuning process for speech instructions, which empowers VLAS with the ability of multimodal interaction across text, image, speech, and robot actions. Taking a step further, a voice retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm is designed to enable our model to effectively handle tasks that require individual-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments show that VLAS can effectively accomplish robot manipulation tasks with diverse speech commands, offering a seamless and customized interaction experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Realm: Real-Time Line-of-Sight Maintenance in Multi-Robot Navigation with Unknown Obstacles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15162v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot navigation in complex environments relies on inter-robot communication and mutual observations for coordination and situational awareness. This paper studies the multi-robot navigation problem in unknown environments with line-of-sight (LoS) connectivity constraints. While previous works are limited to known environment models to derive the LoS constraints, this paper eliminates such requirements by directly formulating the LoS constraints between robots from their real-time point cloud measurements, leveraging point cloud visibility analysis techniques. We propose a novel LoS-distance metric to quantify both the urgency and sensitivity of losing LoS between robots considering potential robot movements. Moreover, to address the imbalanced urgency of losing LoS between two robots, we design a fusion function to capture the overall urgency while generating gradients that facilitate robots' collaborative movement to maintain LoS. The LoS constraints are encoded into a potential function that preserves the positivity of the Fiedler eigenvalue of the robots' network graph to ensure connectivity. Finally, we establish a LoS-constrained exploration framework that integrates the proposed connectivity controller. We showcase its applications in multi-robot exploration in complex unknown environments, where robots can always maintain the LoS connectivity through distributed sensing and communication, while collaboratively mapping the unknown environment. The implementations are open-sourced at https://github.com/bairuofei/LoS_constrained_navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, accepted by IEEE ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Synergistic Framework for Learning Shape Estimation and Shape-Aware Whole-Body Control Policy for Continuum Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03859v4)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel synergistic framework for learning shape estimation and a shape-aware whole-body control policy for tendon-driven continuum robots. Our approach leverages the interaction between two Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ANODEs) -- the Shape-NODE and Control-NODE -- to achieve continuous shape estimation and shape-aware control. The Shape-NODE integrates prior knowledge from Cosserat rod theory, allowing it to adapt and account for model mismatches, while the Control-NODE uses this shape information to optimize a whole-body control policy, trained in a Model Predictive Control (MPC) fashion. This unified framework effectively overcomes limitations of existing data-driven methods, such as poor shape awareness and challenges in capturing complex nonlinear dynamics. Extensive evaluations in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the framework's robust performance in shape estimation, trajectory tracking, and obstacle avoidance. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art end-to-end, Neural-ODE, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, particularly in terms of tracking accuracy and generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[A novel step-by-step procedure for the kinematic calibration of robots using a single draw-wire encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14983v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot positioning accuracy is a key factory when performing high-precision manufacturing tasks. To effectively improve the accuracy of a manipulator, often up to a value close to its repeatability, calibration plays a crucial role. In the literature, various approaches to robot calibration have been proposed, and they range considerably in the type of measurement system and identification algorithm used. Our aim was to develop a novel step-by-step kinematic calibration procedure - where the parameters are subsequently estimated one at a time - that only uses 1D distance measurement data obtained through a draw-wire encoder. To pursue this objective, we derived an analytical approach to find, for each unknown parameter, a set of calibration points where the discrepancy between the measured and predicted distances only depends on that unknown parameter. This reduces the computational burden of the identification process while potentially improving its accuracy. Simulations and experimental tests were carried out on a 6 degrees-of-freedom robot arm: the results confirmed the validity of the proposed strategy. As a result, the proposed step-by-step calibration approach represents a practical, cost-effective and computationally less demanding alternative to standard calibration approaches, making robot calibration more accessible and easier to perform.</p></details> |  |

The architecture and connectivity of the MI-HGNN are constructed from the robot morphology, in which nodes and edges are robot joints and links, respectively. By incorporating the morphology-informed constraints into a neural network, we improve a learning-based approach using model-based knowledge. We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness, generalization ability, model efficiency, and sample efficiency. Our MI-HGNN improved the performance of a state-of-the-art model that leverages robot morphological symmetry by 8.4% with only 0.21% of its parameters. Although MI-HGNN is applied to contact perception problems for legged robots in this work, it can be seamlessly applied to other types of multi-body dynamical systems and has the potential to improve other robot learning frameworks. Our code is made publicly available at https://github.com/lunarlab-gatech/Morphology-Informed-HGNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures; This work has been accepted to ICRA 2025 and will soon be published</p></details> |
| **[Learning Low-Dimensional Strain Models of Soft Robots by Looking at the Evolution of Their Shape with Application to Model-Based Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00138v4)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obtaining dynamic models of continuum soft robots is central to the analysis and control of soft robots, and researchers have devoted much attention to the challenge of proposing both data-driven and first-principle solutions. Both avenues have, however, shown their limitations; the former lacks structure and performs poorly outside training data, while the latter requires significant simplifications and extensive expert knowledge to be used in practice. This paper introduces a streamlined method for learning low-dimensional, physics-based models that are both accurate and easy to interpret. We start with an algorithm that uses image data (i.e., shape evolutions) to determine the minimal necessary segments for describing a soft robot's movement. Following this, we apply a dynamic regression and strain sparsification algorithm to identify relevant strains and define the model's dynamics. We validate our approach through simulations with various planar soft manipulators, comparing its performance against other learning strategies, showing that our models are both computationally efficient and 25x more accurate on out-of-training distribution inputs. Finally, we demonstrate that thanks to the capability of the method of generating physically compatible models, the learned models can be straightforwardly combined with model-based control policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, appearing in Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE 8th International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)</p></details> |
