| **[Reconstructing 4D Spatial Intelligence: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21045v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date project page: https://github.com/yukangcao/Awesome-4D-Spatial-Intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yukangcao/Awesome-4D-Spatial-Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[MazeEval: A Benchmark for Testing Sequential Decision-Making in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20395v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Salsa as a Nonverbal Embodied Language -- The CoMPAS3D Dataset and Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19684v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human, adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive, expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types, combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation) generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive humanoid motion generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://rosielab.github.io/compas3d</p></details> |
| **[Advances in 4D Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14501v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative artificial intelligence has recently progressed from static image and video synthesis to 3D content generation, culminating in the emergence of 4D generation-the task of synthesizing temporally coherent dynamic 3D assets guided by user input. As a burgeoning research frontier, 4D generation enables richer interactive and immersive experiences, with applications ranging from digital humans to autonomous driving. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks a unified understanding of 4D representations, generative frameworks, basic paradigms, and the core technical challenges it faces. This survey provides a systematic and in-depth review of the 4D generation landscape. To comprehensively characterize 4D generation, we first categorize fundamental 4D representations and outline associated techniques for 4D generation. We then present an in-depth analysis of representative generative pipelines based on conditions and representation methods. Subsequently, we discuss how motion and geometry priors are integrated into 4D outputs to ensure spatio-temporal consistency under various control schemes. From an application perspective, this paper summarizes 4D generation tasks in areas such as dynamic object/scene generation, digital human synthesis, editable 4D content, and embodied AI. Furthermore, we summarize and multi-dimensionally compare four basic paradigms for 4D generation: End-to-End, Generated-Data-Based, Implicit-Distillation-Based, and Explicit-Supervision-Based. Concluding our analysis, we highlight five key challenges-consistency, controllability, diversity, efficiency, and fidelity-and contextualize these with current approaches.By distilling recent advances and outlining open problems, this work offers a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective to guide future research in 4D generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[BoxFusion: Reconstruction-Free Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection via Real-Time Multi-View Box Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15610v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> |
| **[ThinkAct: Vision-Language-Action Reasoning via Reinforced Visual Latent Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16815v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jasper0314-huang.github.io/thinkact-vla/</p></details> |
| **[Towards provable probabilistic safety for scalable embodied AI systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05171v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. Instead, empirical safety evaluation is employed as an alternative, but the absence of provable guarantees imposes significant limitations. To address these issues, we argue for a paradigm shift to provable probabilistic safety that integrates provable guarantees with progressive achievement toward a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance. The new paradigm better leverages statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability, and a well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for provable probabilistic safety, along with corresponding challenges and potential solutions. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, this Perspective offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Streaming Video Representation via Multitask Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20041v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding continuous video streams plays a fundamental role in real-time applications including embodied AI and autonomous driving. Unlike offline video understanding, streaming video understanding requires the ability to process video streams frame by frame, preserve historical information, and make low-latency decisions. To address these challenges, our main contributions are three-fold. (i) We develop a novel streaming video backbone, termed as StreamFormer, by incorporating causal temporal attention into a pre-trained vision transformer. This enables efficient streaming video processing while maintaining image representation capability. (ii) To train StreamFormer, we propose to unify diverse spatial-temporal video understanding tasks within a multitask visual-language alignment framework. Hence, StreamFormer learns global semantics, temporal dynamics, and fine-grained spatial relationships simultaneously. (iii) We conduct extensive experiments on online action detection, online video instance segmentation, and video question answering. StreamFormer achieves competitive results while maintaining efficiency, demonstrating its potential for real-time applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

| **[PR2: A Physics- and Photo-realistic Humanoid Testbed with Pilot Study in Competition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01559v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the development of a Physics-realistic and Photo-realistic humanoid robot testbed, PR2, to facilitate collaborative research between Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) and robotics. PR2 offers high-quality scene rendering and robot dynamic simulation, enabling (i) the creation of diverse scenes using various digital assets, (ii) the integration of advanced perception or foundation models, and (iii) the implementation of planning and control algorithms for dynamic humanoid robot behaviors based on environmental feedback. The beta version of PR2 has been deployed for the simulation track of a nationwide full-size humanoid robot competition for college students, attracting 137 teams and over 400 participants within four months. This competition covered traditional tasks in bipedal walking, as well as novel challenges in loco-manipulation and language-instruction-based object search, marking a first for public college robotics competitions. A retrospective analysis of the competition suggests that future events should emphasize the integration of locomotion with manipulation and perception. By making the PR2 testbed publicly available at https://github.com/pr2-humanoid/PR2-Platform, we aim to further advance education and training in humanoid robotics.

| **[EgoPrune: Efficient Token Pruning for Egomotion Video Reasoning in Embodied Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15428v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egomotion videos are first-person recordings where the view changes continuously due to the agent's movement. As they serve as the primary visual input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning. EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering (PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover, we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for on-device egomotion video reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysX-3D: Physical-Grounded 3D Asset Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12465v3)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \textbf{PhysX-3D}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research in generative physical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://physx-3d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[WMNav: Integrating Vision-Language Models into World Models for Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02247v5)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Goal Navigation-requiring an agent to locate a specific object in an unseen environment-remains a core challenge in embodied AI. Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

| **[The Duality of Generative AI and Reinforcement Learning in Robotics: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16411v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, generative AI and reinforcement learning (RL) have been redefining what is possible for AI agents that take information flows as input and produce intelligent behavior. As a result, we are seeing similar advancements in embodied AI and robotics for control policy generation. Our review paper examines the integration of generative AI models with RL to advance robotics. Our primary focus is on the duality between generative AI and RL for robotics downstream tasks. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The role of prominent generative AI tools as modular priors for multi-modal input fusion in RL tasks. (2) How RL can train, fine-tune and distill generative models for policy generation, such as VLA models, similarly to RL applications in large language models. We then propose a new taxonomy based on a considerable amount of selected papers. Lastly, we identify open challenges accounting for model scalability, adaptation and grounding, giving recommendations and insights on future research directions. We reflect on which generative AI models best fit the RL tasks and why. On the other side, we reflect on important issues inherent to RL-enhanced generative policies, such as safety concerns and failure modes, and what are the limitations of current methods.

| **[STI-Bench: Are MLLMs Ready for Precise Spatial-Temporal World Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23765v6)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[HIS-GPT: Towards 3D Human-In-Scene Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12955v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new task to benchmark human-in-scene understanding for embodied agents: Human-In-Scene Question Answering (HIS-QA). Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.

| **[A Survey: Learning Embodied Intelligence from Physical Simulators and World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00917v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) has placed embodied intelligence at the forefront of robotics research. Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems.

| **[RoboBrain 2.0 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02029v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce RoboBrain 2.0, our latest generation of embodied vision-language foundation models, designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents.

| **[View Invariant Learning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08831v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training method.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[NavComposer: Composing Language Instructions for Navigation Trajectories through Action-Scene-Object Modularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10894v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-guided navigation is a cornerstone of embodied AI, enabling agents to interpret language instructions and navigate complex environments. However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Building on this, we propose a new guiding question: "Can machines react?" and introduce the React to This (RTT) test for nonverbal behaviors, presenting results from an initial experiment.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Reasoning for Embodied Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22050v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Long-term Point Tracking in the Foundation Model Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09217v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However, real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets, offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines. However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time. Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks, demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.18487</p></details> |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models.

Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research. Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite. S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic planning.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoramic images, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 48 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing SOTA TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |
| **[A Neural Representation Framework with LLM-Driven Spatial Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06719v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical feature field. This field represents language and instance features using distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations, outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their spatial reasoning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamArt: Generating Interactable Articulated Objects from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05763v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR. Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated asset generation.

With PAPRLE, a user can change the arrangement of the robotic limbs, and control them using a variety of input devices, including puppeteers, gaming controllers, and VR-based interfaces. This versatility supports a wide range of teleoperation scenarios and promotes adaptability to different task requirements. To further enhance configurability, we introduce a pluggable puppeteer device that can be easily mounted and adapted to match the target robot configurations. PAPRLE supports bilateral teleoperation through these puppeteer devices, agnostic to the type or configuration of the follower robot. By supporting both joint-space and task-space control, the system provides real-time force feedback, improving user fidelity and physical interaction awareness. The modular design of PAPRLE facilitates novel spatial arrangements of the limbs and enables scalable data collection, thereby advancing research in embodied AI and learning-based control. We validate PAPRLE in various real-world settings, demonstrating its versatility across diverse combinations of leader devices and follower robots. The system will be released as open source, including both hardware and software components, to support broader adoption and community-driven extension.

However, collecting such embodied data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner, a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap. It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74% compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by 89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning.

These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices, and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings, which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents, allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free Generation of Temporally Consistent Rewards from VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04789v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks, demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://t2-vlm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in robotic reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection, while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment, which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic RL.</p></details> |  |

This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

While single-arm systems have shown strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025.

Existing techniques generatively re-render the input video to realize the transfer, such as video relighting models and conditioned world generation models. Nevertheless, these models are predominantly limited to the domain of training data (e.g., portrait) or fall into the bottleneck of temporal consistency and computation efficiency, especially when the input video involves complex dynamics and long durations. In this paper, we propose TC-Light, a novel generative renderer to overcome these problems. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark.

Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking, space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings, leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend. We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.</p></details> |  |

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets and algorithms approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered in the research field. In this work, we address this shortcoming by introducing: (1) Articulate3D, an expertly curated 3D dataset featuring high-quality manual annotations on 280 indoor scenes. Articulate3D provides 8 types of annotations for articulated objects, covering parts and detailed motion information, all stored in a standardized scene representation format designed for scalable 3D content creation, exchange and seamless integration into simulation environments. (2) USDNet, a novel unified framework capable of simultaneously predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes for articulated objects. We evaluate USDNet on Articulate3D as well as two existing datasets, demonstrating the advantage of our unified dense prediction approach. Furthermore, we highlight the value of Articulate3D through cross-dataset and cross-domain evaluations and showcase its applicability in downstream tasks such as scene editing through LLM prompting and robotic policy training for articulated object manipulation.

Current language model-based navigation systems operate on discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights multi-step future actions.

| **[From 2D to 3D Cognition: A Brief Survey of General World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20134v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models have garnered increasing attention in the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), serving as computational frameworks for learning representations of the external world and forecasting future states. While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent 3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward 3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing 3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in 3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning, and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing more robust and generalizable 3D world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Multi-sensor Fusion Perception for Embodied AI: Background, Methods, Challenges and Prospects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19769v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI, which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion, while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods. A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

The recent rise of AI scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning, and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration, and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven science.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting 19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks. We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs in practical applications such as robotics and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional cloud-based telerobotics suffers from latency, reliability, scalability, and resilience issues, hindering real-time performance in critical applications. Cloud-Fog Telerobotics (CFTel) builds on the Cloud-Fog Automation (CFA) paradigm to address these limitations by leveraging a distributed Cloud-Edge-Robotics computing architecture, enabling deterministic connectivity, deterministic connected intelligence, and deterministic networked computing. This paper synthesizes recent advancements in CFTel, aiming to highlight its role in facilitating scalable, low-latency, autonomous, and AI-driven telerobotics. We analyze architectural frameworks and technologies that enable them, including 5G Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication, Edge Intelligence, Embodied AI, and Digital Twins. The study demonstrates that CFTel has the potential to enhance real-time control, scalability, and autonomy while supporting service-oriented solutions. We also discuss practical challenges, including latency constraints, cybersecurity risks, interoperability issues, and standardization efforts.

| **[Adapting Vision-Language Models for Evaluating World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17967v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable, semantics-aware evaluator for world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Embodied AI: Advances and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05108v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in simulation platforms have greatly enhanced task diversity to train embodied Vision Language Models (VLMs), most platforms rely on simplified robot morphologies and bypass the stochastic nature of low-level execution, which limits their transferability to real-world robots. To address these issues, we present a physics-based simulation platform DualTHOR for complex dual-arm humanoid robots, built upon an extended version of AI2-THOR. Our simulator includes real-world robot assets, a task suite for dual-arm collaboration, and inverse kinematics solvers for humanoid robots. We also introduce a contingency mechanism that incorporates potential failures through physics-based low-level execution, bridging the gap to real-world scenarios. Our simulator enables a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness and generalization of VLMs in household environments. Extensive evaluations reveal that current VLMs struggle with dual-arm coordination and exhibit limited robustness in realistic environments with contingencies, highlighting the importance of using our simulator to develop more capable VLMs for embodied tasks.

| **[Efficient and Generalizable Environmental Understanding for Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15377v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality, introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

Despite the progress made by existing methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results, their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning (WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their capabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and deformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the lack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under diverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for generating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac features a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional tactile sensors \sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip detection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips. Furthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis pipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based on this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm robotic system. Experiments demonstrate that PP-Tac can effectively grasp paper-like objects of varying material, thickness, and stiffness, achieving an overall success rate of 87.5\%. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to grasp paper-like deformable objects using a tactile dexterous hand.

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

The diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI. However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation. EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging generative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the needs of embodied intelligence related research.

Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy-action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle action-related and distracting dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Workshop on World Models at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025, Poster, Project Page: https://laom.dunnolab.ai/, Source code: https://github.com/dunnolab/laom</p></details> |

Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[OctoNav: Towards Generalist Embodied Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09839v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents, which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1. Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1, we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e., Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically, we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability. Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Analytic Task Scheduler: Recursive Least Squares Based Method for Continual Learning in Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09623v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied foundation models are crucial for Artificial Intelligence (AI) interacting with the physical world by integrating multi-modal inputs, such as proprioception, vision and language, to understand human intentions and generate actions to control robots. While these models demonstrate strong generalization and few-shot learning capabilities, they face significant challenges in continually acquiring new skills without forgetting previously learned skills, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for continual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a task-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a single task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares (RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific models. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model selection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The scheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics (autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant learning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a real-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to forgetting and strong adaptability to task variations. The results highlight ATS as an effective, scalable, and deployable solution for continual learning in embodied foundation models operating in complex, dynamic environments. Our code will be available at https://github.com/MIAA-Embodied-AI/AnalyticTaskScheduler</p></details> |  |
| **[What Can RL Bring to VLA Generalization? An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://faceong.github.io/VIKI-R/</p></details> |

Understanding their kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$ larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos, outperforming existing methods significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website can be found at https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/video2articulation/</p></details> |

We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://metadriverse.github.io/dreamland/</p></details> |

Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

| **[LLM-driven Indoor Scene Layout Generation via Scaled Human-aligned Data Synthesis and Multi-Stage Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07570v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches such as Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes. Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such as drones and mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025 Embodied AI Workshop</p></details> |

Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate, and this trend is strongly evident in manipulation tasks. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots for manipulation tasks are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes \textsc{Corki}\xspace, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI-powered robotic manipulation applications. We aim to decouple LLM inference, robotic control, and data communication in the embodied AI robots' compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, \textsc{Corki}\xspace predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. \textsc{Corki}\xspace largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to $5.1\times$, resulting in up to $5.9\times$ speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 13.9\%.</p></details> |  |

Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence (maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21 held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed. Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors for scalable open-world visual understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05341v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://directlayout.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[OGGSplat: Open Gaussian Growing for Generalizable Reconstruction with Expanded Field-of-View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05204v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.</p></details> |  |

Both components employ modular 3D-printed finger designs, achieving ultra-low manufacturing costs while maintaining full actuation capabilities. Departing from conventional tendon-driven or underactuated approaches, our electromechanical system integrates independent joint motors across all 23 DoF, ensuring complete state observability and accurate kinematic modeling. This full-actuation architecture enables precise bidirectional kinematic calculations, substantially enhancing kinematic retargeting fidelity between the exoskeleton and robotic hand. The proposed system bridges the cost-performance gap in dexterous manipulation research, providing an accessible platform for acquiring high-quality demonstration data to advance embodied AI and dexterous robotic skill transfer learning.</p></details> |  |

We assess state-of-the-art OVSS models on the proposed benchmark and investigate the key factors that impact the performance of zero-shot transfer models.

We begin with a practical challenge: training a cross-morphology embodied AI policy that generalizes across diverse robot morphologies. We formalize this as the Heterogeneous Embodied Agent Training (HEAT) problem and prove it reduces to a structured Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that is PSPACE-complete. This result explains why current reinforcement learning pipelines break down under morphological diversity, due to sequential training constraints, memory-policy coupling, and data incompatibility. We further explore Collective Adaptation, a distributed learning alternative inspired by biological systems. Though NEXP-complete in theory, it offers meaningful scalability and deployment benefits in practice. This work illustrates how computational theory can illuminate system design trade-offs and guide the development of more robust, scalable embodied AI. For practitioners and researchers to explore this problem, the implementation code of this work has been made publicly available at https://github.com/airs-admin/HEAT</p></details> |  |

Traditional learning-based methods rely heavily on large-scale annotated data or require extensive interaction with the environment in a reinforcement learning setting, often failing to generalize to novel environments and limiting scalability. To overcome these challenges, we explore a zero-shot setting where the agent operates without task-specific training, enabling more scalable and adaptable solution. Recent advances in Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) offer powerful capabilities for visual understanding and reasoning, making them ideal for agents to comprehend scenes, identify relevant regions, and infer the likely locations of objects. In this work, we present a zero-shot object goal navigation framework that integrates the perceptual strength of VFMs with a model-based planner that is capable of long-horizon decision making through frontier exploration. We evaluate our approach on the HM3D dataset using the Habitat simulator and demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of success weighted by path length for zero-shot object goal navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 workshop - Foundation Models Meet Embodied Agents</p></details> |

Specifically, Map and Locate involves generating a point cloud from an unposed video and segmenting object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task serves as a critical step toward real-world embodied AI applications and introduces a practical task that bridges reconstruction, recognition and reorganization. To tackle this task, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline, which we denote as SAB3R. Our approach builds upon MASt3R, a recent breakthrough in 3D computer vision, and incorporates a lightweight distillation strategy. This method transfers dense, per-pixel semantic features from 2D vision backbones (eg, CLIP and DINOv2) to enhance MASt3R's capabilities. Without introducing any auxiliary frozen networks, our model generates per-pixel semantic features and constructs cohesive point maps in a single forward pass. Compared to separately deploying MASt3R and CLIP, our unified model, SAB3R, achieves superior performance on the Map and Locate benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate SAB3R on both 2D semantic segmentation and 3D tasks to comprehensively validate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>3D-LL...</summary><p>3D-LLM/VLA @ CVPR2025 | Project page: https://uva-computer-vision-lab.github.io/sab3r/</p></details> |

We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric video contexts. EgoVLM is fine-tuned via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method adapted to align model outputs with human-like reasoning steps. Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought (CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by 14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability, making it well-suited for downstream applications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel keyframe-based reward that incorporates salient frame selection to guide reinforcement learning optimization. This reward formulation opens a promising avenue for future exploration in temporally grounded egocentric reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our C...</summary><p>Our Code can be found at https://github.com/adityavavre/VidEgoVLM</p></details> |

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Online Tuning of VLM Agents via Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03792v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online fine-tuning vision-language model (VLM) agents with reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for equipping agents with multi-step, goal-oriented capabilities in dynamic environments. However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains.

Recent learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure. To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time. Rig raymaps allow the model to infer rig structure directly from input images when metadata is missing. Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.</p></details> |  |

While existing audio spatialization methods can generally map any available monaural audio to binaural audio signals, they often lack the flexible and interactive control needed in complex multi-object user-interactive environments. To address this, we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes flexible text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and comprehension perspectives. Due to the limited availability of premium and large-scale stereo data, we construct the SpatialTAS dataset, which encompasses 376,000 simulated binaural audio samples to facilitate the training of our model. Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and relative position prompts, augmented by flipped-channel audio. It outperforms existing methods on both simulated and real-recorded datasets, demonstrating superior generalization and accuracy. Besides, we develop an assessment model based on Llama-3.1-8B, which evaluates the spatial semantic coherence between our generated binaural audio and text prompts through a spatial reasoning task. Results demonstrate that text prompts provide flexible and interactive control to generate binaural audio with excellent quality and semantic consistency in spatial locations.

Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, i.e., pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the representation strategy. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multifaceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multimodal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions.

We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy. For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

While more robotics datasets are being created, the landscape of open data in the field is uneven. This is due to a lack of curation standards and consistent publication practices, which makes it difficult to discover, access, and reuse robotics data. To address these challenges, this paper presents a curation and access system with two main contributions: (1) a structured methodology to curate, publish, and integrate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) human-centered robotics datasets; and (2) a ChatGPT-powered conversational interface trained with the curated datasets metadata and documentation to enable exploration, comparison robotics datasets and data retrieval using natural language. Developed based on practical experience curating datasets from robotics labs within Texas Robotics at the University of Texas at Austin, the system demonstrates the value of standardized curation and persistent publication of robotics data. The system's evaluation suggests that access and understandability of human-robotics data are significantly improved.

Egocentric Spatial Reasoning in VLMs Across Disjoint Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24257v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An embodied AI assistant operating on egocentric video must integrate spatial cues across time - for instance, determining where an object A, glimpsed a few moments ago lies relative to an object B encountered later. We introduce Disjoint-3DQA , a generative QA benchmark that evaluates this ability of VLMs by posing questions about object pairs that are not co-visible in the same frame. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art VLMs and found that models lag behind human performance by 28%, with steeper declines in accuracy (60% to 30 %) as the temporal gap widens. Our analysis further reveals that providing trajectories or bird's-eye-view projections to VLMs results in only marginal improvements, whereas providing oracle 3D coordinates leads to a substantial 20% performance increase. This highlights a core bottleneck of multi-frame VLMs in constructing and maintaining 3D scene representations over time from visual signals. Disjoint-3DQA therefore sets a clear, measurable challenge for long-horizon spatial reasoning and aims to catalyze future research at the intersection of vision, language, and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing simulation frameworks typically support a narrow range of scenes/tasks and lack features critical for scaling generalizable robotics and sim2real. We introduce and open source ManiSkill3, the fastest state-visual GPU parallelized robotics simulator with contact-rich physics targeting generalizable manipulation. ManiSkill3 supports GPU parallelization of many aspects including simulation+rendering, heterogeneous simulation, pointclouds/voxels visual input, and more. Simulation with rendering on ManiSkill3 can run 10-1000x faster with 2-3x less GPU memory usage than other platforms, achieving up to 30,000+ FPS in benchmarked environments due to minimal python/pytorch overhead in the system, simulation on the GPU, and the use of the SAPIEN parallel rendering system.

Modeling hand-object interaction priors holds significant potential to advance robotic and embodied AI systems in learning to operate effectively within the physical world. We introduce SIGHT, a novel task focused on generating realistic and physically plausible 3D hand-object interaction trajectories from a single image and a brief language-based task description. Prior work on hand-object trajectory generation typically relies on textual input that lacks explicit grounding to the target object, or assumes access to 3D object meshes, which are often considerably more difficult to obtain than 2D images. We propose SIGHT-Fusion, a novel diffusion-based image-text conditioned generative model that tackles this task by retrieving the most similar 3D object mesh from a database and enforcing geometric hand-object interaction constraints via a novel inference-time diffusion guidance. We benchmark our model on the HOI4D and H2O datasets, adapting relevant baselines for this novel task. Experiments demonstrate our superior performance in the diversity and quality of generated trajectories, as well as in hand-object interaction geometry metrics.</p></details> |  |

This task is inherently challenging as it requires both accurate target recognition and effective trajectory planning under conditions of severe occlusion and high scene dynamics. Existing approaches typically address this challenge through a modular separation of recognition and planning. In this work, we propose TrackVLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that learns the synergy between object recognition and trajectory planning. Leveraging a shared LLM backbone, we employ a language modeling head for recognition and an anchor-based diffusion model for trajectory planning. To train TrackVLA, we construct an Embodied Visual Tracking Benchmark (EVT-Bench) and collect diverse difficulty levels of recognition samples, resulting in a dataset of 1.7 million samples. Through extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world environments, TrackVLA demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalizability. It significantly outperforms existing methods on public benchmarks in a zero-shot manner while remaining robust to high dynamics and occlusion in real-world scenarios at 10 FPS inference speed.

A Benchmark and Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19510v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for their expanding applications in embodied AI, robotics, and other real-world tasks. To effectively support these applications, grounding in spatial and temporal understanding in multimodal environments is essential. To this end, recent works have leveraged scene graphs, a structured representation that encodes entities, attributes, and their relationships in a scene. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs' ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that these models fail to effectively decompose discrete scenes from a complex narrative, leading to a bottleneck when generating scene graphs. These findings underscore the need for improved methodologies in scene graph generation and provide valuable insights for future research. The demonstration of our benchmark is available at https://tsg-bench.netlify.app. Additionally, our code and evaluation data are publicly available at https://github.com/docworlds/tsg-bench.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning.

Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |

By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interactions, robots can improve understanding, adapt to, and execute complex tasks in dynamic real-world environments. However, embodied AI in mobile service robots continues to face key challenges, including multimodal sensor fusion, real-time decision-making under uncertainty, task generalization, and effective human-robot interactions (HRI). In this paper, we present the first systematic review of the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics, identifying key open challenges in embodied AI and examining how foundation models can address them. Namely, we explore the role of such models in enabling real-time sensor fusion, language-conditioned control, and adaptive task execution. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications in the domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation sectors, demonstrating the transformative impact of foundation models on service robotics. We also include potential future research directions, emphasizing the need for predictive scaling laws, autonomous long-term adaptation, and cross-embodiment generalization to enable scalable, efficient, and robust deployment of foundation models in human-centric robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring 3D Activity Reasoning and Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D activity reasoning and planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advance in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Identity-Preserving Multi-Person Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18078v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable video generation (CVG) has advanced rapidly, yet current systems falter when more than one actor must move, interact, and exchange positions under noisy control signals. We address this gap with DanceTogether, the first end-to-end diffusion framework that turns a single reference image plus independent pose-mask streams into long, photorealistic videos while strictly preserving every identity. A novel MaskPoseAdapter binds "who" and "how" at every denoising step by fusing robust tracking masks with semantically rich-but noisy-pose heat-maps, eliminating the identity drift and appearance bleeding that plague frame-wise pipelines. To train and evaluate at scale, we introduce (i) PairFS-4K, 26 hours of dual-skater footage with 7,000+ distinct IDs, (ii) HumanRob-300, a one-hour humanoid-robot interaction set for rapid cross-domain transfer, and (iii) TogetherVideoBench, a three-track benchmark centered on the DanceTogEval-100 test suite covering dance, boxing, wrestling, yoga, and figure skating. On TogetherVideoBench, DanceTogether outperforms the prior arts by a significant margin. Moreover, we show that a one-hour fine-tune yields convincing human-robot videos, underscoring broad generalization to embodied-AI and HRI tasks. Extensive ablations confirm that persistent identity-action binding is critical to these gains. Together, our model, datasets, and benchmark lift CVG from single-subject choreography to compositionally controllable, multi-actor interaction, opening new avenues for digital production, simulation, and embodied intelligence.

Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust, long-term reasoning and planning.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Flow Policy Optimization (FPO), a simple on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that brings flow matching into the policy gradient framework. FPO casts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed from the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the popular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood computation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models. Unlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind training to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of diffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that FPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous control tasks. We find that flow-based models can capture multimodal action distributions and achieve higher performance than Gaussian policies, particularly in under-conditioned settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>See o...</summary><p>See our blog post: https://flowreinforce.github.io</p></details> |

However, the substantial computational costs associated with RL-based approaches have led to growing interest in alternative paradigms, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of DPO in facilitating self-improvement for LLMs through iterative preference-based learning. We demonstrate that a single round of DPO with coarse filtering significantly enhances mathematical reasoning performance, particularly for strong base model. Furthermore, we design an iterative enhancement framework for both the generator and the reward model (RM), enabling their mutual improvement through online interaction across multiple rounds of DPO. Finally, with simple verifiable rewards, our model DPO-VP achieves RL-level performance with significantly lower computational overhead. These findings highlight DPO as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to RL, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM reasoning in resource-constrained situations.</p></details> | 23pages |

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Current reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions. This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions. Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of 24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI interaction tasks.</p></details> |  |

Such updates are typically performed through handoff (HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA) observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF). Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a response time less than 0.4 ms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Communications (IEEE TCOM)</p></details> |

However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured, detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding, and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on H20 GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tencentarc.github.io/posts/arc-video-announcement/</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Leaning for Infinite-Dimensional Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15737v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interest in reinforcement learning (RL) for massive-scale systems consisting of large populations of intelligent agents interacting with heterogeneous environments has witnessed a significant surge in recent years across diverse scientific domains. However, the large-scale nature of these systems often results in high computational costs or compromised performance for most state-of-the-art RL techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL architecture along with the derivation of effective algorithms to learn optimal policies for arbitrarily large systems of agents. In our formulation, we model such a system as a parameterized control system defined on an infinite-dimensional function space. We then develop a moment kernel transform to map the parameterized system and the value function into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This transformation generates a sequence of finite-dimensional moment representations for the RL problem, which are organized into a filtrated structure. Leveraging this RL filtration, we develop a hierarchical algorithm for learning optimal policies for the infinite-dimensional parameterized system. We further enhance the efficiency of the algorithm by exploiting early stopping at each hierarchy, which demonstrates the fast convergence property of the algorithm through the construction of a convergent spectral sequence. The performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are validated using practical examples.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the probabilistic reward task from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study, we propose a novel framework that integrates the reinforcement learning (RL) model and drift-diffusion model (DDM) to jointly analyze reward-based decision-making with response times. To account for emerging evidence suggesting that decision-making may alternate between multiple interleaved strategies, we model latent state switching using a hidden Markov model (HMM). In the ''engaged'' state, decisions follow an RL-DDM, simultaneously capturing reward processing, decision dynamics, and temporal structure. In contrast, in the ''lapsed'' state, decision-making is modeled using a simplified DDM, where specific parameters are fixed to approximate random guessing with equal probability. The proposed method is implemented using a computationally efficient generalized expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with forward-backward procedures. Through extensive numerical studies, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms competing approaches across various reward-generating distributions, under both strategy-switching and non-switching scenarios, as well as in the presence of input perturbations. When applied to the EMBARC study, our framework reveals that MDD patients exhibit lower overall engagement than healthy controls and experience longer decision times when they do engage. Additionally, we show that neuroimaging measures of brain activities are associated with decision-making characteristics in the ''engaged'' state but not in the ''lapsed'' state, providing evidence of brain-behavior association specific to the ''engaged'' state.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making. DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models, such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances in practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and action spaces. We propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous state and action spaces by employing a geometric lens to understand the locally attained set of states. The set of all parametrised policies learnt through a semi-gradient based approach induces a set of attainable states in RL. We show that the training dynamics of a two-layer neural policy induce a low dimensional manifold of attainable states embedded in the high-dimensional nominal state space trained using an actor-critic algorithm. We prove that, under certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is of the order of the dimensionality of the action space. This is the first result of its kind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the action space. We empirically corroborate this upper bound for four MuJoCo environments and also demonstrate the results in a toy environment with varying dimensionality. We also show the applicability of this theoretical result by introducing a local manifold learning layer to the policy and value function networks to improve the performance in control environments with very high degrees of freedom by changing one layer of the neural network to learn sparse representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2301.00009</p></details> |

| **[Learning Only with Images: Visual Reinforcement Learning with Reasoning, Rendering, and Visual Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20766v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision. Code will be available at https://github.com/L-O-I/RRVF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Prompt Difficulty be Online Predicted for Accelerating RL Finetuning of Reasoning Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04632v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3 models.</p></details> |  |

However, many model-free RL algorithms experience performance degradation due to inaccurate value estimation, particularly the overestimation of Q-values, which can lead to suboptimal policies. To address this issue, we previously proposed the Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC or DSACv1), an off-policy RL algorithm that enhances value estimation accuracy by learning a continuous Gaussian value distribution. Despite its effectiveness, DSACv1 faces challenges such as training instability and sensitivity to reward scaling, caused by high variance in critic gradients due to return randomness. In this paper, we introduce three key refinements to DSACv1 to overcome these limitations and further improve Q-value estimation accuracy: expected value substitution, twin value distribution learning, and variance-based critic gradient adjustment. The enhanced algorithm, termed DSAC with Three refinements (DSAC-T or DSACv2), is systematically evaluated across a diverse set of benchmark tasks. Without the need for task-specific hyperparameter tuning, DSAC-T consistently matches or outperforms leading model-free RL algorithms, including SAC, TD3, DDPG, TRPO, and PPO, in all tested environments. Additionally, DSAC-T ensures a stable learning process and maintains robust performance across varying reward scales. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated through real-world application in controlling a wheeled robot, highlighting its potential for deployment in practical robotic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title updated in this version.

While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization that employs a novel contrastive RL algorithm. CUDA-L1 achieves significant performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x3.12 with a median speedup of x1.42 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x120. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x3.12 on L40, x2.50 on RTX 3090, x2.39 on H100, and x2.37 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100. The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that, RL can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources. We also identify important challenges posed by training RL models for tasks like CUDA development, where RL often learns to exploit loopholes in reward functions rather than solve the intended optimization problems. By identifying these failure modes and analyzing their root causes, we develop practical methods for creating more robust training procedures that prevent reward hacking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://deepreinforce-ai.github.io/cudal1_blog/</p></details> |

We describe the methodology for mapping the iterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose different methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of the reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

It is developed by our proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive, safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety `aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of $46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism, enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B.

However, several critical challenges persist, including the dynamic optimization of network resources and UAV trajectories, limited UAV endurance, and imperfect channel state information (CSI). In this paper, we offer new insights into low-altitude economy networking by exploring intelligent UAV-assisted vehicle-to-everything communication strategies aligned with UAV energy efficiency. Particularly, we formulate an optimization problem of joint channel allocation, power control, and flight altitude adjustment in UAV-assisted vehicular networks. Taking CSI feedback delay into account, our objective is to maximize the vehicle-to-UAV communication sum rate while satisfying the UAV's long-term energy constraint. To this end, we first leverage Lyapunov optimization to decompose the original long-term problem into a series of per-slot deterministic subproblems. We then propose a diffusion-based deep deterministic policy gradient (D3PG) algorithm, which innovatively integrates diffusion models to determine optimal channel allocation, power control, and flight altitude adjustment decisions. Through extensive simulations using real-world vehicle mobility traces, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed D3PG algorithm compared to existing benchmark solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures, transactions paper</p></details> |

| **[Eyes Will Shut: A Vision-Based Next GPS Location Prediction Model by Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feed Back](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18661v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However, the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor, which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive learning-based agent modeling for deep reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00132v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems often require agents to collaborate with or compete against other agents with diverse goals, behaviors, or strategies. Agent modeling is essential when designing adaptive policies for intelligent machine agents in multiagent systems, as this is the means by which the ego agent understands other agents' behavior and extracts their meaningful policy representations. These representations can be used to enhance the ego agent's adaptive policy which is trained by reinforcement learning. However, existing agent modeling approaches typically assume the availability of local observations from other agents (modeled agents) during training or a long observation trajectory for policy adaption. To remove these constrictive assumptions and improve agent modeling performance, we devised a Contrastive Learning-based Agent Modeling (CLAM) method that relies only on the local observations from the ego agent during training and execution. With these observations, CLAM is capable of generating consistent high-quality policy representations in real-time right from the beginning of each episode. We evaluated the efficacy of our approach in both cooperative and competitive multi-agent environments. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art on both cooperative and competitive tasks, highlighting the potential of contrastive learning-based agent modeling for enhancing reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[REINFORCE++: An Efficient RLHF Algorithm with Robustness to Both Prompt and Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03262v7)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences. While state-of-the-art applications like ChatGPT or GPT-4 commonly employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the inclusion of a critic network introduces significant computational overhead. REINFORCE-based methods, such as REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), address this limitation by eliminating the critic network. However, these approaches face challenges in accurate advantage estimation. Specifically, they estimate advantages independently for responses to each prompt, which can lead to overfitting on simpler prompts and vulnerability to reward hacking and may be biased. To address these challenges, we introduce REINFORCE++, a novel approach that removes the critic model while using the global advantage normalization which is unbiased to improve the training stability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that REINFORCE++ exhibits robust performance across various reward models without requiring prompt set truncation. Furthermore, it achieves superior generalization in both RLHF and long chain-of-thought (CoT) settings compared to existing REINFORCE-based methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF.</p></details> | add experiments |

A key challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance, which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments, we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

However, retrieval noises significantly impact the quality of LLMs' generation, necessitating the development of denoising mechanisms. Previous methods extract evidence straightforwardly without explicit thinking, which risks filtering out key clues and struggles with generalization. To this end, we propose LEAR, which learns to extract rational evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to identify potential cues within retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting any key cues helpful for answering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of LEAR, providing compact and high-quality evidence, improving the accuracy of downstream tasks, and promoting effective application in online RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 Figures, 10 Tables</p></details> |

Each token is then mapped to an embedding, enabling parallel attention computations while preserving the input's essential information. Due to the quadratic computational complexity of transformer self-attention mechanisms, token reduction has primarily been used as an efficiency strategy. This is especially true in single vision and language domains, where it helps balance computational costs, memory usage, and inference latency. Despite these advances, this paper argues that token reduction should transcend its traditional efficiency-oriented role in the era of large generative models. Instead, we position it as a fundamental principle in generative modeling, critically influencing both model architecture and broader applications. Specifically, we contend that across vision, language, and multimodal systems, token reduction can: (i) facilitate deeper multimodal integration and alignment, (ii) mitigate "overthinking" and hallucinations, (iii) maintain coherence over long inputs, and (iv) enhance training stability, etc. We reframe token reduction as more than an efficiency measure. By doing so, we outline promising future directions, including algorithm design, reinforcement learning-guided token reduction, token optimization for in-context learning, and broader ML and scientific domains. We highlight its potential to drive new model architectures and learning strategies that improve robustness, increase interpretability, and better align with the objectives of generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/ZLKong/Awesome-Collection-Token-Reduction</p></details> |

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple, yet effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Synthetic preference data with its low cost and high quality enable effective alignment through single- or multi-model generated preference data. Our study reveals a striking, safety-specific phenomenon associated with DPO alignment: Although multi-model generated data enhances performance on general tasks (ARC, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, Winogrande) by providing diverse responses, it also tends to facilitate reward hacking during training. This can lead to a high attack success rate (ASR) when models encounter jailbreaking prompts. The issue is particularly pronounced when employing stronger models like GPT-4o or larger models in the same family to generate chosen responses paired with target model self-generated rejected responses, resulting in dramatically poorer safety outcomes. Furthermore, with respect to safety, using solely self-generated responses (single-model generation) for both chosen and rejected pairs significantly outperforms configurations that incorporate responses from stronger models, whether used directly as chosen data or as part of a multi-model response pool. We demonstrate that multi-model preference data exhibits high linear separability between chosen and rejected responses, which allows models to exploit superficial cues rather than internalizing robust safety constraints. Our experiments, conducted on models from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families, consistently validate these findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version includes updated results and expanded discussion</p></details> |

External memory mechanisms have been proposed to address this limitation, enabling LLMs to maintain conversational continuity. However, existing approaches struggle with two key challenges. First, rigid memory granularity fails to capture the natural semantic structure of conversations, leading to fragmented and incomplete representations. Second, fixed retrieval mechanisms cannot adapt to diverse dialogue contexts and user interaction patterns. In this work, we propose Reflective Memory Management (RMM), a novel mechanism for long-term dialogue agents, integrating forward- and backward-looking reflections: (1) Prospective Reflection, which dynamically summarizes interactions across granularities-utterances, turns, and sessions-into a personalized memory bank for effective future retrieval, and (2) Retrospective Reflection, which iteratively refines the retrieval in an online reinforcement learning (RL) manner based on LLMs' cited evidence. Experiments show that RMM demonstrates consistent improvement across various metrics and benchmarks. For example, RMM shows more than 10% accuracy improvement over the baseline without memory management on the LongMemEval dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |

To mitigate this issue, we introduce bipedalism for quadrupedal robots, thus freeing the front legs for versatile interactions with the environment. We propose a risk-adaptive distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework designed for quadrupedal robots walking on their hind legs, balancing worst-case conservativeness with optimal performance in this inherently unstable task. During training, the adaptive risk preference is dynamically adjusted based on the uncertainty of the return, measured by the coefficient of variation of the estimated return distribution. Extensive experiments in simulation show our method's superior performance over baselines. Real-world deployment on a Unitree Go2 robot further demonstrates the versatility of our policy, enabling tasks like cart pushing, obstacle probing, and payload transport, while showcasing robustness against challenging dynamics and external disturbances.</p></details> | Humanoids 2025 |

We propose in this work a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning named Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS) for dynamic mobility resource allocation. HAG-PS aims to address two important research challenges regarding multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility resource allocation: (1) how to dynamically and adaptively share the mobility resource allocation policy (i.e., how to distribute mobility resources) across agents (i.e., representing the regional coordinators of mobility resources); and (2) how to achieve memory-efficient parameter sharing in an urban-scale setting. To address the above challenges, we have provided following novel designs within HAG-PS. To enable dynamic and adaptive parameter sharing, we have designed a hierarchical approach that consists of global and local information of the mobility resource states (e.g., distribution of mobility resources). We have developed an adaptive agent grouping approach in order to split or merge the groups of agents based on their relative closeness of encoded trajectories (i.e., states, actions, and rewards). We have designed a learnable identity (ID) embeddings to enable agent specialization beyond simple parameter copy. We have performed extensive experimental studies based on real-world NYC bike sharing data (a total of more than 1.2 million trips), and demonstrated the superior performance (e.g., improved bike availability) of HAG-PS compared with other baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, UrbComp 2025</p></details> |

Conventional flat network architectures struggle with synchronization and data transmission across massive distributed nodes. In response, hierarchical domain-based satellite network architectures have emerged as a scalable solution, highlighting the critical importance of controller provisioning strategies. However, existing network management architectures and traditional search-based algorithms fail to generate efficient controller provisioning solutions due to limited computational resources in satellites and strict time constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a three-layer domain-based architecture that enhances both scalability and adaptability. Furthermore, we introduce Dora, a reinforcement learning-based controller provisioning strategy designed to optimize network performance while minimizing computational overhead. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that Dora significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving 10% improvement in controller provisioning quality while requiring only 1/30 to 1/90 of the computation time compared to traditional algorithms. These results underscore the potential of reinforcement learning approaches for efficient satellite network management in next-generation SAGIN deployments.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose EduAlign, a novel framework designed to guide LLMs toward becoming more effective and responsible educational assistants. EduAlign consists of two main stages. In the first stage, we curate a dataset of 8k educational interactions and annotate them-both manually and automatically-along three key educational dimensions: Helpfulness, Personalization, and Creativity (HPC). These annotations are used to train HPC-RM, a multi-dimensional reward model capable of accurately scoring LLM outputs according to these educational principles. We further evaluate the consistency and reliability of this reward model. In the second stage, we leverage HPC-RM as a reward signal to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on a set of 2k diverse prompts. We then assess the pre- and post-finetuning models on both educational and general-domain benchmarks across the three HPC dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits significantly improved alignment with pedagogical helpfulness, personalization, and creativity stimulation. This study presents a scalable and effective approach to aligning LLMs with nuanced and desirable educational traits, paving the way for the development of more engaging, pedagogically aligned AI tutors.</p></details> |  |

As a starting point, we use our framework to reproduce the symmetry-based representations from the symmetry-based disentangled representation learning (SBDRL) formalism proposed by [1]; only the algebra of transformations of worlds that form groups can be described using symmetry-based representations. We then study the algebras of the transformations of worlds with features that occur in simple reinforcement learning scenarios. Using computational methods, that we developed, we extract the algebras of the transformations of these worlds and classify them according to their properties. Finally, we generalise two important results of SBDRL - the equivariance condition and the disentangling definition - from only working with symmetry-based representations to working with representations capturing the transformation properties of worlds with transformations for any algebra. Finally, we combine our generalised equivariance condition and our generalised disentangling definition to show that disentangled sub-algebras can each have their own individual equivariance conditions, which can be treated independently.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparative Study of OpenMP Scheduling Algorithm Selection Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20312v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific and data science applications are becoming increasingly complex, with growing computational and memory demands. Modern high performance computing (HPC) systems provide high parallelism and heterogeneity across nodes, devices, and cores. To achieve good performance, effective scheduling and load balancing techniques are essential. Parallel programming frameworks such as OpenMP now offer a variety of advanced scheduling algorithms to support diverse applications and platforms. This creates an instance of the scheduling algorithm selection problem, which involves identifying the most suitable algorithm for a given combination of workload and system characteristics. In this work, we explore learning-based approaches for selecting scheduling algorithms in OpenMP. We propose and evaluate expert-based and reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods, and conduct a detailed performance analysis across six applications and three systems. Our results show that RL methods are capable of learning high-performing scheduling decisions, although they require significant exploration, with the choice of reward function playing a key role. Expert-based methods, in contrast, rely on prior knowledge and involve less exploration, though they may not always identify the optimal algorithm for a specific application-system pair. By combining expert knowledge with RL-based learning, we achieve improved performance and greater adaptability. Overall, this work demonstrates that dynamic selection of scheduling algorithms during execution is both viable and beneficial for OpenMP applications. The approach can also be extended to MPI-based programs, enabling optimization of scheduling decisions across multiple levels of parallelism.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at IEEE ACCESS</p></details> |
| **[Learning from Expert Factors: Trajectory-level Reward Shaping for Formulaic Alpha Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20263v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has successfully automated the complex process of mining formulaic alpha factors, for creating interpretable and profitable investment strategies. However, existing methods are hampered by the sparse rewards given the underlying Markov Decision Process. This inefficiency limits the exploration of the vast symbolic search space and destabilizes the training process. To address this, Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), a novel reward shaping method, is proposed. TLRS provides dense, intermediate rewards by measuring the subsequence-level similarity between partially generated expressions and a set of expert-designed formulas. Furthermore, a reward centering mechanism is introduced to reduce training variance. Extensive experiments on six major Chinese and U.S. stock indices show that TLRS significantly improves the predictive power of mined factors, boosting the Rank Information Coefficient by 9.29% over existing potential-based shaping algorithms. Notably, TLRS achieves a major leap in computational efficiency by reducing its time complexity with respect to the feature dimension from linear to constant, which is a significant improvement over distance-based baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Analytic Gradients in Provably Safe Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01665v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of autonomous robots in safety-critical applications requires safety guarantees. Provably safe reinforcement learning is an active field of research that aims to provide such guarantees using safeguards. These safeguards should be integrated during training to reduce the sim-to-real gap. While there are several approaches for safeguarding sampling-based reinforcement learning, analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning often achieves superior performance from fewer environment interactions. However, there is no safeguarding approach for this learning paradigm yet. Our work addresses this gap by developing the first effective safeguard for analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning. We analyse existing, differentiable safeguards, adapt them through modified mappings and gradient formulations, and integrate them with a state-of-the-art learning algorithm and a differentiable simulation. Using numerical experiments on three control tasks, we evaluate how different safeguards affect learning. The results demonstrate safeguarded training without compromising performance.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Post-Completion Learning for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20252v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current language model training paradigms typically terminate learning upon reaching the end-of-sequence (<eos>}) token, overlooking the potential learning opportunities in the post-completion space. We propose Post-Completion Learning (PCL), a novel training framework that systematically utilizes the sequence space after model output completion, to enhance both the reasoning and self-evaluation abilities. PCL enables models to continue generating self-assessments and reward predictions during training, while maintaining efficient inference by stopping at the completion point. To fully utilize this post-completion space, we design a white-box reinforcement learning method: let the model evaluate the output content according to the reward rules, then calculate and align the score with the reward functions for supervision. We implement dual-track SFT to optimize both reasoning and evaluation capabilities, and mixed it with RL training to achieve multi-objective hybrid optimization. Experimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional SFT and RL methods. Our method provides a new technical path for language model training that enhances output quality while preserving deployment efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Using a reinforcement learning pipeline that incorporates tool-based interactions, StepFun-Prover can achieve strong performance in generating Lean 4 proofs with minimal sampling. Our approach enables the model to emulate human-like problem-solving strategies by iteratively refining proofs based on real-time environment feedback. On the miniF2F-test benchmark, StepFun-Prover achieves a pass@1 success rate of $70.0\%$. Beyond advancing benchmark performance, we introduce an end-to-end training framework for developing tool-integrated reasoning models, offering a promising direction for automated theorem proving and Math AI assistant.</p></details> | 25 pages, 4 figures |

However, their effectiveness on subjective questions that may have different responses from different perspectives is still limited by a tendency towards homogeneous reasoning, introduced by the reliance on a single ground truth in supervised fine-tuning and verifiable reward in reinforcement learning. Motivated by the finding that increasing role perspectives consistently improves performance, we propose MultiRole-R1, a diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives, to improve the accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks. MultiRole-R1 features an unsupervised data construction pipeline that generates reasoning chains that incorporate diverse role perspectives. We further employ reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward shaping, by taking diversity as a reward signal in addition to the verifiable reward. With specially designed reward functions, we successfully promote perspective diversity and lexical diversity, uncovering a positive relation between reasoning diversity and accuracy. Our experiment on six benchmarks demonstrates MultiRole-R1's effectiveness and generalizability in enhancing both subjective and objective reasoning, showcasing the potential of diversity-enhanced training in LRMs.</p></details> |  |

However, given the inherent complexity of speech signals, these models inevitably suffer from performance degradation in specific target domains. To address this, we focus on enhancing audio LLMs in target domains without any labeled data. We propose a self-improvement method called SI-SDA, leveraging the information embedded in large-model decoding to evaluate the quality of generated pseudo labels and then perform domain adaptation based on reinforcement learning optimization. Experimental results show that our method consistently and significantly improves audio LLM performance, outperforming existing baselines in WER and BLEU across multiple public datasets of automatic speech recognition (ASR), spoken question-answering (SQA), and speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Furthermore, our approach exhibits high data efficiency, underscoring its potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Interspeech 2025. 6 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[The Policy Cliff: A Theoretical Analysis of Reward-Policy Maps in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20150v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics. This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how stability is governed by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. We also prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept Learning for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20143v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite substantial progress in applying neural networks (NN) to multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) areas, they still largely suffer from a lack of transparency and interoperability. However, its implicit cooperative mechanism is not yet fully understood due to black-box networks. In this work, we study an interpretable value decomposition framework via concept bottleneck models, which promote trustworthiness by conditioning credit assignment on an intermediate level of human-like cooperation concepts. To address this problem, we propose a novel value-based method, named Concepts learning for Multi-agent Q-learning (CMQ), that goes beyond the current performance-vs-interpretability trade-off by learning interpretable cooperation concepts. CMQ represents each cooperation concept as a supervised vector, as opposed to existing models where the information flowing through their end-to-end mechanism is concept-agnostic. Intuitively, using individual action value conditioning on global state embeddings to represent each concept allows for extra cooperation representation capacity. Empirical evaluations on the StarCraft II micromanagement challenge and level-based foraging (LBF) show that CMQ achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. The results also demonstrate that CMQ provides more cooperation concept representation capturing meaningful cooperation modes, and supports test-time concept interventions for detecting potential biases of cooperation mode and identifying spurious artifacts that impact cooperation.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE-...</summary><p>IEEE-China Conference on System Simulation Technology and its Applications, 2025</p></details> |

Unlike existing minimax optimal approaches, EQO avoids reliance on empirical variances and employs a simple bonus term proportional to the inverse of the state-action visit count. Central to EQO is the concept of quasi-optimism, where estimated values need not be fully optimistic, allowing for a simpler yet effective exploration strategy. The algorithm achieves the sharpest known regret bound for tabular RL under the mildest assumptions, proving that fast convergence can be attained with a practical and computationally efficient approach. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that EQO consistently outperforms existing algorithms in both regret performance and computational efficiency, providing the best of both theoretical soundness and practical effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor corrections to constant factors</p></details> |

We compare supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models. Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[PERRY: Policy Evaluation with Confidence Intervals using Auxiliary Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20068v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods aim to estimate the value of a new reinforcement learning (RL) policy prior to deployment. Recent advances have shown that leveraging auxiliary datasets, such as those synthesized by generative models, can improve the accuracy of these value estimates. Unfortunately, such auxiliary datasets may also be biased, and existing methods for using data augmentation for OPE in RL lack principled uncertainty quantification. In high stakes settings like healthcare, reliable uncertainty estimates are important for comparing policy value estimates. In this work, we propose two approaches to construct valid confidence intervals for OPE when using data augmentation. The first provides a confidence interval over the policy performance conditioned on a particular initial state $V^{\pi}(s_0)$-- such intervals are particularly important for human-centered applications. To do so we introduce a new conformal prediction method for high dimensional state MDPs. Second, we consider the more common task of estimating the average policy performance over many initial states; to do so we draw on ideas from doubly robust estimation and prediction powered inference. Across simulators spanning robotics, healthcare and inventory management, and a real healthcare dataset from MIMIC-IV, we find that our methods can use augmented data and still consistently produce intervals that cover the ground truth values, unlike previously proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Mean Field Framework for Aggregators Participating in Wholesale Electricity Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03240v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DERs), including rooftop solar and energy storage, is transforming the grid edge, where distributed technologies and customer-side systems increasingly interact with the broader power grid. DER aggregators, entities that coordinate and optimize the actions of many small-scale DERs, play a key role in this transformation. This paper presents a hybrid Mean-Field Control (MFC) and Mean-Field Game (MFG) framework for integrating DER aggregators into wholesale electricity markets. Unlike traditional approaches that treat market prices as exogenous, our model captures the feedback between aggregators' strategies and locational marginal prices (LMPs) of electricity. The MFC component optimizes DER operations within each aggregator, while the MFG models strategic interactions among multiple aggregators. To account for various uncertainties, we incorporate reinforcement learning (RL), which allows aggregators to learn optimal bidding strategies in dynamic market conditions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a mean-field equilibrium and validate the framework through a case study of the Oahu Island power system. Results show that our approach reduces price volatility and improves market efficiency, offering a scalable and decentralized solution for DER integration in wholesale markets.</p></details> |  |

While feature-learning dynamics of nonstationary learning problems are not well studied, the emergence of feature-learning dynamics is known to drive the phenomenon of grokking, wherein neural networks initially memorize their training data and only later exhibit perfect generalization. This work conjectures that the same feature-learning dynamics which facilitate generalization in grokking also underlie the ability to overwrite previous learned features as well, and methods which accelerate grokking by facilitating feature-learning dynamics are promising candidates for addressing primacy bias in non-stationary learning problems. We then propose a straightforward method to induce feature-learning dynamics as needed throughout training by increasing the effective learning rate, i.e. the ratio between parameter and update norms. We show that this approach both facilitates feature-learning and improves generalization in a variety of settings, including grokking, warm-starting neural network training, and reinforcement learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

PDD is an iterative, five-step process that consists of: i) deriving device behavior from design parameters, ii) simulating device performance, iii) finding the optimal candidate designs from simulations, iv) fabricating the optimal device, and v) measuring device performance. Classically, all these steps involve Bayesian optimization, material science, control theory, and direct physics-driven numerical methods. However, many of these techniques are computationally intractable, monetarily costly, or difficult to implement at scale. In addition, PDD suffers from large optimization landscapes, uncertainties in structural or optical characterization, and difficulties in implementing robust fabrication processes. However, the advent of machine learning over the past decade has provided novel, data-driven strategies for tackling these challenges, including surrogate estimators for speeding up computations, generative modeling for noisy measurement modeling and data augmentation, reinforcement learning for fabrication, and active learning for experimental physical discovery. In this review, we present a comprehensive perspective on these methods to enable machine-learning-assisted PDD (ML-PDD) for efficient design optimization with powerful generative models, fast simulation and characterization modeling under noisy measurements, and reinforcement learning for fabrication. This review will provide researchers from diverse backgrounds with valuable insights into this emerging topic, fostering interdisciplinary efforts to accelerate the development of complex photonic devices and systems.</p></details> |  |

Autonomous driving technologies have emerged as a potential solution. Among traffic control methods, reinforcement learning has shown superior performance over traffic signals in various scenarios. However, prior research has largely focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections, leaving large-scale mixed traffic control largely unexplored. This study presents the first attempt to use decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning for large-scale mixed traffic control in which some intersections are managed by traffic signals and others by robot vehicles. Evaluating a real-world network in Colorado Springs, CO, USA with 14 intersections, we measure traffic efficiency via average waiting time of vehicles at intersections and the number of vehicles reaching their destinations within a time window (i.e., throughput). At 80% RV penetration rate, our method reduces waiting time from 6.17s to 5.09s and increases throughput from 454 vehicles per 500 seconds to 493 vehicles per 500 seconds, outperforming the baseline of fully signalized intersections. These findings suggest that integrating reinforcement learning-based control large-scale traffic can improve overall efficiency and may inform future urban planning strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preconditioned Inexact Stochastic ADMM for Deep Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10784v3)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancement of foundation models (FMs) has brought about a paradigm shift, revolutionizing various sectors worldwide. The popular optimizers used to train these models are stochastic gradient descent-based algorithms, which face inherent limitations, such as slow convergence and stringent assumptions for convergence. In particular, data heterogeneity arising from distributed settings poses significant challenges to their theoretical and numerical performance. This paper develops an algorithm, PISA (\textbf{P}reconditioned \textbf{I}nexact \textbf{S}tochastic \textbf{A}lternating Direction Method of Multipliers), which enables scalable parallel computing and supports various preconditions, such as second-order information, second moment, and orthogonalized momentum by Newton-Schulz iterations. Grounded in rigorous theoretical guarantees, the algorithm converges under the sole assumption of Lipschitz continuity of the gradient on a bounded region, thereby removing the need for other conditions commonly imposed by stochastic methods. This capability enables PISA to tackle the challenge of data heterogeneity effectively. Comprehensive experimental evaluations for training or fine-tuning diverse deep models, including vision models, large language models, reinforcement learning models, generative adversarial networks, and recurrent neural networks, demonstrate its superior numerical performance compared to various state-of-the-art optimizers.</p></details> |  |

Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) is known for ensuring monotonic policy improvement through conservative updates within a trust region, backed by strong theoretical guarantees. However, its reliance on complex second-order optimization limits its practical efficiency. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) addresses this by simplifying TRPO's approach using ratio clipping, improving efficiency but sacrificing some theoretical robustness. This raises a natural question: Can we combine the strengths of both methods? In this paper, we introduce Simple Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel unconstrained first-order algorithm. By slightly modifying the policy loss used in PPO, SPO can achieve the best of both worlds. Our new objective improves upon ratio clipping, offering stronger theoretical properties and better constraining the probability ratio within the trust region. Empirical results demonstrate that SPO outperforms PPO with a simple implementation, particularly for training large, complex network architectures end-to-end.</p></details> |  |

A critical challenge is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced. Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based verifiers. However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM judges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers' performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is equipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a multidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs. complete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show stronger inclusivity but unstable precision. More importantly, we discover verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks of current verifier technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising direction, state-of-the-art methods suffer from a critical limitation: to manage the search space, they rely on rigid ``hard constraints'' that prematurely prune the search space and often preclude optimal solutions. To address this, we introduce SoftPipe, a novel RL framework that replaces these constraints with a flexible ``soft guidance'' paradigm. SoftPipe formulates action selection as a Bayesian inference problem. A high-level strategic prior, generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), probabilistically guides exploration. This prior is combined with empirical estimators from two sources through a collaborative process: a fine-grained quality score from a supervised Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model and a long-term value estimate from the agent's Q-function. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse datasets, we demonstrate that SoftPipe achieves up to a 13.9\% improvement in pipeline quality and 2.8$\times$ faster convergence compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this, researchers have begun adapting machine unlearning techniques from traditional classification models to generative settings. Although notable progress has been made in this area, a unified framework for systematically organizing and integrating existing work is still lacking. The substantial differences among current studies in terms of unlearning objectives and evaluation protocols hinder the objective and fair comparison of various approaches. While some studies focus on specific types of generative models, they often overlook the commonalities and systematic characteristics inherent in Generative Model Unlearning (GenMU). To bridge this gap, we provide a comprehensive review of current research on GenMU and propose a unified analytical framework for categorizing unlearning objectives, methodological strategies, and evaluation metrics. In addition, we explore the connections between GenMU and related techniques, including model editing, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and controllable generation. We further highlight the potential practical value of unlearning techniques in real-world applications. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future research directions aimed at laying a solid foundation for further advancements in this field.

We introduce a subsurface assignment variable that determines the number of STAR-RIS elements allocated to each user and maximizes the sum of the data rates by jointly optimizing the phase shifts of the STAR-RIS and the subsurface assignment variables using an appropriately tailored deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. The proposed DRL method is also compared with a Dinkelbach algorithm and the designed hybrid DRL approach. A penalty term is incorporated into the DRL model to enhance resource utilization by intelligently deactivating STAR-RIS elements when not required. The proposed DRL method can achieve fair and high data rates for static and mobile users while ensuring efficient resource utilization through extensive simulations. Using the proposed DRL method, up to 27% and 21% of STAR-RIS elements can be deactivated in static and mobile scenarios, respectively, without affecting performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think, Act, Learn: A Framework for Autonomous Robotic Agents using Closed-Loop Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19854v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked unprecedented capabilities in high-level task planning. However, most current systems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners, rendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in dynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the "Think, Act, Learn" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that enables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through continuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an LLM first "thinks" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans. The robot then "acts" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal sensory feedback. Critically, the "learn" module processes this feedback to facilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal analysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are stored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We demonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world that our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including open-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning. Our framework achieves over a 97% success rate on complex, long-horizon tasks, converges to a stable policy in an average of just 9 trials, and exhibits remarkable generalization to unseen tasks. This work presents a significant step towards developing more robust, adaptive, and truly autonomous robotic agents.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19849v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models' intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/dongguanting/ARPO</p></details> | Working on progress |

The proposed LEM scheme utilizes a data-driven, model-free reinforcement learning approach based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enabling prosumers to make real-time decisions on whether to buy, sell, or refrain from any action while facilitating efficient coordination for optimal energy trading in a dynamic market. In addition, we investigate a price manipulation strategy using a variational auto encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN) model, which allows utilities to adjust price signals in a way that induces financial losses for the prosumers. Our results show that under adversarial pricing, heterogeneous prosumer groups, particularly those lacking generation capabilities, incur financial losses. The same outcome holds across LEMs of different sizes. As the market size increases, trading stabilizes and fairness improves through emergent cooperation among agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)</p></details> |

In this work, we first establish that guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus, and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL, enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information retrieval systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Reasoning to Super-Intelligence: A Search-Theoretic Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15865v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the theoretical foundations of learning from CoT data remain underdeveloped, and existing approaches -- such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) -- often fail on complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we identify core obstacles that hinder effective CoT learning, including distribution drift, lack of embedded search, and exponential inference costs. We introduce the Diligent Learner, a new learning paradigm that explicitly models reasoning as a depth-first search guided by a validator and supports backtracking upon failure. Under two mild and realistic assumptions, we prove that the Diligent Learner can efficiently learn from CoT data while existing methods fail to do so. This framework offers a path toward building scalable and reliable reasoning systems trained on naturally occurring, incomplete data -- paving the way for the development of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with robust, interpretable problem-solving abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-End Fine-Tuning of 3D Texture Generation using Differentiable Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18331v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent 3D generative models can produce high-quality texture images, they often fail to capture human preferences or meet task-specific requirements. Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D texture generation domain is that most existing approaches rely on repeated calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To alleviate these issues, we propose an end-to-end differentiable, reinforcement-learning-free framework that embeds human feedback, expressed as differentiable reward functions, directly into the 3D texture synthesis pipeline. By back-propagating preference signals through both geometric and appearance modules of the proposed framework, our method generates textures that respect the 3D geometry structure and align with desired criteria. To demonstrate its versatility, we introduce three novel geometry-aware reward functions, which offer a more controllable and interpretable pathway for creating high-quality 3D content from natural language. By conducting qualitative, quantitative, and user-preference evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate that our proposed strategy consistently outperforms existing approaches. We will make our implementation code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Overcoming Slow Decision Frequencies in Continuous Control: Model-Based Sequence Reinforcement Learning for Model-Free Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08979v5)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is rapidly reaching and surpassing human-level control capabilities. However, state-of-the-art RL algorithms often require timesteps and reaction times significantly faster than human capabilities, which is impractical in real-world settings and typically necessitates specialized hardware. We introduce Sequence Reinforcement Learning (SRL), an RL algorithm designed to produce a sequence of actions for a given input state, enabling effective control at lower decision frequencies. SRL addresses the challenges of learning action sequences by employing both a model and an actor-critic architecture operating at different temporal scales. We propose a "temporal recall" mechanism, where the critic uses the model to estimate intermediate states between primitive actions, providing a learning signal for each individual action within the sequence. Once training is complete, the actor can generate action sequences independently of the model, achieving model-free control at a slower frequency. We evaluate SRL on a suite of continuous control tasks, demonstrating that it achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms while significantly reducing actor sample complexity. To better assess performance across varying decision frequencies, we introduce the Frequency-Averaged Score (FAS) metric. Our results show that SRL significantly outperforms traditional RL algorithms in terms of FAS, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring variable decision frequencies. Furthermore, we compare SRL with model-based online planning, showing that SRL achieves comparable FAS while leveraging the same model during training that online planners use for planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 14 figures, 7 tables.

The model is evaluated using a multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) method, benchmarked against an originally single-objective RL algorithm modified with weighted sum using predefined weights, and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA)-based approach. We conduct experiments on varying network complexities, mimicking typical real-world challenges using a customisable simulator. The model determines production and delivery quantities across supply chain routes to achieve near-optimal trade-offs between competing objectives, approximating Pareto front sets. The results demonstrate that the primary approach provides the most balanced trade-off between optimality, diversity, and density, further enhanced with a shared experience buffer that allows knowledge transfer among policies. In complex settings, it achieves up to 75\% higher hypervolume than the MOEA-based method and generates solutions that are approximately eleven times denser, signifying better robustness, than those produced by the modified single-objective RL method. Moreover, it ensures stable production and inventory levels while minimising demand loss.</p></details> |  |

While imitation learning in discrete settings such as autoregressive language modeling has seen immense success and popularity in recent years, imitation in physical settings such as autonomous driving and robot learning has proven comparably more complex due to the compounding errors problem, often requiring elaborate set-ups to perform stably. Recent work has demonstrated that even in benign settings, exponential compounding errors are unavoidable when learning solely from expert-controlled trajectories, suggesting the need for more advanced policy parameterizations or data augmentation. To this end, we present minimal interventions that provably mitigate compounding errors in continuous state-and-action imitation learning. When the system is open-loop stable, we prescribe "action chunking," i.e., predicting and playing sequences of actions in open-loop; when the system is possibly unstable, we prescribe "noise injection," i.e., adding noise during expert demonstrations. These interventions align with popular choices in modern robot learning, though the benefits we derive are distinct from the effects they were designed to target. Our results draw insights and tools from both control theory and reinforcement learning; however, our analysis reveals novel considerations that do not naturally arise when either literature is considered in isolation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Expos...</summary><p>Exposition and experiments have been deemed insufficient.

However, traditional RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with 128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\% to 85.1\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\% to 61.9\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the community.</p></details> | 12 pages |

While state-of-the-art models show promise, they often falter when faced with complex problems that demand deep conceptual understanding and intricate, multi-step deliberation. To address this challenge, we introduce JT-Math-8B, a series of open-source models comprising base, instruct, and thinking versions, built upon a systematic, multi-stage optimization framework. Our pre-training corpus is a high-quality, 210B-token dataset curated through a dedicated data pipeline that uses model-based validation to ensure quality and diversity. The Instruct Model is optimized for direct, concise answers through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a GRPO-based reinforcement learning (RL) method. The Thinking Model is trained for complex problem-solving using a Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) approach, combining SFT with a novel, multi-stage RL curriculum that progressively increases task difficulty and context length up to 32K tokens. JT-Math-8B achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models of similar size, surpassing prominent models like OpenAI's O1-mini and GPT-4o , and demonstrating superior performance on competition-level mathematics.</p></details> |  |

However, indoor environments such as long straight corridors can cause severe degeneracy problems in SLAM. In this paper, we use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train an adaptive degeneracy optimization agent (DOA) to address degeneracy problem. We propose a systematic methodology to address three critical challenges in traditional supervised learning frameworks: (1) data acquisition bottlenecks in degenerate dataset, (2) inherent quality deterioration of training samples, and (3) ambiguity in annotation protocol design. We design a specialized reward function to guide the agent in developing perception capabilities for degenerate environments. Using the output degeneracy factor as a reference weight, the agent can dynamically adjust the contribution of different sensors to pose optimization. Specifically, the observation distribution is shifted towards the motion model distribution, with the step size determined by a linear interpolation formula related to the degeneracy factor. In addition, we employ a transfer learning module to endow the agent with generalization capabilities across different environments and address the inefficiency of training in degenerate environments. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the rationality of our model design and the role of transfer learning. We also compare the proposed DOA with SOTA methods to prove its superior degeneracy detection and optimization capabilities across various environments.</p></details> | 10 pages,9 figures |

Although the theory has been extensively developed, we are still lacking efficient and scalable computational methods. Here, we develop reinforcement learning methods for such games in a finite space setting with general dynamics and reward functions. We start by proving that the MFTG solution yields approximate Nash equilibria in finite-size coalition games. We then propose two algorithms. The first is based on the quantization of mean-field spaces and Nash Q-learning. We provide convergence and stability analysis. We then propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which can scale to larger spaces. Numerical experiments in 4 environments with mean-field distributions of dimension up to $200$ show the scalability and efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

The key of the proposed methodology is to better explore the solution space by simulating and composing the stochastic processes using pre-trained deep learning (DL) models. We demonstrate our approach on a challenging real-world application, the multi-sourcing multi-period inventory management problem in supply chain optimization. In particular, we employ deep RL models for learning and forecasting the stochastic supply chain processes under a range of assumptions. Moreover, we also introduce a constraint coordination mechanism, designed to forecast dual costs given the cross-products constraints in the inventory network. We highlight that instead of directly modeling the complex physical constraints into the RL optimization problem and solving the stochastic problem as a whole, our approach breaks down those supply chain processes into scalable and composable DL modules, leading to improved performance on large real-world datasets. We also outline open problems for future research to further investigate the efficacy of such models.</p></details> |  |

Intrinsic Motivation~(IM) methods -- which introduce exploration rewards -- are an effective solution to reward-sparsity. However, IM also causes an issue known as `reward hacking' where the agent optimizes for the new reward at the expense of properly playing the game. The larger problem is that reward hacking itself is largely unknown; there is no answer to whether, and to what extent, IM rewards change the behavior of RL agents. This study takes a first step by empirically evaluating the impact on behavior of three IM techniques on the MiniGrid game-like environment. We compare these IM models with Generalized Reward Matching~(GRM), a method that can be used with any intrinsic reward function to guarantee optimality. Our results suggest that IM causes noticeable change by increasing the initial rewards, but also altering the way the agent plays; and that GRM mitigated reward hacking in some scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Existing studies often overlook the intricate interdependencies between missions and the costs associated with offloading tasks to edge servers, leading to suboptimal decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach. First, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm, namely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline for one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and multi-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment time and improving adaptability over baseline methods. Extensive simulations reveal that CGG-ARO improves the number of completed missions and overall benefit by approximately 7.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, MA-DDQN achieves even greater improvements of 11.0% in terms of mission completions and 12.5% in terms of the overall benefit. These results highlight the effectiveness of Oranits in enabling faster, more adaptive, and more efficient task processing in dynamic ITS environments.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

While individual success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment, multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments, and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy learning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Workshop on Computational Optimization of Buildings (ICML CO-BUILD), 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025), Vancouver, Canada</p></details> |

While classical network metrics, such as latency and packet loss, remain significant, they are insufficient to quantify the nuanced information quality requirements of modern intelligent applications, including autonomous vehicles, digital twins, and metaverse environments. In this survey, we present the first comprehensive study of the ``X of Information'' continuum by introducing a systematic four-dimensional taxonomic framework that structures information metrics along temporal, quality/utility, reliability/robustness, and network/communication dimensions. We uncover the increasing interdependencies among these dimensions, whereby temporal freshness triggers quality evaluation, which in turn helps with reliability appraisal, ultimately enabling effective network delivery. Our analysis reveals that artificial intelligence technologies, such as deep reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and neural optimization models, enable adaptive, context-aware optimization of competing information quality objectives. In our extensive study of six critical application domains, covering autonomous transportation, industrial IoT, healthcare digital twins, UAV communications, LLM ecosystems, and metaverse settings, we illustrate the revolutionary promise of multi-dimensional information metrics for meeting diverse operational needs.

However, conventional rule-based and model-predictive methods often lack the adaptability and generalization needed to handle the nonlinear and environment-dependent complexities of AP. To address these limitations, we propose a reward-augmented learning framework for AP (RARLAP), that mitigates the inherent complexities of continuous-domain control by leveraging structured reward design to induce smooth and adaptable policy behavior, trained entirely within a high-fidelity Unity-based custom 3D simulation environment. We systematically design and assess three structured reward strategies: goal-only reward (GOR), dense proximity reward (DPR), and milestone-augmented reward (MAR), each integrated with both on-policy and off-policy optimization paradigms. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the on-policy MAR achieves a 91\% success rate, yielding smoother trajectories and more robust behavior, while GOR and DPR fail to guide effective learning. Convergence and trajectory analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances policy adaptability, accelerates training, and improves safety in continuous control. Overall, RARLAP establishes that reward augmentation effectively addresses complex autonomous parking challenges, enabling scalable and efficient policy optimization with both on- and off-policy methods. To support reproducibility, the code accompanying this paper is publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Making sound trading decisions to generate profit is particularly difficult under such conditions. To address this, we propose four novel loss functions to drive decision-making for a portfolio of stocks. These functions account for the potential profits or losses based with respect to buying or shorting respective stocks, enabling potentially any artificial neural network to directly learn an effective trading strategy. Despite the high volatility in stock market fluctuations over time, training time-series models such as transformers on these loss functions resulted in trading strategies that generated significant profits on a portfolio of 50 different S&P 500 company stocks as compared to a benchmark reinforcment learning techniques and a baseline buy and hold method. As an example, using 2021, 2022 and 2023 as three test periods, the Crossformer model adapted with our best loss function was most consistent, resulting in returns of 51.42%, 51.04% and 48.62% respectively. In comparison, the best performing state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods, PPO and DDPG, only delivered maximum profits of around 41%, 2.81% and 41.58% for the same periods.

However, obtaining a robust and dense reward signal for general manipulation tasks remains a challenge. Existing learning-based approaches require significant data, such as human demonstrations of success and failure, to learn task-specific reward functions. Recently, there is also a growing adoption of large multi-modal foundation models for robotics that can perform visual reasoning in physical contexts and generate coarse robot motions for manipulation tasks. Motivated by this range of capability, in this work, we present Keypoint-based Affordance Guidance for Improvements (KAGI), a method leveraging rewards shaped by vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous RL. State-of-the-art VLMs have demonstrated impressive zero-shot reasoning about affordances through keypoints, and we use these to define dense rewards that guide autonomous robotic learning. On diverse real-world manipulation tasks specified by natural language descriptions, KAGI improves the sample efficiency of autonomous RL and enables successful task completion in 30K online fine-tuning steps. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of KAGI to reductions in the number of in-domain demonstrations used for pre-training, reaching similar performance in 45K online fine-tuning steps.

Additionally, the unprecedented success of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity, knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks, utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology, aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Multi-Year Asset Management Under Budget Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19458v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Budget planning and maintenance optimization are crucial for infrastructure asset management, ensuring cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and consistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEPA: Reflective Prompt Evolution Can Outperform Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse, scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer, MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an inference-time search strategy for code optimization.</p></details> |  |

We recast context-based RL as a dual inference-control problem and formally characterize two properties and their hierarchy: observation sufficiency (preserving all predictive information) and control sufficiency (retaining decision-making relevant information). Exploiting this dichotomy, we derive a contextual evidence lower bound(ELBO)-style objective that cleanly separates representation learning from policy learning and optimizes it with Bottlenecked Contextual Policy Optimization (BCPO), an algorithm that places a variational information-bottleneck encoder in front of any off-policy policy learner. On standard continuous-control benchmarks with shifting physical parameters, BCPO matches or surpasses other baselines while using fewer samples and retaining performance far outside the training regime. The framework unifies theory, diagnostics, and practice for context-based RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Scheduling for Wi-Fi Multi-Access Point Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19377v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key feature of IEEE 802.11bn, with a potential impact on future Wi-Fi networks. MAPC enables joint scheduling decisions across multiple access points (APs) to improve throughput, latency, and reliability in dense Wi-Fi deployments. However, implementing efficient scheduling policies under diverse traffic and interference conditions in overlapping basic service sets (OBSSs) remains a complex task. This paper presents a method to minimize the network-wide worst-case latency by formulating MAPC scheduling as a sequential decision-making problem and proposing a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) mechanism to minimize worst-case delays in OBSS deployments. Specifically, we train a DRL agent using proximal policy optimization (PPO) within an 802.11bn-compatible Gymnasium environment. This environment provides observations of queue states, delay metrics, and channel conditions, enabling the agent to schedule multiple AP-station pairs to transmit simultaneously by leveraging spatial reuse (SR) groups. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed solution outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic strategies across a wide range of network loads and traffic patterns. The trained machine learning (ML) models consistently achieve lower 99th-percentile delays, showing up to a 30% improvement over the best baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Machine Learning in Communications and Networking</p></details> |
| **[DoctorAgent-RL: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Reinforcement Learning System for Multi-Turn Clinical Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19630v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Single-round consultation systems require patients to describe all symptoms upfront, leading to vague diagnosis with unclear complaints. Traditional multi-turn dialogue models, constrained by static supervised learning, lack flexibility and fail to intelligently extract key clinical information. To address these limitations, we propose \Ours{}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent, dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient interactions. Experiments demonstrate that \Ours{} outperforms existing models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic performance. This approach shows immense practical value by reducing misdiagnosis risks in time-pressured settings, freeing clinicians for complex cases, and pioneering a strategy to optimize medical resource allocation and alleviate workforce shortages.

| **[Controlling Topological Defects in Polar Fluids via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19298v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological defects in active polar fluids exhibit complex dynamics driven by internally generated stresses, reflecting the deep interplay between topology, flow, and non-equilibrium hydrodynamics. Feedback control offers a powerful means to guide such systems, enabling transitions between dynamic states. We investigated closed-loop steering of integer-charged defects in a confined active fluid by modulating the spatial profile of activity. Using a continuum hydrodynamic model, we show that localized control of active stress induces flow fields that can reposition and direct defects along prescribed trajectories by exploiting non-linear couplings in the system. A reinforcement learning framework is used to discover effective control strategies that produce robust defect transport across both trained and novel trajectories. The results highlight how AI agents can learn the underlying dynamics and spatially structure activity to manipulate topological excitations, offering insights into the controllability of active matter and the design of adaptive, self-organized materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[RemoteReasoner: Towards Unifying Geospatial Reasoning Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19280v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data, demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Delphos: A reinforcement learning framework for assisting discrete choice model specification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06410v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Delphos, a deep reinforcement learning framework for assisting the discrete choice model specification process. Unlike traditional approaches that treat model specification as a static optimisation problem, Delphos represents a paradigm shift: it frames this specification challenge as a sequential decision-making problem, formalised as a Markov Decision Process. In this setting, an agent learns to specify well-performing model candidates by choosing a sequence of modelling actions - such as selecting variables, accommodating both generic and alternative-specific taste parameters, applying non-linear transformations, and including interactions with covariates - and interacting with a modelling environment that estimates each candidate and returns a reward signal. Specifically, Delphos uses a Deep Q-Network that receives delayed rewards based on modelling outcomes (e.g., log-likelihood) and behavioural expectations (e.g., parameter signs), and distributes rewards across the sequence of actions to learn which modelling decisions lead to well-performing candidates. We evaluate Delphos on both simulated and empirical datasets, varying the size of the modelling space and the reward function. To assess the agent's performance in navigating the model space, we analyse the learning curve, the distribution of Q-values, occupancy metrics, and Pareto fronts. Our results show that the agent learns to adaptively explore strategies to identify well-performing models across search spaces, even without prior domain knowledge. It efficiently explores large modelling spaces, concentrates its search in high-reward regions, and suggests candidates that define Pareto frontiers balancing model fit and behavioural plausibility. These findings highlight the potential of this novel adaptive, learning-based framework to assist in the model specification process.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Recently, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods have been showing promising potential to address this complexity. However, the lack of a systematic benchmarking framework and thorough analysis hinders the exploration of emerging networks and the development of more robust algorithms while causing inconsistent evaluation. In this paper, we introduce Virne, a comprehensive benchmarking framework for the NFV-RA problem, with a focus on supporting deep RL-based methods. Virne provides customizable simulations for diverse network scenarios, including cloud, edge, and 5G environments. It also features a modular and extensible implementation pipeline that supports over 30 methods of various types, and includes practical evaluation perspectives beyond effectiveness, such as scalability, generalization, and scalability. Furthermore, we conduct in-depth analysis through extensive experiments to provide valuable insights into performance trade-offs for efficient implementation and offer actionable guidance for future research directions. Overall, with its diverse simulations, rich implementations, and extensive evaluation capabilities, Virne could serve as a comprehensive benchmark for advancing NFV-RA methods and deep RL applications.

| **[Prolonging Tool Life: Learning Skillful Use of General-purpose Tools through Lifespan-guided Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17275v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In inaccessible environments with uncertain task demands, robots often rely on general-purpose tools that lack predefined usage strategies. These tools are not tailored for particular operations, making their longevity highly sensitive to how they are used. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot learn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's lifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a factor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based on accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide policy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL can only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward Normalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on estimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across simulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and Door-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. The learned policies consistently prolong tool lifespan (up to 8.01x in simulation) and transfer effectively to real-world settings, demonstrating the practical value of learning lifespan-guided tool use strategies.</p></details> | Under review |

However, existing models and datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive diversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models, typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns. Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate, we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles. Extensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Addressing this gap, we propose PennyCoder, a novel lightweight framework for quantum code generation, explicitly designed for local and embedded deployment to enable on-device quantum programming assistance without external API dependence. PennyCoder leverages a fine-tuned version of the LLaMA 3.1-8B model, adapted through parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques combined with domain-specific instruction tuning optimized for the specialized syntax and computational logic of quantum programming in PennyLane, including tasks in quantum machine learning and quantum reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work focused on cloud-based quantum code generation, our approach emphasizes device-native operability while maintaining high model efficacy. We rigorously evaluated PennyCoder over a comprehensive quantum programming dataset, achieving 44.3% accuracy with our fine-tuned model (compared to 33.7% for the base LLaMA 3.1-8B and 40.1% for the RAG-augmented baseline), demonstrating a significant improvement in functional correctness.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, paper accepted to QCE 2025</p></details> |

While model-based controllers provide precise planning via online optimization, they are limited by model inaccuracies. In contrast, learning-based methods offer robustness, but they struggle with precise modulation of interaction forces. We introduce RAMBO, a hybrid framework that integrates model-based whole-body control within a feedback policy trained with reinforcement learning. The model-based module generates feedforward torques by solving a quadratic program, while the policy provides feedback corrective terms to enhance robustness. We validate our framework on a quadruped robot across a diverse set of real-world loco-manipulation tasks, such as pushing a shopping cart, balancing a plate, and holding soft objects, in both quadrupedal and bipedal walking. Our experiments demonstrate that RAMBO enables precise manipulation capabilities while achieving robust and dynamic locomotion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

Two particularly popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.</p></details> |  |

However, handcrafted constraints can fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate, context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines. We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the degree to which it relies on this controller.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement learning (RL), a prominent method in end-to-end driving, enables agents to learn through trial and error in simulation. However, RL training often relies on rule-based traffic scenarios, limiting generalization. Additionally, current scenario generation methods focus heavily on critical scenarios, neglecting a balance with routine driving behaviors. Curriculum learning, which progressively trains agents on increasingly complex tasks, is a promising approach to improving the robustness and coverage of RL driving policies. However, existing research mainly emphasizes manually designed curricula, focusing on scenery and actor placement rather than traffic behavior dynamics. This work introduces a novel student-teacher framework for automatic curriculum learning. The teacher, a graph-based multi-agent RL component, adaptively generates traffic behaviors across diverse difficulty levels. An adaptive mechanism adjusts task difficulty based on student performance, ensuring exposure to behaviors ranging from common to critical. The student, though exchangeable, is realized as a deep RL agent with partial observability, reflecting real-world perception constraints. Results demonstrate the teacher's ability to generate diverse traffic behaviors. The student, trained with automatic curricula, outperformed agents trained on rule-based traffic, achieving higher rewards and exhibiting balanced, assertive driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AI Enabled 6G for Semantic Metaverse: Prospects, Challenges and Solutions for Future Wireless VR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19124v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wireless support of virtual reality (VR) has challenges when a network has multiple users, particularly for 3D VR gaming, digital AI avatars, and remote team collaboration. This work addresses these challenges through investigation of the low-rank channels that inevitably occur when there are more active users than there are degrees of spatial freedom, effectively often the number of antennas. The presented approach uses optimal nonlinear transceivers, equivalently generalized decision-feedback or successive cancellation for uplink and superposition or dirty-paper precoders for downlink. Additionally, a powerful optimization approach for the users' energy allocation and decoding order appears to provide large improvements over existing methods, effectively nearing theoretical optima. As the latter optimization methods pose real-time challenges, approximations using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) are used to approximate best performance with much lower (5x at least) complexity. Experimental results show significantly larger sum rates and very large power savings to attain the data rates found necessary to support VR. Experimental results show the proposed algorithm outperforms current industry standards like orthogonal multiple access (OMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), as well as the highly researched methods in multi-carrier NOMA (MC-NOMA), enhancing sum data rate by 39%, 28%, and 16%, respectively, at a given power level. For the same data rate, it achieves power savings of 75%, 45%, and 40%, making it ideal for VR applications. Additionally, a near-optimal deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation framework for real-time use by being 5x faster and reaching 83% of the global optimum is introduced.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Wireless Communications Magazine</p></details> |

Observational learning enables intuitive human skills transfer through hands-on demonstrations, but relying solely on visual input can be inefficient in terms of scalability and failure mitigation, especially when based on a single demonstration. This paper presents a human-in-the-loop method for enhancing the robot execution plan, automatically generated based on a single RGB video, with natural language input to a Large Language Model (LLM). By including user-specified goals or critical task aspects and exploiting the LLM common-sense reasoning, the system adjusts the vision-based plan to prevent potential failures and adapts it based on the received instructions. Experiments demonstrated the framework intuitiveness and effectiveness in correcting vision-derived errors and adapting plans without requiring additional demonstrations. Moreover, interactive plan refinement and hallucination corrections promoted system robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often struggle with accuracy due to epistemic uncertainty or the sim-to-real gap. For instance, accurately pouring liquid from one container to another poses challenges, particularly when models are trained on limited demonstrations and may perform poorly in novel situations. This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm designed to mitigate these inaccuracies. By incorporating estimates of model uncertainty, the proposed MCTS strategy biases the search towards actions with lower predicted uncertainty. This approach enhances the reliability of planning under uncertain conditions. Applied to a liquid pouring task, our method demonstrates improved success rates even with models trained on minimal data, outperforming traditional methods and showcasing its potential for robust decision-making in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/RSJ IROS 2025</p></details> |

A critical challenge is the agent's ability to identify and monitor environmental elements pertinent to its objectives. Our research introduces a neurosymbolic modular architecture for reactive robotics. Our system combines a neural component performing object recognition over the environment and image processing techniques such as optical flow, with symbolic representation and reasoning. The reasoning system is grounded in the embodied cognition paradigm, via integrating image schematic knowledge in an ontological structure. The ontology is operatively used to create queries for the perception system, decide on actions, and infer entities' capabilities derived from perceptual data. The combination of reasoning and image processing allows the agent to focus its perception for normal operation as well as discover new concepts for parts of objects involved in particular interactions. The discovered concepts allow the robot to autonomously acquire training data and adjust its subsymbolic perception to recognize the parts, as well as making planning for more complex tasks feasible by focusing search on those relevant object parts. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated world, in which an agent learns to recognize parts of objects involved in support relations. While the agent has no concept of handle initially, by observing examples of supported objects hanging from a hook it learns to recognize the parts involved in establishing support and becomes able to plan the establishment/destruction of the support relation. This underscores the agent's capability to expand its knowledge through observation in a systematic way, and illustrates the potential of combining deep reasoning [...].</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is published online with Open Access by IOS Press and distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License 4.0 (CC BY-NC 4.0)</p></details> |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data, such as GPT-4o, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across both text and images. But can they truly be used for this task in a zero-shot setting? And what are their limitations? In this paper, we explore these research questions via the free-form language-based robotic grasping task, and propose a novel method, FreeGrasp, leveraging the pre-trained VLMs' world knowledge to reason about human instructions and object spatial arrangements. Our method detects all objects as keypoints and uses these keypoints to annotate marks on images, aiming to facilitate GPT-4o's zero-shot spatial reasoning. This allows our method to determine whether a requested object is directly graspable or if other objects must be grasped and removed first. Since no existing dataset is specifically designed for this task, we introduce a synthetic dataset FreeGraspData by extending the MetaGraspNetV2 dataset with human-annotated instructions and ground-truth grasping sequences. We conduct extensive analyses with both FreeGraspData and real-world validation with a gripper-equipped robotic arm, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in grasp reasoning and execution.

This paper presents MRHaD, a Mixed Reality-based Hand-drawn Map Editing Interface that enables intuitive, real-time map modifications through natural hand gestures. By integrating the MR head-mounted display with the robotic navigation system, operators can directly create hand-drawn restricted zones (HRZ), thereby bridging the gap between 2D map representations and the real-world environment. Comparative experiments against conventional 2D editing methods demonstrate that MRHaD significantly improves editing efficiency, map accuracy, and overall usability, contributing to safer and more efficient mobile robot operations.

| **[Bipedalism for Quadrupedal Robots: Versatile Loco-Manipulation through Risk-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20382v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loco-manipulation of quadrupedal robots has broadened robotic applications, but using legs as manipulators often compromises locomotion, while mounting arms complicates the system. To mitigate this issue, we introduce bipedalism for quadrupedal robots, thus freeing the front legs for versatile interactions with the environment. We propose a risk-adaptive distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework designed for quadrupedal robots walking on their hind legs, balancing worst-case conservativeness with optimal performance in this inherently unstable task. During training, the adaptive risk preference is dynamically adjusted based on the uncertainty of the return, measured by the coefficient of variation of the estimated return distribution. Extensive experiments in simulation show our method's superior performance over baselines. Real-world deployment on a Unitree Go2 robot further demonstrates the versatility of our policy, enabling tasks like cart pushing, obstacle probing, and payload transport, while showcasing robustness against challenging dynamics and external disturbances.</p></details> | Humanoids 2025 |
| **[Tactile-Guided Robotic Ultrasound: Mapping Preplanned Scan Paths for Intercostal Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20282v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used in clinical examinations due to its portability, real-time capability, and radiation-free nature. To address inter- and intra-operator variability, robotic ultrasound systems have gained increasing attention. However, their application in challenging intercostal imaging remains limited due to the lack of an effective scan path generation method within the constrained acoustic window. To overcome this challenge, we explore the potential of tactile cues for characterizing subcutaneous rib structures as an alternative signal for ultrasound segmentation-free bone surface point cloud extraction. Compared to 2D US images, 1D tactile-related signals offer higher processing efficiency and are less susceptible to acoustic noise and artifacts. By leveraging robotic tracking data, a sparse tactile point cloud is generated through a few scans along the rib, mimicking human palpation. To robustly map the scanning trajectory into the intercostal space, the sparse tactile bone location point cloud is first interpolated to form a denser representation. This refined point cloud is then registered to an image-based dense bone surface point cloud, enabling accurate scan path mapping for individual patients. Additionally, to ensure full coverage of the object of interest, we introduce an automated tilt angle adjustment method to visualize structures beneath the bone. To validate the proposed method, we conducted comprehensive experiments on four distinct phantoms. The final scanning waypoint mapping achieved Mean Nearest Neighbor Distance (MNND) and Hausdorff distance (HD) errors of 3.41 mm and 3.65 mm, respectively, while the reconstructed object beneath the bone had errors of 0.69 mm and 2.2 mm compared to the CT ground truth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS2025, video link: https://youtu.be/SBwpFVzEhAg</p></details> |
| **[Humanoid Occupancy: Enabling A Generalized Multimodal Occupancy Perception System on Humanoid Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20217v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robot technology is advancing rapidly, with manufacturers introducing diverse heterogeneous visual perception modules tailored to specific scenarios. Among various perception paradigms, occupancy-based representation has become widely recognized as particularly suitable for humanoid robots, as it provides both rich semantic and 3D geometric information essential for comprehensive environmental understanding. In this work, we present Humanoid Occupancy, a generalized multimodal occupancy perception system that integrates hardware and software components, data acquisition devices, and a dedicated annotation pipeline. Our framework employs advanced multi-modal fusion techniques to generate grid-based occupancy outputs encoding both occupancy status and semantic labels, thereby enabling holistic environmental understanding for downstream tasks such as task planning and navigation. To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome issues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective sensor layout strategy. Furthermore, we have developed the first panoramic occupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable benchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The network architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal information integration to ensure robust perception. Overall, Humanoid Occupancy delivers effective environmental perception for humanoid robots and establishes a technical foundation for standardizing universal visual modules, paving the way for the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in complex real-world scenarios.</p></details> | Tech Report |
| **[Robotic Visual Instruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00693v3)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot interaction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision introduces challenges for robotic task definition such as ambiguity and verbosity. Moreover, in some public settings where quiet is required, such as libraries or hospitals, verbal communication with robots is inappropriate. To address these limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows, circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from 2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable 3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment,enabling them to effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements.

However, validating such systems is challenging due to the complexity of the space environment, necessitating a verification and validation (V&V) process that bridges simulation and real-world behavior. The key contribution of this paper is a unified, end-to-end digital and robotic twinning framework that enables software- and hardware-in-the-loop testing for multi-modal GNC systems. The robotic twin includes three testbeds at Stanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB): the GNSS and Radiofrequency Autonomous Navigation Testbed for Distributed Space Systems (GRAND) to validate RF-based navigation techniques, and the Testbed for Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) and Optical Stimulator (OS) to validate vision-based methods. The test article for this work is an integrated multi-modal GNC software stack for RPO and FF developed at SLAB. This paper introduces the hybrid framework and summarizes calibration and error characterization for the robotic twin. Then, the GNC stack's performance and robustness is characterized using the integrated digital and robotic twinning pipeline for a full-range RPO mission scenario in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). The results shown in the paper demonstrate consistency between digital and robotic twins, validating the hybrid twinning pipeline as a reliable framework for realistic assessment and verification of GNC systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 12 figures. 2025 Astrodynamics Specialist Conference</p></details> |
| **[Robot Excavation and Manipulation of Geometrically Cohesive Granular Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19999v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Construction throughout history typically assumes that its blueprints and building blocks are pre-determined. However, recent work suggests that alternative approaches can enable new paradigms for structure formation. Aleatory architectures, or those which rely on the properties of their granular building blocks rather than pre-planned design or computation, have thus far relied on human intervention for their creation. We imagine that robotic swarms could be valuable to create such aleatory structures by manipulating and forming structures from entangled granular materials. To discover principles by which robotic systems can effectively manipulate soft matter, we develop a robophysical model for interaction with geometrically cohesive granular media composed of u-shape particles. This robotic platform uses environmental signals to autonomously coordinate excavation, transport, and deposition of material. We test the effect of substrate initial conditions by characterizing robot performance in two different material compaction states and observe as much as a 75% change in transported mass depending on initial substrate compressive loading. These discrepancies suggest the functional role that material properties such as packing and cohesion/entanglement play in excavation and construction. To better understand these material properties, we develop an apparatus for tensile testing of the geometrically cohesive substrates, which reveals how entangled material strength responds strongly to initial compressive loading. These results explain the variation observed in robotic performance and point to future directions for better understanding robotic interaction mechanics with entangled materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[A roadmap for AI in robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19975v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI technologies, including deep learning, large-language models have gone from one breakthrough to the other. As a result, we are witnessing growing excitement in robotics at the prospect of leveraging the potential of AI to tackle some of the outstanding barriers to the full deployment of robots in our daily lives. However, action and sensing in the physical world pose greater and different challenges than analysing data in isolation. As the development and application of AI in robotic products advances, it is important to reflect on which technologies, among the vast array of network architectures and learning models now available in the AI field, are most likely to be successfully applied to robots; how they can be adapted to specific robot designs, tasks, environments; which challenges must be overcome. This article offers an assessment of what AI for robotics has achieved since the 1990s and proposes a short- and medium-term research roadmap listing challenges and promises. These range from keeping up-to-date large datasets, representatives of a diversity of tasks robots may have to perform, and of environments they may encounter, to designing AI algorithms tailored specifically to robotics problems but generic enough to apply to a wide range of applications and transfer easily to a variety of robotic platforms. For robots to collaborate effectively with humans, they must predict human behavior without relying on bias-based profiling. Explainability and transparency in AI-driven robot control are not optional but essential for building trust, preventing misuse, and attributing responsibility in accidents. We close on what we view as the primary long-term challenges, that is, to design robots capable of lifelong learning, while guaranteeing safe deployment and usage, and sustainable computational costs.</p></details> |  |

However, an uncertainty-aware fusion framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network (FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot collaborative task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)</p></details> |

In this technical report, safety refers to ensuring that the robot respects state and input constraints while avoiding collisions with obstacles despite the presence of disturbances and measurement noise. This report offers a step-by-step approach to implementing Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) schemes addressing these safety requirements. Numerous books and survey papers provide comprehensive overviews of linear MPC (LMPC), NMPC, and their applications in various domains, including robotics. This report does not aim to replicate those exhaustive reviews. Instead, it focuses specifically on NMPC as a foundation for safe mobile robot navigation. The goal is to provide a practical and accessible path from theoretical concepts to mathematical proofs and implementation, emphasizing safety and performance guarantees. It is intended for researchers, robotics engineers, and practitioners seeking to bridge the gap between theoretical NMPC formulations and real-world robotic applications.

| **[Think, Act, Learn: A Framework for Autonomous Robotic Agents using Closed-Loop Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19854v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked unprecedented capabilities in high-level task planning. However, most current systems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners, rendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in dynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the "Think, Act, Learn" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that enables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through continuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an LLM first "thinks" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans. The robot then "acts" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal sensory feedback. Critically, the "learn" module processes this feedback to facilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal analysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are stored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We demonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world that our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including open-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning. Our framework achieves over a 97% success rate on complex, long-horizon tasks, converges to a stable policy in an average of just 9 trials, and exhibits remarkable generalization to unseen tasks. This work presents a significant step towards developing more robust, adaptive, and truly autonomous robotic agents.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Existing methods, for multi-view robotic systems, usually rely on accurate geometric models or manual assistance, generalize poorly, and can be very complicated and inefficient. Therefore, in this study, we propose PlaneHEC, a generalized hand-eye calibration method that does not require complex models and can be accomplished using only depth cameras, which achieves the optimal and fastest calibration results using arbitrary planar surfaces like walls and tables. PlaneHEC introduces hand-eye calibration equations based on planar constraints, which makes it strongly interpretable and generalizable. PlaneHEC also uses a comprehensive solution that starts with a closed-form solution and improves it withiterative optimization, which greatly improves accuracy. We comprehensively evaluated the performance of PlaneHEC in both simulated and real-world environments and compared the results with other point-cloud-based calibration methods, proving its superiority. Our approach achieves universal and fast calibration with an innovative design of computational models, providing a strong contribution to the development of multi-agent systems and embodied intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |
| **[DogLegs: Robust Proprioceptive State Estimation for Legged Robots Using Multiple Leg-Mounted IMUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04580v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate proprioceptive state estimation of the main body is crucial for legged robots to execute tasks in extreme environments where exteroceptive sensors, such as LiDARs and cameras, may become unreliable. In this paper, we propose DogLegs, a state estimation system for legged robots that fuses the measurements from a body-mounted inertial measurement unit (Body-IMU), joint encoders, and multiple leg-mounted IMUs (Leg-IMU) using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The filter system contains the error states of all IMU frames. The Leg-IMUs are used to detect foot contact, thereby providing zero-velocity measurements to update the state of the Leg-IMU frames. Additionally, we compute the relative position constraints between the Body-IMU and Leg-IMUs by the leg kinematics and use them to update the main body state and reduce the error drift of the individual IMU frames. Field experimental results have shown that our proposed DogLegs system achieves better state estimation accuracy compared to the traditional leg odometry method (using only Body-IMU and joint encoders) across various terrains. We make our datasets publicly available to benefit the research community (https://github.com/YibinWu/leg-odometry).</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

The synergistic reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction. Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning, (3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically, the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability and generalization.

In contrast, lighter-than-air flapping-wing robots, inspired by animal movement, offer a soft, quiet, and touch-safe alternative. Building on these advantages, we present Cuddle-Fish, a soft flapping-wing floating robot designed for close-proximity interactions in indoor spaces. Through a user study with 24 participants, we explored their perceptions of the robot and experiences during a series of co-located demonstrations in which the robot moved near them. Results showed that participants felt safe, willingly engaged in touch-based interactions with the robot, and exhibited spontaneous affective behaviours, such as patting, stroking, hugging, and cheek-touching, without external prompting. They also reported positive emotional responses towards the robot. These findings suggest that the soft floating robot with flapping wings can serve as a novel and socially acceptable alternative to traditional rigid flying robots, opening new potential for applications in companionship, affective interaction, and play in everyday indoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Augme...</summary><p>Augmented Humans International Conference 2025 (AHs '25)</p></details> |

This paper proposes a re-planning strategy using a multilayer planning and control framework for cases where the robot's environment is partially known. A medial axis graph-based planner defines a global path plan based on known obstacles, where each edge in the graph corresponds to a unique corridor. A mixed-integer model predictive control (MPC) method detects if a terminal constraint derived from the global plan is infeasible, subject to a non-convex description of the local environment. Infeasibility detection is used to trigger efficient global re-planning via medial axis graph edge deletion. The proposed re-planning strategy is demonstrated experimentally.</p></details> |  |

This work aims to develop an accurate localization system applicable to swarm robots equipped only with low-cost monocular vision sensors and visual markers. The system is designed to operate in fully open spaces, without landmarks or support from positioning infrastructures. To achieve this, we propose a localization method based on equilateral triangular formations. By leveraging the geometric properties of equilateral triangles, the accurate two-dimensional position of each participating robot is estimated using one-dimensional lateral distance information between robots, which can be reliably and accurately obtained with a low-cost monocular vision sensor. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that, as travel time increases, the positioning error of the proposed method becomes significantly smaller than that of a conventional dead-reckoning system, another low-cost localization approach applicable to open environments.</p></details> |  |

Exploring how Robot Morphology Shapes Perceived Affordances via a Mise en Place Scenario in a VR Kitchen](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19082v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores which factors of the visual design of a robot may influence how humans would place it in a collaborative cooking scenario and how these features may influence task delegation. Human participants were placed in a Virtual Reality (VR) environment and asked to set up a kitchen for cooking alongside a robot companion while considering the robot's morphology. We collected multimodal data for the arrangements created by the participants, transcripts of their think-aloud as they were performing the task, and transcripts of their answers to structured post-task questionnaires. Based on analyzing this data, we formulate several hypotheses: humans prefer to collaborate with biomorphic robots; human beliefs about the sensory capabilities of robots are less influenced by the morphology of the robot than beliefs about action capabilities; and humans will implement fewer avoidance strategies when sharing space with gracile robots. We intend to verify these hypotheses in follow-up studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2025 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

While disturbance observers (DOB) can enhance system robustness, their performance is often limited by the elasticity of the joints and the variations in system parameters, which leads to a conservative design of the DOB. This paper presents a novel frequency response function (FRF)-based optimization method aimed at improving DOB performance, even in the presence of flexibility and system variability. The proposed method maximizes control bandwidth and effectively suppresses vibrations, thus enhancing overall system performance. Closed-loop stability is rigorously proven using the Nyquist stability criterion. Experimental validation on a FJR demonstrates that the proposed approach significantly improves robustness and motion performance, even under conditions of joint flexibility and system variation.</p></details> |  |

Force plates (FP) are considered the gold standard postural sway assessment method in laboratory conditions, but their lack of portability and requirement of high-level expertise limit their widespread usage. This study evaluates the reliability and validity of a novel Balance Mat (BM) device, a low-cost portable alternative that uses optical fibre technology. The research includes two studies: a robot study and a human study. In the robot study, a UR10 robotic arm was used to obtain controlled sway patterns to assess the reliability and sensitivity of the BM. In the human study, 51 healthy young participants performed balance tasks on the BM in combination with an FP to evaluate the BM's validity. Sway metrics such as sway mean, sway absolute mean, sway root mean square (RMS), sway path, sway range, and sway velocity were calculated from both BM and FP and compared. Reliability was evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), where values greater than 0.9 were considered excellent and values between 0.75 and 0.9 were considered good. Results from the robot study demonstrated good to excellent ICC values in both single and double-leg stances. The human study showed moderate to strong correlations for sway path and range. Using Bland-Altman plots for agreement analysis revealed proportional bias between the BM and the FP where the BM overestimated sway metrics compared to the FP. Calibration was used to improve the agreement between the devices. The device demonstrated consistent sway measurement across varied stance conditions, establishing both reliability and validity following appropriate calibration.</p></details> |  |

Even with extensive training data, unforeseen challenges--especially those that fundamentally alter task dynamics, such as unexpected obstacles or spatial constraints--can cause assistive policies to break down, leading to ineffective or unreliable assistance. To address this, we propose ILSA, an Incrementally Learned Shared Autonomy framework that continuously refines its assistive policy through user interactions, adapting to real-world challenges beyond the scope of pre-collected data. At the core of ILSA is a structured fine-tuning mechanism that enables continual improvement with each interaction by effectively integrating limited new interaction data while preserving prior knowledge, ensuring a balance between adaptation and generalization. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates ILSA's effectiveness, showing faster task completion and improved user experience compared to static alternatives.

| **[MP1: MeanFlow Tames Policy Learning in 1-step for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10543v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robot manipulation, robot learning has become a prevailing approach. However, generative models within this field face a fundamental trade-off between the slow, iterative sampling of diffusion models and the architectural constraints of faster Flow-based methods, which often rely on explicit consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs 3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning the interval-averaged velocity via the "MeanFlow Identity", our policy avoids any additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1 further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference. We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster than FlowPolicy. Our code is available at https://github.com/LogSSim/MP1.git.</p></details> |  |

More precise approaches focus almost exclusively on anthropomorphic features, which fail to classify robots across all types, limiting the ability to draw meaningful connections between robot design and its effect on interaction. In response, we present MetaMorph, a comprehensive framework for classifying robot morphology. Using a metamodeling approach, MetaMorph was synthesized from 222 robots in the IEEE Robots Guide, offering a structured method for comparing visual features. This model allows researchers to assess the visual distances between robot models and explore optimal design traits tailored to different tasks and contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2025 IEEE.

The two controllers fundamentally differ from each other as the first is formulated in task acceleration space and the latter is in task force space with passivity considerations. Even though both control methods predict stability under ideal conditions in closed-loop dynamics, their robustness against joint friction, sensor noise, unmodeled external disturbances, and non-perfect contact conditions is not evident. Therefore, we analyze and experimentally compare the two controllers on a humanoid robot platform through swing foot position and orientation control, squatting with and without unmodeled additional weights, and jumping. We also relate the observed performance and characteristic differences with the controller formulations and highlight each controller's advantages and disadvantages.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025). - Link to video: https://youtu.be/Nfm50ycz-FU</p></details> |

In particular, we guide the imitation learning procedures by transferring motions from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities while ensuring the physical feasibility of the target system. In the first stage, we focus on motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. Following this, we refine the motion at the dynamic level by adjusting it in the temporal domain while adhering to physical constraints. This process facilitates policy training via reinforcement learning, enabling precise and robust motion tracking. We demonstrate that our approach successfully transforms noisy motion sources, such as hand-held camera videos, into robot-specific motions that align with the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. Moreover, we demonstrate terrain-aware motion retargeting to perform BackFlip on top of a box. We successfully deployed these skills to four robots with different dimensions and physical properties in the real world through hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, videos available at https://taerimyoon.me/Spatio-Temporal-Motion-Retargeting-for-Quadruped-Robots/</p></details> |
| **[A Novel Monte-Carlo Compressed Sensing and Dictionary Learning Method for the Efficient Path Planning of Remote Sensing Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18462v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Compressed Sensing (CS) has gained significant interest as a technique for acquiring high-resolution sensory data using fewer measurements than traditional Nyquist sampling requires. At the same time, autonomous robotic platforms such as drones and rovers have become increasingly popular tools for remote sensing and environmental monitoring tasks, including measurements of temperature, humidity, and air quality. Within this context, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation into how the structure of CS measurement matrices can be exploited to design optimized sampling trajectories for robotic environmental data collection. We propose a novel Monte Carlo optimization framework that generates measurement matrices designed to minimize both the robot's traversal path length and the signal reconstruction error within the CS framework. Central to our approach is the application of Dictionary Learning (DL) to obtain a data-driven sparsifying transform, which enhances reconstruction accuracy while further reducing the number of samples that the robot needs to collect. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments reconstructing $NO_2$ pollution maps over the Gulf region. The results indicate that our approach can reduce robot travel distance to less than $10\%$ of a full-coverage path, while improving reconstruction accuracy by over a factor of five compared to traditional CS methods based on DCT and polynomial dictionaries, as well as by a factor of two compared to previously-proposed Informative Path Planning (IPP) methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[An Empirical Study on Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robot (EAIR) Software Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18267v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robots (EAIR) is an emerging and rapidly evolving technological domain. Ensuring their program correctness is fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs. To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15 distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards. Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction, detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compositional Coordination for Multi-Robot Teams with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16068v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot coordination has traditionally relied on a mission-specific and expert-driven pipeline, where natural language mission descriptions are manually translated by domain experts into mathematical formulation, algorithm design, and executable code. This conventional process is labor-intensive, inaccessible to non-experts, and inflexible to changes in mission requirements. Here, we propose LAN2CB (Language to Collective Behavior), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to streamline and generalize the multi-robot coordination pipeline. LAN2CB transforms natural language (NL) mission descriptions into executable Python code for multi-robot systems through two core modules: (1) Mission Analysis, which parses mission descriptions into behavior trees, and (2) Code Generation, which leverages the behavior tree and a structured knowledge base to generate robot control code. We further introduce a dataset of natural language mission descriptions to support development and benchmarking. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that LAN2CB enables robust and flexible multi-robot coordination from natural language, significantly reducing manual engineering effort and supporting broad generalization across diverse mission types.

In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors will result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and error terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the robot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN is a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used in any typical mobile robot application.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we present a lightweight deep learning-based hand gesture recognition system that enables humans to control collaborative robots naturally and efficiently. This model recognizes eight distinct hand gestures with only 1,103 parameters and a compact size of 22 KB, achieving an accuracy of 93.5%. To further optimize the model for real-world deployment on edge devices, we applied quantization and pruning using TensorFlow Lite, reducing the final model size to just 7 KB. The system was successfully implemented and tested on a Universal Robot UR5 collaborative robot within a real-time robotic framework based on ROS2. The results demonstrate that even extremely lightweight models can deliver accurate and responsive hand gesture-based control for collaborative robots, opening new possibilities for natural human-robot interaction in constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modular Robot and Landmark Localisation Using Relative Bearing Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18070v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we propose a modular nonlinear least squares filtering approach for systems composed of independent subsystems. The state and error covariance estimate of each subsystem is updated independently, even when a relative measurement simultaneously depends on the states of multiple subsystems. We integrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm as part of our solution in order to prevent double counting of information when subsystems share estimates with each other. An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least squares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the proposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem, noisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position measured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation problems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized simulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic joint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs. In this study we also include variants of the proposed method that achieve a graceful degradation of performance with reduced communication and bandwidth requirements.</p></details> | Submitted to RA-L |

In contrast, classical machine learning (ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged, allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities. In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Presentation at IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Robot Operation of Home Appliances by Reading User Manuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20424v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operating home appliances, among the most common tools in every household, is a critical capability for assistive home robots. This paper presents ApBot, a robot system that operates novel household appliances by "reading" their user manuals. ApBot faces multiple challenges: (i) infer goal-conditioned partial policies from their unstructured, textual descriptions in a user manual document, (ii) ground the policies to the appliance in the physical world, and (iii) execute the policies reliably over potentially many steps, despite compounding errors. To tackle these challenges, ApBot constructs a structured, symbolic model of an appliance from its manual, with the help of a large vision-language model (VLM). It grounds the symbolic actions visually to control panel elements. Finally, ApBot closes the loop by updating the model based on visual feedback. Our experiments show that across a wide range of simulated and real-world appliances, ApBot achieves consistent and statistically significant improvements in task success rate, compared with state-of-the-art large VLMs used directly as control policies. These results suggest that a structured internal representations plays an important role in robust robot operation of home appliances, especially, complex ones.</p></details> |  |

Robot learning, however, has thus far failed to replicate this success and remains constrained by a scarcity of available data. Learning from videos (LfV) methods aim to address this data bottleneck by augmenting traditional robot data with large-scale internet video. This video data provides foundational information regarding physical dynamics, behaviours, and tasks, and can be highly informative for general-purpose robots. This survey systematically examines the emerging field of LfV. We first outline essential concepts, including detailing fundamental LfV challenges such as distribution shift and missing action labels in video data. Next, we comprehensively review current methods for extracting knowledge from large-scale internet video, overcoming LfV challenges, and improving robot learning through video-informed training. The survey concludes with a critical discussion of future opportunities. Here, we emphasize the need for scalable foundation model approaches that can leverage the full range of available internet video and enhance the learning of robot policies and dynamics models. Overall, the survey aims to inform and catalyse future LfV research, driving progress towards general-purpose robots.</p></details> |  |

Robotic systems can improve and enrich the physical feedback provided to patients after neurological injury, but they under-utilize the adaptability and clinical expertise of trained therapists. In this position paper, we advocate for a novel approach that integrates the therapist's clinical expertise and nuanced decision-making with the strength, accuracy, and repeatability of robotics: Robot-mediated physical Human-Human Interaction. This framework, which enables two individuals to physically interact through robotic devices, has been studied across diverse research groups and has recently emerged as a promising link between conventional manual therapy and rehabilitation robotics, harmonizing the strengths of both approaches. This paper presents the rationale of a multidisciplinary team-including engineers, doctors, and physical therapists-for conducting research that utilizes: a unified taxonomy to describe robot-mediated rehabilitation, a framework of interaction based on social psychology, and a technological approach that makes robotic systems seamless facilitators of natural human-human interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Design and Control Methods for Using Collaborative Robots in Upper-Limb Rehabilitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18661v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the development of a robotic rehabilitation system for the upper limbs based on collaborative end-effector solutions. The use of commercial collaborative robots offers significant advantages for this task, as they are optimized from an engineering perspective and ensure safe physical interaction with humans. However, they also come with noticeable drawbacks, such as the limited range of sizes available on the market and the standard control modes, which are primarily oriented towards industrial or service applications. To address these limitations, we propose an optimization-based design method to fully exploit the capability of the cobot in performing rehabilitation tasks. Additionally, we introduce a novel control architecture based on an admittance-type Virtual Fixture method, which constrains the motion of the robot along a prescribed path. This approach allows for an intuitive definition of the task to be performed via Programming by Demonstration and enables the system to operate both passively and actively. In passive mode, the system supports the patient during task execution with additional force, while in active mode, it opposes the motion with a braking force. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[ERMV: Editing 4D Robotic Multi-view images to enhance embodied agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17462v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot imitation learning relies on 4D multi-view sequential images. However, the high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely constrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful strategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view sequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we propose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation framework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on single-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core challenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic views and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low computational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical objects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of innovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we introduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that learns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints. Second, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse Spatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views and remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the views to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation, we incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted expert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Exploratory Study on Human-Robot Interaction using Semantics-based Situational Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17376v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the impact of high-level semantics (evaluation of the environment) on Human-Robot Teams (HRT) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in the context of mobile robot deployments. Although semantics has been widely researched in AI, how high-level semantics can benefit the HRT paradigm is underexplored, often fuzzy, and intractable. We applied a semantics-based framework that could reveal different indicators of the environment (i.e. how much semantic information exists) in a mock-up disaster response mission. In such missions, semantics are crucial as the HRT should handle complex situations and respond quickly with correct decisions, where humans might have a high workload and stress. Especially when human operators need to shift their attention between robots and other tasks, they will struggle to build Situational Awareness (SA) quickly. The experiment suggests that the presented semantics: 1) alleviate the perceived workload of human operators; 2) increase the operator's trust in the SA; and 3) help to reduce the reaction time in switching the level of autonomy when needed. Additionally, we find that participants with higher trust in the system are encouraged by high-level semantics to use teleoperation mode more.</p></details> |  |

For this edge training, Microscaling (MX) data types offer a promising solution by combining integer and floating-point representations with shared exponents, reducing energy consumption while maintaining accuracy. However, the state-of-the-art continuous learning processor, namely Dacapo, faces limitations with its MXINT-only support and inefficient vector-based grouping during backpropagation. In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first work that addresses these limitations with two key innovations: (1) a precision-scalable arithmetic unit that supports all six MX data types by exploiting sub-word parallelism and unified integer and floating-point processing; and (2) support for square shared exponent groups to enable efficient weight handling during backpropagation, removing storage redundancy and quantization overhead. We evaluate our design against Dacapo under iso-peak-throughput on four robotics workloads in TSMC 16nm FinFET technology at 400MHz, reaching a 51% lower memory footprint, and 4x higher effective training throughput, while achieving comparable energy efficiency, enabling efficient robotics continual learning at the edge.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in 2025 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED 2025)</p></details> |

While recent progress in natural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots' ability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the procedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open environments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge, a hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It consists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation (IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA). RoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural skill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition and execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83% average success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world data samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards integrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems, offering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://abliao.github.io/RoBridge/</p></details> |

However, achieving effective coordination in distributed multi-agent environments remains challenging due to (1) misalignment between instructions and task requirements and (2) inconsistency in robot behaviors when they independently interpret ambiguous instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Instruction-Conditioned Coordinator (ICCO), a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework designed to enhance coordination in language-guided multi-robot systems. ICCO consists of a Coordinator agent and multiple Local Agents, where the Coordinator generates Task-Aligned and Consistent Instructions (TACI) by integrating language instructions with environmental states, ensuring task alignment and behavioral consistency. The Coordinator and Local Agents are jointly trained to optimize a reward function that balances task efficiency and instruction following. A Consistency Enhancement Term is added to the learning objective to maximize mutual information between instructions and robot behaviors, further improving coordination. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ICCO in achieving language-guided task-aligned multi-robot control.

TDR comprises multiple independently controlled robot segments, each with a set of driving tendons. While increasing the number of robot segments enhances dexterity and expands the workspace, this structural expansion also introduces intensified inter-segmental coupling. Therefore, achieving precise TDR control requires more complex models and additional motors. This paper presents a reconfigurable tendon-driven robot (RTR) equipped with innovative lockable joints. Each joint's state (locked/free) can be individually controlled through a pair of antagonistic tendons, and its structure eliminates the need for a continuous power supply to maintain the state. Operators can selectively actuate the targeted robot segments, and this scheme fundamentally eliminates the inter-segmental coupling, thereby avoiding the requirement for complex coordinated control between segments. The workspace of RTR has been simulated and compared with traditional TDRs' workspace, and RTR's advantages are further revealed. The kinematics and statics models of the RTR have been derived and validation experiments have been conducted. Demonstrations have been performed using a seven-joint RTR prototype to show its reconfigurability and moving ability in complex environments with an actuator pack comprising only six motors.</p></details> |  |

In order to ensure that construction robots can perform tasks efficiently and accurately in complex construction environments, traditional single-objective trajectory optimization methods are difficult to meet the complex requirements of the changing construction environment. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective trajectory optimization for the robotic arm used in the curtain wall installation. First, we design a robotic arm for curtain wall installation, integrating serial, parallel, and folding arm elements, while considering its physical properties and motion characteristics. In addition, this paper proposes an NSGA-III-FO algorithm (NSGA-III with Focused Operator, NSGA-III-FO) that incorporates a focus operator screening mechanism to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm towards the Pareto front, thereby effectively balancing the multi-objective constraints of construction robots. The proposed algorithm is tested against NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and MSOPS-II in ten consecutive trials on the DTLZ3 and WFG3 test functions, showing significantly better convergence efficiency than the other algorithms. Finally, we conduct two sets of experiments on the designed robotic arm platform, which confirm the efficiency and practicality of the NSGA-III-FO algorithm in solving multi-objective trajectory planning problems for curtain wall installation tasks.</p></details> |  |

We design a hydraulically driven robotic arm for curtain wall installation and a dynamic parameter identification method. We establish a Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) model based on measured robotic arm structural parameters and integrate hydraulic cylinder dynamics to construct a composite parametric system driven by a Stribeck friction model. By designing high-signal-to-noise ratio displacement excitation signals for hydraulic cylinders and combining Fourier series to construct optimal excitation trajectories that satisfy joint constraints, this method effectively excites the characteristics of each parameter in the minimal parameter set of the dynamic model of the robotic arm. On this basis, a hierarchical progressive parameter identification strategy is proposed: least squares estimation is employed to separately identify and jointly calibrate the dynamic parameters of both the hydraulic cylinder and the robotic arm, yielding Stribeck model curves for each joint. Experimental validation on a robotic arm platform demonstrates residual standard deviations below 0.4 Nm between theoretical and measured joint torques, confirming high-precision dynamic parameter identification for the hydraulic-driven curtain wall installation robotic arm. This significantly contributes to enhancing the intelligence level of curtain wall installation operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Modeling and Dimensional Optimization of Legged Mechanisms for Construction Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17132v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of the construction industry, issues such as harsh working environments, high-intensity and high-risk tasks, and labor shortages have become increasingly prominent. This drives higher demands for construction robots in terms of low energy consumption, high mobility, and high load capacity. This paper focuses on the design and optimization of leg structures for construction robots, aiming to improve their dynamic performance, reduce energy consumption, and enhance load-bearing capabilities. Firstly, based on the leg configuration of ants in nature, we design a structure for the robot's leg. Secondly, we propose a novel structural optimization method. Using the Lagrangian approach, a dynamic model of the leg was established. Combining the dynamic model with the leg's motion trajectory, we formulated multiple dynamic evaluation metrics and conducted a comprehensive optimization study on the geometric parameters of each leg segment. The results show that the optimized leg structure reduces peak joint torques and energy consumption by over 20%. Finally, dynamic simulation experiments were conducted using ADAMS. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in the driving power of each joint after optimization, validating the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed strategy. This study provides a theoretical foundation and technical support for the design of heavy-load, high-performance construction robots.</p></details> |  |

The method extracts the 2D ellipse center from the image and the 3D sphere center from the pointcloud, which are then paired to compute the transformation matrix. Specifically, the image is first decomposed using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Then, a novel algorithm extracts an ellipse from a potentially corrupted sphere, and the extracted center of ellipse is corrected for errors caused by the perspective projection model. For the LiDAR pointcloud, points on the sphere tend to be highly noisy due to the absence of flat regions. To accurately extract the sphere from these noisy measurements, we apply a hierarchical weighted sum to the accumulated pointcloud. Through experiments, we demonstrated that the sphere can be robustly detected even under both types of corruption, outperforming other targets. We evaluated our method using three different types of LiDARs (spinning, solid-state, and non-repetitive) with cameras positioned in three different locations. Furthermore, we validated the robustness of our method to target corruption by experimenting with spheres subjected to various types of degradation. These experiments were conducted in both a planetary test and a field environment. Our code is available at https://github.com/sparolab/MARSCalib.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

Recently, significant progress has been made to advance this field. These kinds of models are typically evaluated through task success rates, which fail to capture the quality of task execution and the mode's confidence in its decisions. In this paper, we propose eight uncertainty metrics and five quality metrics specifically designed for VLA models for robotic manipulation tasks. We assess their effectiveness through a large-scale empirical study involving 908 successful task executions from three state-of-the-art VLA models across four representative robotic manipulation tasks. Human domain experts manually labeled task quality, allowing us to analyze the correlation between our proposed metrics and expert judgments. The results reveal that several metrics show moderate to strong correlation with human assessments, highlighting their utility for evaluating task quality and model confidence. Furthermore, we found that some of the metrics can discriminate between high-, medium-, and low-quality executions from unsuccessful tasks, which can be interesting when test oracles are not available. Our findings challenge the adequacy of current evaluation practices that rely solely on binary success rates and pave the way for improved real-time monitoring and adaptive enhancement of VLA-enabled robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current systems often separate map exploration and path planning, with exploration relying on inefficient algorithms due to limited (partially observed) environmental information. In this paper, we present a novel navigation pipeline named "VL-Explore" for simultaneous exploration and target discovery in unknown environments, leveraging the capabilities of a vision-language model named CLIP. Our approach requires only monocular vision and operates without any prior map or knowledge about the target. For comprehensive evaluations, we designed a functional prototype of a UGV (unmanned ground vehicle) system named "Open Rover", a customized platform for general-purpose VLN tasks. We integrated and deployed the VL-Explore pipeline on Open Rover to evaluate its throughput, obstacle avoidance capability, and trajectory performance across various real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VL-Explore consistently outperforms traditional map-traversal algorithms and achieves performance comparable to path-planning methods that depend on prior map and target knowledge. Notably, VL-Explore offers real-time active navigation without requiring pre-captured candidate images or pre-built node graphs, addressing key limitations of existing VLN pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2, i...</summary><p>V2, includes suppl as appendix</p></details> |

This research introduces RAPTAR (Radiation Pattern Acquisition through Robotic Automation), a portable, state-of-the-art, and autonomous system based on collaborative robotics. RAPTAR enables 3D radiation-pattern measurement of integrated radar modules without dedicated anechoic facilities. The system is designed to address the challenges of testing radar modules mounted in diverse real-world configurations, including vehicles, UAVs, AR/VR headsets, and biomedical devices, where traditional measurement setups are impractical. A 7-degree-of-freedom Franka cobot holds the receiver probe and performs collision-free manipulation across a hemispherical spatial domain, guided by real-time motion planning and calibration accuracy with RMS error below 0.9 mm. The system achieves an angular resolution upto 2.5 degree and integrates seamlessly with RF instrumentation for near- and far-field power measurements. Experimental scans of a 60 GHz radar module show a mean absolute error of less than 2 dB compared to full-wave electromagnetic simulations ground truth. Benchmarking against baseline method demonstrates 36.5% lower mean absolute error, highlighting RAPTAR accuracy and repeatability.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, IEEE Journal</p></details> |

Using software-in-the-loop (SIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL), an RL-trained artificial intelligence (AI) controller is developed using a digital twin (DT) in simulation and subsequently verified in physical experiments. An underwater motion capture (MOCAP) system provides real-time 3D position and orientation feedback during verification testing for precise synchronization between the digital and physical domains. A key novelty of this approach is the combined use of a general-purpose game engine for simulation, deep RL, and real-time underwater motion capture for an effective zero-shot sim-to-real strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Automate This? Exploring Correlations between Desire for Robotic Automation, Invested Time and Well-Being](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06348v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the motivations underlying the human inclination to automate tasks is vital to developing truly helpful robots integrated into daily life. Accordingly, we ask: are individuals more inclined to automate chores based on the time they consume or the feelings experienced while performing them? This study explores these preferences and whether they vary across different social groups (i.e., gender category and income level). Leveraging data from the BEHAVIOR-1K dataset, the American Time-Use Survey, and the American Time-Use Survey Well-Being Module, we investigate the relationship between the desire for automation, time spent on daily activities, and their associated feelings - Happiness, Meaningfulness, Sadness, Painfulness, Stressfulness, or Tiredness. Our key findings show that, despite common assumptions, time spent does not strongly relate to the desire for automation for the general population. For the feelings analyzed, only happiness and pain are key indicators. Significant differences by gender and economic level also emerged: Women prefer to automate stressful activities, whereas men prefer to automate those that make them unhappy; mid-income individuals prioritize automating less enjoyable and meaningful activities, while low and high-income show no significant correlations. We hope our research helps motivate technologies to develop robots that match the priorities of potential users, moving domestic robotics toward more socially relevant solutions. We open-source all the data, including an online tool that enables the community to replicate our analysis and explore additional trends at https://robin-lab.cs.utexas.edu/why-automate-this/.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, grounding VLMs, originally trained on internet data, to diverse real-world robots remains a challenge. This paper presents ExpTeach, a framework that grounds VLMs to physical robots by building a self-generated memory of real-world experiences. In ExpTeach, the VLM autonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts robot behaviors in a closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this process are then summarized into a long-term memory, enabling retrieval of learned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, ExpTeach enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with an on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection improves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and observe the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative tool use. Across extensive tests on 12 real-world scenarios (including eight unseen ones), we find that grounding with long-term memory boosts single-trial success rates from 22% to 80%, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of ExpTeach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Ladder Climbing with a Quadrupedal Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17731v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadruped robots are proliferating in industrial environments where they carry sensor payloads and serve as autonomous inspection platforms. Despite the advantages of legged robots over their wheeled counterparts on rough and uneven terrain, they are still unable to reliably negotiate a ubiquitous feature of industrial infrastructure: ladders. Inability to traverse ladders prevents quadrupeds from inspecting dangerous locations, puts humans in harm's way, and reduces industrial site productivity. In this paper, we learn quadrupedal ladder climbing via a reinforcement learning-based control policy and a complementary hooked end effector. We evaluate the robustness in simulation across different ladder inclinations, rung geometries, and inter-rung spacings. On hardware, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer with an overall 90% success rate at ladder angles ranging from 70{\deg} to 90{\deg}, consistent climbing performance during unmodeled perturbations, and climbing speeds 232x faster than the state of the art. This work expands the scope of industrial quadruped robot applications beyond inspection on nominal terrains to challenging infrastructural features in the environment, highlighting synergies between robot morphology and control policy when performing complex skills.

| **[Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Models-based Anomaly Detection for under-constrained Cable-Driven Parallel Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07714v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive, unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions. Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4% average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Guided Reinforcement Learning for Omnidirectional 3D Jumping in Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16481v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jumping poses a significant challenge for quadruped robots, despite being crucial for many operational scenarios. While optimisation methods exist for controlling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive knowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in real-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable alternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of sample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and predictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the safety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages physical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining B\'ezier curves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Designing for Difference: How Human Characteristics Shape Perceptions of Collaborative Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16480v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of assistive robots for social collaboration raises critical questions about responsible and inclusive design, especially when interacting with individuals from protected groups such as those with disabilities or advanced age. Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying robot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since participants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots. In the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that enable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support meaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112 participants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos from a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The experimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise on human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM reflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more pronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human condition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences the assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest, while collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations. Scenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those without them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and interaction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative robots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight the potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback, supporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic systems tailored to diverse populations.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI or Human? Understanding Perceptions of Embodied Robots with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16398v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of artificial intelligence has long been associated to the the challenge of effectively measuring intelligence. Even if the Turing Test was introduced as a means of assessing a system intelligence, its relevance and application within the field of human-robot interaction remain largely underexplored. This study investigates the perception of intelligence in embodied robots by performing a Turing Test within a robotic platform. A total of 34 participants were tasked with distinguishing between AI- and human-operated robots while engaging in two interactive tasks: an information retrieval and a package handover. These tasks assessed the robot perception and navigation abilities under both static and dynamic conditions. Results indicate that participants were unable to reliably differentiate between AI- and human-controlled robots beyond chance levels. Furthermore, analysis of participant responses reveals key factors influencing the perception of artificial versus human intelligence in embodied robotic systems. These findings provide insights into the design of future interactive robots and contribute to the ongoing discourse on intelligence assessment in AI-driven systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Humanoid Robot Whole-body Geometric Calibration with Embedded Sensors and a Single Plane](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16369v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-body geometric calibration of humanoid robots using classical robot calibration methods is a timeconsuming and experimentally burdensome task. However, despite its significance for accurate control and simulation, it is often overlooked in the humanoid robotics community. To address this issue, we propose a novel practical method that utilizes a single plane, embedded force sensors, and an admittance controller to calibrate the whole-body kinematics of humanoids without requiring manual intervention. Given the complexity of humanoid robots, it is crucial to generate and determine a minimal set of optimal calibration postures. To do so, we propose a new algorithm called IROC (Information Ranking algorithm for selecting Optimal Calibration postures). IROC requires a pool of feasible candidate postures to build a normalized weighted information matrix for each posture. Then, contrary to other algorithms from the literature, IROC will determine the minimal number of optimal postures that are to be played onto a robot for its calibration. Both IROC and the single-plane calibration method were experimentally validated on a TALOS humanoid robot. The total whole-body kinematics chain was calibrated using solely 31 optimal postures with 3-point contacts on a table by the robot gripper. In a cross-validation experiment, the average root-mean-square (RMS) error was reduced by a factor of 2.3 compared to the manufacturer's model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology Optimization of Leg Structures for Construction Robots Based on Variable Density Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16335v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex terrain construction environments, there are high demands for robots to achieve both high payload capacity and mobility flexibility. As the key load-bearing component, the optimization of robotic leg structures is of particular importance. Therefore, this study focuses on the optimization of leg structures for construction robots, proposing a topology optimization strategy based on the SIMP (Solid Isotropic Microstructures with Penalization) variable density method along with a structural re-design approach. The design performance is comprehensively validated through finite element analysis using ANSYS. First, static and modal analyses are conducted to evaluate the rationality of the initial design. Then, topology optimization using the SIMP-based variable density method is applied to the femur section, which accounts for the largest proportion of the leg's weight. Based on iterative calculations, the femur undergoes secondary structural reconstruction. After optimization, the mass of the femur is reduced by 19.45\%, and the overall leg mass decreases by 7.92\%, achieving the goal of lightweight design. Finally, static and modal analyses are conducted on the reconstructed leg. The results demonstrate that the optimized leg still meets structural performance requirements, validating the feasibility of lightweight design. This research provides robust theoretical and technical support for lightweight construction robot design and lays a foundation for their efficient operation in complex construction environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design and Dimensional Optimization of Legged Structures for Construction Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16328v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Faced with complex and unstructured construction environments, wheeled and tracked robots exhibit significant limitations in terrain adaptability and flexibility, making it difficult to meet the requirements of autonomous operation. Inspired by ants in nature, this paper proposes a leg configuration design and optimization method tailored for construction scenarios, aiming to enhance the autonomous mobility of construction robots. This paper analyzes the full operational motion performance of the leg during both swing and stance phases. First, based on kinematic modeling and multi-dimensional workspace analysis, the concept of an "improved workspace" is introduced, and graphical methods are used to optimize the leg dimensions during the swing phase. Furthermore, a new concept of "average manipulability" is introduced based on the velocity Jacobian matrix, and numerical solutions are applied to obtain the leg segment ratio that maximizes manipulability. To overcome the difficulties associated with traditional analytical methods, virtual prototype simulations are conducted in ADAMS to explore the relationship between the robot body's optimal flexibility and leg segment proportions. In summary, the leg segment proportions with the best comprehensive motion performance are obtained. This study presents the first multi-dimensional quantitative evaluation framework for leg motion performance tailored for construction environments, providing a structural design foundation for legged construction robots to achieve autonomous mobility in complex terrains.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, our study innovatively draws inspiration from the mechanics of human upper limb movements during weight lifting, proposing a bio-inspired trajectory planning framework that incorporates human energy conversion principles. By collecting motion trajectories and electromyography (EMG) signals during dumbbell curls, we construct an anthropomorphic trajectory planning that integrates human force exertion patterns and energy consumption patterns. Utilizing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, we achieve dynamic load distribution for robotic arm trajectory planning based on human-like movement features. In practical application, these bio-inspired movement characteristics are applied to curtain wall installation tasks, validating the correctness and superiority of our trajectory planning method. Simulation results demonstrate a 48.4% reduction in energy consumption through intelligent conversion between kinetic and potential energy. This approach provides new insights and theoretical support for optimizing energy use in curtain wall installation robots during actual handling tasks.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry, inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments. The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on collected legged robots and open-source datasets.

In this work, we propose a scalable way to probe this question by generating a benchmark spanning the key moments in 824 major pieces of science fiction literature (movies, tv, novels and scientific books) where an agent (AI or robot) made critical decisions (good or bad). We use a state-of-the-art LLM's recollection of each key moment to generate questions in similar situations, the decisions made by the agent, and alternative decisions it could have made (good or bad). We then measure an approximation of how well models align with human values on a set of human-voted answers. We also generate rules that can be automatically improved via an amendment process in order to generate the first Sci-Fi inspired constitutions for promoting ethical behavior in AIs and robots in the real world. Our first finding is that modern LLMs paired with constitutions turn out to be well-aligned with human values (95.8%), contrary to unsettling decisions typically made in Sci-Fi (only 21.2% alignment). Secondly, we find that generated constitutions substantially increase alignment compared to the base model (79.4% to 95.8%), and show resilience to an adversarial prompt setting (23.3% to 92.3%). Additionally, we find that those constitutions are among the top performers on the ASIMOV Benchmark which is derived from real-world images and hospital injury reports. Sci-Fi-inspired constitutions are thus highly aligned and applicable in real-world situations. We release SciFi-Benchmark: a large-scale dataset to advance robot ethics and safety research. It comprises 9,056 questions and 53,384 answers generated through a novel LLM-introspection process, in addition to a smaller human-labeled evaluation set.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor improvements over previous version</p></details> |

We study the problem of adapting on-the-fly to such novel scenarios during deployment, by drawing upon a diverse repertoire of previouslylearned behaviors. Our approach, RObust Autonomous Modulation (ROAM), introduces a mechanism based on the perceived value of pre-trained behaviors to select and adapt pre-trained behaviors to the situation at hand. Crucially, this adaptation process all happens within a single episode at test time, without any human supervision. We demonstrate that ROAM enables a robot to adapt rapidly to changes in dynamics both in simulation and on a real Go1 quadruped, even successfully moving forward with roller skates on its feet. Our approach adapts over 2x as efficiently compared to existing methods when facing a variety of out-of-distribution situations during deployment by effectively choosing and adapting relevant behaviors on-the-fly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking LLM Privacy Recognition for Social Robot Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16124v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social robots are embodied agents that interact with people while following human communication norms. These robots interact using verbal and non-verbal cues, and share the physical environments of people. While social robots have previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to develop LLM-empowered social robots for enhanced human-robot interaction. To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within home environments. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks, evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the context of household social robots. In this study, we present a set of privacy-relevant scenarios crafted through the lens of Contextual Integrity (CI). We first survey users' privacy preferences regarding in-home social robot behaviors and then examine how their privacy orientation affects their choices of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provide the same set of scenarios and questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and find that the agreement between humans and LLMs is low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as a potential privacy controller, we implement four additional prompting strategies and compare their results. Finally, we discuss the implications and potential of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both efficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image processing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both human head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA robot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as well as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions of interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction from human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide foveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space, allowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces computational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks and robustness to unseen distractors. Together, these findings suggest that human-inspired visual processing offers a useful inductive bias for robotic vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

In this paper, we propose a unicycle-based ESC design applicable to differential wheeled robots that: (1) is very simple design, based on one simple control-affine law, and without state integrators; (2) attenuates oscillations known to persist in ESC designs (i.e., fully stop at the source); and (3) operates in a model-free, real-time setting, tolerating environmental/sensor noise. We provide simulation and real-world robotic experimental results for fixed and moving light source seeking by a differential wheeled robot using our proposed design. Results indicate clear advantages of our proposed design when compared to the literature, including attenuation of undesired oscillations, improved convergence speed, and better handling of noise.</p></details> |  |

Existing HRI systems demonstrate great progress in interpreting and following user instructions, action generation, and robot task solving. On the other hand, bi-directional, multi-modal, and context-aware support of the user in collaborative tasks still remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present a gaze- and speech-informed interface to the assistive robot, which is able to perceive the working environment from multiple vision inputs and support the dynamic user in their tasks. Our system is designed to be modular and transferable to adapt to diverse tasks and robots, and it is capable of real-time use of language-based interaction state representation and fast on board perception modules. Its development was supported by multiple public dissemination events, contributing important considerations for improved robustness and user experience. Furthermore, in two lab studies, we compare the performance and user ratings of our system with those of a traditional scripted HRI pipeline. Our findings indicate that an LLM-based approach enhances adaptability and marginally improves user engagement and task execution metrics but may produce redundant output, while a scripted pipeline is well suited for more straightforward tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the 34th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN), which will be held in Eindhoven, Netherlands on August 25-29, 2025.

As an accessible robot for broad applications across classroom education to AI experiments, Forte pushes forward the performance limitations of existing low-cost educational arms. We introduce a cost-effective mechanical design that combines capstan-based cable drives, timing belts, simple tensioning mechanisms, and lightweight 3D-printed structures, along with topology optimization for structural stiffness. Through careful drivetrain engineering, we minimize backlash and maintain control fidelity without relying on high-power electronics or expensive manufacturing processes. Experimental validation demonstrates that Forte achieves high repeatability and load capacity, offering a compelling robotic platform for both classroom instruction and advanced robotics research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven MPC with Data Selection for Flexible Cable-Driven Robotic Arms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15677v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flexible cable-driven robotic arms (FCRAs) offer dexterous and compliant motion. Still, the inherent properties of cables, such as resilience, hysteresis, and friction, often lead to particular difficulties in modeling and control. This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) method that relies exclusively on input-output data, without a physical model, to improve the control accuracy of FCRAs. First, we develop an implicit model based on input-output data and integrate it into an MPC optimization framework. Second, a data selection algorithm (DSA) is introduced to filter the data that best characterize the system, thereby reducing the solution time per step to approximately 4 ms, which is an improvement of nearly 80%. Lastly, the influence of hyperparameters on tracking error is investigated through simulation. The proposed method has been validated on a real FCRA platform, including five-point positioning accuracy tests, a five-point response tracking test, and trajectory tracking for letter drawing. The results demonstrate that the average positioning accuracy is approximately 2.070 mm. Moreover, compared to the PID method with an average tracking error of 1.418{\deg}, the proposed method achieves an average tracking error of 0.541{\deg}.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMP: Executable Motion Prior for Humanoid Robot Standing Upper-body Motion Imitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15649v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support humanoid robots in performing manipulation tasks, it is essential to study stable standing while accommodating upper-body motions. However, the limited controllable range of humanoid robots in a standing position affects the stability of the entire body. Thus we introduce a reinforcement learning based framework for humanoid robots to imitate human upper-body motions while maintaining overall stability. Our approach begins with designing a retargeting network that generates a large-scale upper-body motion dataset for training the reinforcement learning (RL) policy, which enables the humanoid robot to track upper-body motion targets, employing domain randomization for enhanced robustness. To avoid exceeding the robot's execution capability and ensure safety and stability, we propose an Executable Motion Prior (EMP) module, which adjusts the input target movements based on the robot's current state. This adjustment improves standing stability while minimizing changes to motion amplitude. We evaluate our framework through simulation and real-world tests, demonstrating its practical applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[FollowUpBot: An LLM-Based Conversational Robot for Automatic Postoperative Follow-up](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15502v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Postoperative follow-up plays a crucial role in monitoring recovery and identifying complications. However, traditional approaches, typically involving bedside interviews and manual documentation, are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing digital solutions, such as web questionnaires and intelligent automated calls, can alleviate the workload of nurses to a certain extent, they either deliver an inflexible scripted interaction or face private information leakage issues. To address these limitations, this paper introduces FollowUpBot, an LLM-powered edge-deployed robot for postoperative care and monitoring. It allows dynamic planning of optimal routes and uses edge-deployed LLMs to conduct adaptive and face-to-face conversations with patients through multiple interaction modes, ensuring data privacy. Moreover, FollowUpBot is capable of automatically generating structured postoperative follow-up reports for healthcare institutions by analyzing patient interactions during follow-up. Experimental results demonstrate that our robot achieves high coverage and satisfaction in follow-up interactions, as well as high report generation accuracy across diverse field types.

| **[Robots for Kiwifruit Harvesting and Pollination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15484v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research was a part of a project that developed mobile robots that performed targeted pollen spraying and automated harvesting in pergola structured kiwifruit orchards. Multiple kiwifruit detachment mechanisms were designed and field testing of one of the concepts showed that the mechanism could reliably pick kiwifruit. Furthermore, this kiwifruit detachment mechanism was able to reach over 80 percent of fruit in the cluttered kiwifruit canopy, whereas the previous state of the art mechanism was only able to reach less than 70 percent of the fruit. Artificial pollination was performed by detecting flowers and then spraying pollen in solution onto the detected flowers from a line of sprayers on a boom, while driving at up to 1.4 ms-1. In addition, the height of the canopy was measured and the spray boom was moved up and down to keep the boom close enough to the flowers for the spray to reach the flowers, while minimising collisions with the canopy. Mobile robot navigation was performed using a 2D lidar in apple orchards and vineyards. Lidar navigation in kiwifruit orchards was more challenging because the pergola structure only provides a small amount of data for the direction of rows, compared to the amount of data from the overhead canopy, the undulating ground and other objects in the orchards. Multiple methods are presented here for extracting structure defining features from 3D lidar data in kiwifruit orchards. In addition, a 3D lidar navigation system -- which performed row following, row end detection and row end turns -- was tested for over 30 km of autonomous driving in kiwifruit orchards. Computer vision algorithms for row detection and row following were also tested. The computer vision algorithm worked as well as the 3D lidar row following method in testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Six-DoF Hand-Based Teleoperation for Omnidirectional Aerial Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15009v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnidirectional aerial robots offer full 6-DoF independent control over position and orientation, making them popular for aerial manipulation. Although advancements in robotic autonomy, human operation remains essential in complex aerial environments. Existing teleoperation approaches for multirotors fail to fully leverage the additional DoFs provided by omnidirectional rotation. Additionally, the dexterity of human fingers should be exploited for more engaged interaction. In this work, we propose an aerial teleoperation system that brings the rotational flexibility of human hands into the unbounded aerial workspace. Our system includes two motion-tracking marker sets--one on the shoulder and one on the hand--along with a data glove to capture hand gestures. Using these inputs, we design four interaction modes for different tasks, including Spherical Mode and Cartesian Mode for long-range moving, Operation Mode for precise manipulation, as well as Locking Mode for temporary pauses, where the hand gestures are utilized for seamless mode switching. We evaluate our system on a vertically mounted valve-turning task in the real world, demonstrating how each mode contributes to effective aerial manipulation. This interaction framework bridges human dexterity with aerial robotics, paving the way for enhanced aerial teleoperation in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 10 figures.

Prior work has explored self-reflection in Large Language Models (LLMs) for task planning error correction; however, existing methods are constrained by inflexible self-reflection mechanisms that limit their effectiveness. Motivated by these limitations and inspired by human cognitive adaptation, we propose the Flexible Constructivism Reflection Framework (FCRF), a novel Mentor-Actor architecture that enables LLMs to perform flexible self-reflection based on task difficulty, while constructively integrating historical valuable experience with failure lessons. We evaluated FCRF on diverse domestic tasks through simulation in AlfWorld and physical deployment in the real-world environment. Experimental results demonstrate that FCRF significantly improves overall performance and self-reflection flexibility in complex long-horizon robotic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, IROS 2025</p></details> |

These settings are often characterized by high levels of bureaucracy, risk avoidance, and restricted autonomy. Patients frequently experience a profound loss of control over their lives, leading to heightened psychological stress-sometimes resulting in isolation as a safety measure. In this study, we explore how co-design can be used to collaboratively develop a companion robot that helps monitor and regulate stress while maintaining tracking of the patients' interaction behaviours for long-term intervention. We conducted four co-design workshops in a forensic psychiatric clinic with patients, caregivers, and therapists. Our process began with the presentation of an initial speculative prototype to therapists, enabling reflection on shared concerns, ethical risks, and desirable features. This was followed by a creative ideation session with patients, a third workshop focused on defining desired functions and emotional responses, and we are planning a final prototype demo to gather direct patient feedback. Our findings emphasize the importance of empowering patients in the design process and adapting proposals based on their current emotional state. The goal was to empower the patient in the design process and ensure each patient's voice was heard.</p></details> |  |

Adaptive Robot Task Planning in Human-Robot Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01483v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive task planning is fundamental to ensuring effective and seamless human-robot collaboration. This paper introduces a robot task planning framework that takes into account both human leading/following preferences and performance, specifically focusing on task allocation and scheduling in collaborative settings. We present a proactive task allocation approach with three primary objectives: enhancing team performance, incorporating human preferences, and upholding a positive human perception of the robot and the collaborative experience. Through a user study, involving an autonomous mobile manipulator robot working alongside participants in a collaborative scenario, we confirm that the task planning framework successfully attains all three intended goals, thereby contributing to the advancement of adaptive task planning in human-robot collaboration. This paper mainly focuses on the first two objectives, and we discuss the third objective, participants' perception of the robot, tasks, and collaboration in a companion paper.</p></details> |  |

Language driven robotic grasping (LDRG) predicts stable grasp poses from natural language queries and RGB-D images. We propose MapleGrasp, a novel framework that leverages mask-guided feature pooling for efficient vision-language driven grasping. Our two-stage training first predicts segmentation masks from CLIP-based vision-language features. The second stage pools features within these masks to generate pixel-level grasp predictions, improving efficiency, and reducing computation. Incorporating mask pooling results in a 7% improvement over prior approaches on the OCID-VLG benchmark. Furthermore, we introduce RefGraspNet, an open-source dataset eight times larger than existing alternatives, significantly enhancing model generalization for open-vocabulary grasping. MapleGrasp scores a strong grasping accuracy of 89\% when compared with competing methods in the RefGraspNet benchmark. Our method achieves comparable performance to larger Vision-Language-Action models on the LIBERO benchmark, and shows significantly better generalization to unseen tasks. Real-world experiments on a Franka arm demonstrate 73% success rate with unseen objects, surpassing competitive baselines by 11%. Code will be released after publication.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce X-Nav, a novel framework for end-to-end cross-embodiment navigation where a single unified policy can be deployed across various embodiments for both wheeled and quadrupedal robots. X-Nav consists of two learning stages: 1) multiple expert policies are trained using deep reinforcement learning with privileged observations on a wide range of randomly generated robot embodiments; and 2) a single general policy is distilled from the expert policies via navigation action chunking with transformer (Nav-ACT). The general policy directly maps visual and proprioceptive observations to low-level control commands, enabling generalization to novel robot embodiments. Simulated experiments demonstrated that X-Nav achieved zero-shot transfer to both unseen embodiments and photorealistic environments. A scalability study showed that the performance of X-Nav improves when trained with an increasing number of randomly generated embodiments. An ablation study confirmed the design choices of X-Nav. Furthermore, real-world experiments were conducted to validate the generalizability of X-Nav in real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

Enhancing autonomy on the Gateway presents several unique challenges, one of which is to equip the Canadarm3, the Gateway's external robotic system, with the capability to perform worksite monitoring. Monitoring will involve using the arm's inspection cameras to detect any anomalies within the operating environment, a task complicated by the widely-varying lighting conditions in space. In this paper, we introduce the visual anomaly detection and localization task for space applications and establish a benchmark with our novel synthetic dataset called ALLO (for Anomaly Localization in Lunar Orbit). We develop a complete data generation pipeline to create ALLO, which we use to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art visual anomaly detection algorithms. Given the low tolerance for risk during space operations and the lack of relevant data, we emphasize the need for novel, robust, and accurate anomaly detection methods to handle the challenging visual conditions found in lunar orbit and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA'25), Atlanta, USA, May 19-23, 2025</p></details> |

The proposed framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. The framework supports real-time, decentralized operation onboard the robots and has been integrated with three types of aerial and ground platforms. We validate its effectiveness through experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments, as well as benchmarks on public datasets and comparisons with existing methods. The framework is open-sourced and suitable for both single-agent and multi-robot real-time metric-semantic SLAM applications.

| **[BT-TL-DMPs: A Novel Robot TAMP Framework Combining Behavior Tree, Temporal Logic and Dynamical Movement Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14582v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of Learning from Demonstration (LfD), enabling robots to generalize learned manipulation skills to novel scenarios for long-horizon tasks remains challenging. Specifically, it is still difficult for robots to adapt the learned skills to new environments with different task and motion requirements, especially in long-horizon, multi-stage scenarios with intricate constraints. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical framework, called BT-TL-DMPs, that integrates Behavior Tree (BT), Temporal Logic (TL), and Dynamical Movement Primitives (DMPs) to address this problem. Within this framework, Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is employed to formally specify complex, long-horizon task requirements and constraints. These STL specifications are systematically transformed to generate reactive and modular BTs for high-level decision-making task structure. An STL-constrained DMP optimization method is proposed to optimize the DMP forcing term, allowing the learned motion primitives to adapt flexibly while satisfying intricate spatiotemporal requirements and, crucially, preserving the essential dynamics learned from demonstrations. The framework is validated through simulations demonstrating generalization capabilities under various STL constraints and real-world experiments on several long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively bridges the symbolic-motion gap, enabling more reliable and generalizable autonomous manipulation for complex robotic tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

However, prior studies have found that existing dialogue pipelines for SARs remain limited in real-time latency, back-channeling, and personalized speech dialogue. Toward addressing these limitations, we propose using integrated end-to-end speech-language models (SLMs) with SARs. This work 1) evaluated the usability of an SLM-enabled SAR dialogue system through a small user study, and 2) identified remaining limitations through study user feedback to inform future improvements. We conducted a small within-participant user study with university students (N = 11) whose results showed that participants perceived an SLM-enabled SAR system as capable of providing empathetic feedback, natural turn-taking, back-channeling, and adaptive responses. We also found that participants reported the robot's nonverbal behaviors as lacking variability and synchronization with conversation, and the SLM's verbal feedback as generic and repetitive. These findings highlighted the need for real-time robot movement synchronized with conversation, improved prompting or fine-tuning to generate outputs better aligned with mental health practices, and more expressive, adaptive vocal generation.</p></details> |  |

As a result, we are seeing similar advancements in embodied AI and robotics for control policy generation. Our review paper examines the integration of generative AI models with RL to advance robotics. Our primary focus is on the duality between generative AI and RL for robotics downstream tasks. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The role of prominent generative AI tools as modular priors for multi-modal input fusion in RL tasks. (2) How RL can train, fine-tune and distill generative models for policy generation, such as VLA models, similarly to RL applications in large language models. We then propose a new taxonomy based on a considerable amount of selected papers. Lastly, we identify open challenges accounting for model scalability, adaptation and grounding, giving recommendations and insights on future research directions. We reflect on which generative AI models best fit the RL tasks and why. On the other side, we reflect on important issues inherent to RL-enhanced generative policies, such as safety concerns and failure modes, and what are the limitations of current methods.

Most robotic systems today treat their physical form as a fixed constraint rather than an adaptive resource, forcing the same rigid geometric representation to serve applications with vastly different computational and precision requirements. We introduce MorphIt, a novel algorithm for approximating robot morphology using spherical primitives that balances geometric accuracy with computational efficiency. Unlike existing approaches that rely on either labor-intensive manual specification or inflexible computational methods, MorphIt implements an automatic gradient-based optimization framework with tunable parameters that provides explicit control over the physical fidelity versus computational cost tradeoff. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that MorphIt outperforms baseline approaches (Variational Sphere Set Approximation and Adaptive Medial-Axis Approximation) across multiple metrics, achieving better mesh approximation with fewer spheres and reduced computational overhead. Our experiments show enhanced robot capabilities in collision detection accuracy, contact-rich interaction simulation, and navigation through confined spaces. By dynamically adapting geometric representations to task requirements, robots can now exploit their physical embodiment as an active resource rather than an inflexible parameter, opening new frontiers for manipulation in environments where physical form must continuously balance precision with computational tractability.</p></details> |  |

The STARFAB project aims to create a ground demonstration of an orbital automated warehouse as a hub for sustainable commercial operations and servicing. A critical part of this fully-autonomous robotic facility will be the capability to monitor, inspect, and assess the condition of both the components stored in the warehouse, and the STARFAB facility itself. This paper introduces ongoing work on the STARFAB Mobile Inspection Module (MIM). The MIM uses Standard Interconnects (SI) so that it can be carried by Walking Manipulators (WM) as an independently-mobile robot, and multiple MIMs can be stored and retrieved as needed for operations on STARFAB. The MIM carries high-resolution cameras, a 3D profilometer, and a thermal imaging sensor, with the capability to add other modular sensors. A grasping tool and torque wrench are stored within the modular body for use by an attached WM for maintenance operations. Implementation and testing is still ongoing at the time of writing.

Deep neural networks have shown remarkable success in grasp synthesis by learning rich and abstract representations of objects. When deployed at the edge, these models can enable low-latency, low-power inference, making real-time grasping feasible in resource-constrained environments.
