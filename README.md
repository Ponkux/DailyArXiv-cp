| **[Vision-and-Language Navigation with Analogical Textual Descriptions in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25139v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions. We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in navigation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02912v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end, with agents generating messages and actions concurrently. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), to simulate future states. Agents then communicate a summary of this plan. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

| **[PoseDiff: A Unified Diffusion Model Bridging Robot Pose Estimation and Video-to-Action Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24591v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI.

| **[CORE-3D: Context-aware Open-vocabulary Retrieval by Embeddings in 3D](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24528v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics, supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages without the refrences, 4 figures, sybmitted for ICLR 2026 conference</p></details> |
| **[Context and Diversity Matter: The Emergence of In-Context Learning in World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22353v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge; and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynaNav: Dynamic Feature and Layer Selection for Efficient Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21930v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However, existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders, suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability. Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time, and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across four public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a poster in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Intentional Gesture: Deliver Your Intentions with Gestures for Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15197v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When humans speak, gestures help convey communicative intentions, such as adding emphasis or describing concepts. However, current co-speech gesture generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (e.g. speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To address this gap, we introduce Intentional-Gesture, a novel framework that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in high-level communicative functions. First, we curate the InG dataset by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (i.e., text sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the Intentional Gesture Motion Tokenizer to leverage these intention annotations. It injects high-level communicative functions (e.g., intentions) into tokenized motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture</p></details> |  |
| **[Can AI Perceive Physical Danger and Intervene?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21651v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent -- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions. The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at https://asimov-benchmark.github.io/v2</p></details> |  |
| **[iTACO: Interactable Digital Twins of Articulated Objects from Casually Captured RGBD Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08334v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Interactable digital twins of such objects have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. Unfortunately, current methods to digitize articulated real-world objects require carefully captured data, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable acquisition. We focus on motion analysis and part-level segmentation of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to obtain at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is challenging due to simultaneous object and camera motion and significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iTACO: a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories that is 20$\times$ larger than available in prior work. We then compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Our experiments show that iTACO outperforms existing articulated object digital twin methods on both synthetic and real casually captured RGBD videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website can be found at https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/video2articulation/</p></details> |
| **[Embodied AI: From LLMs to World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20021v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models (WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building internal representations and future predictions of the external world, facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances, covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e., embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs, meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE CASM</p></details> |
| **[SceneWeaver: All-in-One 3D Scene Synthesis with an Extensible and Self-Reflective Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20414v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

| **[PersONAL: Towards a Comprehensive Benchmark for Personalized Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19843v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Embodied AI have enabled agents to perform increasingly complex tasks and adapt to diverse environments. However, deploying such agents in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes. Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards real-world assistive robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plan Verification for LLM-Based Embodied Task Completion Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02761v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions, redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout). The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied Arena: A Comprehensive, Unified, and Evolving Evaluation Platform for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15273v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI development significantly lags behind large foundation models due to three critical challenges: (1) lack of systematic understanding of core capabilities needed for Embodied AI, making research lack clear objectives; (2) absence of unified and standardized evaluation systems, rendering cross-benchmark evaluation infeasible; and (3) underdeveloped automated and scalable acquisition methods for embodied data, creating critical bottlenecks for model scaling. To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25 fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view), providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially, we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the leaderboards of Embodied Arena. This helps to establish clear research veins and pinpoint critical research problems, thereby driving forward progress in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, Embodied Arena Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[VIR-Bench: Evaluating Geospatial and Temporal Understanding of MLLMs via Travel Video Itinerary Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19002v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmbodiedSplat: Personalized Real-to-Sim-to-Real Navigation with Gaussian Splats from a Mobile Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17430v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Embodied AI predominantly relies on simulation for training and evaluation, often using either fully synthetic environments that lack photorealism or high-fidelity real-world reconstructions captured with expensive hardware. As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate improvements of 20% and 40% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover, our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87-0.97) for the reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to diverse environments with minimal effort.

| **[Elevating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs with Auxiliary Embedding Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09585v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, the standard practice for developing MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/visper_lm/</p></details> |
| **[Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16176v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories (ACDC), an autonomous drone cinematography system driven by natural language communication between human directors and drones. The main limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent, which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models (VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.</p></details> |  |
| **[OptiScene: LLM-driven Indoor Scene Layout Generation via Scaled Human-aligned Data Synthesis and Multi-Stage Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07570v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emulating Human-like Adaptive Vision for Efficient and Flexible Machine Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15333v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition. Code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/AdaptiveNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThinkAct: Vision-Language-Action Reasoning via Reinforced Visual Latent Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16815v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

| **[RealMirror: A Comprehensive, Open-Source Vision-Language-Action Platform for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14687v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition, the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between simulation and the real world. To overcome these obstacles, we propose RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

| **[Embodied Navigation Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12129v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation is a fundamental capability in embodied AI, representing the intelligence required to perceive and interact within physical environments following language instructions. Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pku-epic.github.io/NavFoM-Web/</p></details> |

| **[Learning Precise Affordances from Egocentric Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10123v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Affordance, defined as the potential actions that an object offers, is crucial for embodied AI agents. For example, such knowledge directs an agent to grasp a knife by the handle for cutting or by the blade for safe handover. While existing approaches have made notable progress, affordance research still faces three key challenges: data scarcity, poor generalization, and real-world deployment. Specifically, there is a lack of large-scale affordance datasets with precise segmentation maps, existing models struggle to generalize across different domains or novel object and affordance classes, and little work demonstrates deployability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a complete affordance learning system that (1) takes in egocentric videos and outputs precise affordance annotations without human labeling, (2) leverages geometric information and vision foundation models to improve generalization, and (3) introduces a framework that facilitates affordance-oriented robotic manipulation such as tool grasping and robot-to-human tool handover. Experimental results show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by 13.8% in mIoU, and the framework achieves 77.1% successful grasping among 179 trials, including evaluations on seen, unseen classes, and cluttered scenes.

| **[Integrating Prior Observations for Incremental 3D Scene Graph Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11895v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships. While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world, incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g., CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented architecture will be made available at https://github.com/m4renz/incremental-scene-graph-prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 24th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'25)</p></details> |

This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents.

Existing approaches often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought (CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format, understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its robustness under limited onboard resources. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/Nav-R1.

| **[InternScenes: A Large-scale Simulatable Indoor Scene Dataset with Realistic Layouts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10813v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v6)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |

Traditional sequential computation patterns, while effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by 2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and providing high throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling.

Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://aopolin-lv.github.io/F1-VLA/</p></details> |

World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

| **[Generative World Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.</p></details> |  |

These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: multi-modal multi-task foundation models (M3T-FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas federated learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied AI environments. In this vision paper, we introduce multi-modal multi-task federated foundation models (M3T-FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of M3T-FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed training nature of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical deployment dimensions of M3T-FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning, Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for deploying M3T-FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs. Finally, we present a prototype implementation of M3T-FFMs and evaluate their energy and latency performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in IEEE Internet of Things Magazine, 2025</p></details> |

While existing methods have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication to encourage future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Model Implanting for Test-time Adaptation of Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03956v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models, the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability. In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  |

Unlike virtual AI, EAI systems can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. With recent advances in AI models and hardware, EAI systems are becoming increasingly capable across wider operational domains. While EAI systems can offer many benefits, they also pose significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, as well as economic and societal disruption. These risks require urgent attention from policymakers, as existing policies governing industrial robots and autonomous vehicles are insufficient to address the full range of concerns EAI systems present. To help address this issue, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a taxonomy of the physical, informational, economic, and social risks EAI systems pose. Second, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to assess how existing frameworks address these risks and to identify critical gaps. We conclude by offering policy recommendations for the safe and beneficial deployment of EAI systems, such as mandatory testing and certification schemes, clarified liability frameworks, and strategies to manage EAI's potentially transformative economic and societal impacts.</p></details> |  |

However, EAI systems introduce critical security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety, how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries; (2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with 2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3) ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era.

Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment.

Existing omnidirectional methods achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the \textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories (\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction, and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |
| **[RobotxR1: Enabling Embodied Robotic Intelligence on Large Language Models through Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03238v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future robotic systems operating in real-world environments will require on-board embodied intelligence without continuous cloud connection, balancing capabilities with constraints on computational power and memory. This work presents an extension of the R1-zero approach, which enables the usage of low parameter-count Large Language Models (LLMs) in the robotic domain. The R1-Zero approach was originally developed to enable mathematical reasoning in LLMs using static datasets. We extend it to the robotics domain through integration in a closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. This extension enhances reasoning in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) settings without relying solely on distillation of large models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We show that small-scale LLMs can achieve effective reasoning performance by learning through closed-loop interaction with their environment, which enables tasks that previously required significantly larger models. In an autonomous driving setting, a performance gain of 20.2%-points over the SFT-based baseline is observed with a Qwen2.5-1.5B model. Using the proposed training procedure, Qwen2.5-3B achieves a 63.3% control adaptability score, surpassing the 58.5% obtained by the much larger, cloud-bound GPT-4o. These results highlight that practical, on-board deployment of small LLMs is not only feasible but can outperform larger models if trained through environmental feedback, underscoring the importance of an interactive learning framework for robotic Embodied AI, one grounded in practical experience rather than static supervision.</p></details> |  |

This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the emergence of Multi-modal Large Models (MLMs) and World Models (WMs) have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable perception, interaction, and reasoning capabilities, making them a promising architecture for embodied agents. In this survey, we give a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements in Embodied AI.

Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> |
| **[FetchBot: Learning Generalizable Object Fetching in Cluttered Scenes via Zero-Shot Sim2Real](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17894v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizable object fetching in cluttered scenes remains a fundamental and application-critical challenge in embodied AI. Closely packed objects cause inevitable occlusions, making safe action generation particularly difficult. Under such partial observability, effective policies must not only generalize across diverse objects and layouts but also reason about occlusion to avoid collisions. However, collecting large-scale real-world data for this task remains prohibitively expensive, leaving this problem largely unsolved. In this paper, we introduce FetchBot, a sim-to-real framework for this challenge. We first curate a large-scale synthetic dataset featuring 1M diverse scenes and 500k representative demonstrations. Based on this dataset, FetchBot employs a depth-conditioned method for action generation, which leverages structural cues to enable robust obstacle-aware action planning. However, depth is perfect in simulation but noisy in real-world environments. To address this sim-to-real gap, FetchBot predicts depth from RGB inputs using a foundation model and integrates local occupancy prediction as a pre-training task, providing a generalizable latent representation for sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the strong zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, effective clutter handling, and adaptability to novel scenarios. In cluttered environments, it achieves an average real-world success rate of 89.95%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, FetchBot demonstrates excellent robustness in challenging cases, such as fetching transparent, reflective, and irregular objects, highlighting its practical value.</p></details> | <details><summary>9th A...</summary><p>9th Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025, Oral)</p></details> |

In this work, we address the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture. Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval; (ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of 3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass; (iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation, potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks.

However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution, and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands. This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500 complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot. We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.</p></details> |  |

Firstly, it chronicles the developmental trajectory of VLA architectures. Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of current research across 5 critical dimensions: VLA model structures, training datasets, pre-training methods, post-training methods, and model evaluation.

To formalize this setting, we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by both LLM-based and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + 2 pages references + 7 pages appendix</p></details> |

However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances.

In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |

The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness, executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments, accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored. It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and the attribution of scientific credit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied Image Quality Assessment for Robotic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18774v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of User-Generated Content (UGC) is a critical technique for human Quality of Experience (QoE). However, does the the image quality of Robot-Generated Content (RGC) demonstrate traits consistent with the Moravec paradox, potentially conflicting with human perceptual norms? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the perception mechanism of embodied robots for image quality. We propose the first Embodied Preference Database (EPD), which contains 12,500 distorted image annotations. We establish assessment metrics based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, there is a gap between UGC and RGC. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-scale Attention Embodied Image Quality Assessment called MA-EIQA. For the proposed EPD dataset, this is the first no-reference IQA model designed for embodied robot. Finally, the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment.

We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems.

| **[Towards Affordance-Aware Robotic Dexterous Grasping with Human-like Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08896v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage, a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects, unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms, detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution, and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing decision-making and learning.

General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization, which limits their applicability in embodied AI such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose a skill-oriented MoE called MoSE, which mimics the human learning and reasoning process skill-by-skill, step-by-step. We introduce a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. To better align with multi-step planning in human reasoning and in end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike other multi-round dialogues, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g. perception-prediction-planning for AD, and high-level and low-level planning for robots) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model effectively grows more diverse expertise and outperforms models on both AD corner-case reasoning tasks and robot reasoning tasks with less than 40% of the parameters.</p></details> |  |

We also provide a rich variety of playable entities, including humans, animals, robots, and vehicles for embodied AI research. We extend UnrealCV with optimized APIs and tools for data collection, environment augmentation, distributed training, and benchmarking. These improvements achieve significant improvements in the efficiency of rendering and communication, enabling advanced applications such as multi-agent interactions. Our experimental evaluation across visual navigation and tracking tasks reveals two key insights: 1) environmental diversity provides substantial benefits for developing generalizable reinforcement learning (RL) agents, and 2) current embodied agents face persistent challenges in open-world scenarios, including navigation in unstructured terrain, adaptation to unseen morphologies, and managing latency in the close-loop control systems for interacting in highly dynamic objects. UnrealZoo thus serves as both a comprehensive testing ground and a pathway toward developing more capable embodied AI systems for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight), Project page: http://unrealzoo.site/</p></details> |

Generating synthetic images that closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins, facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using images generated by DiffPhysCam.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 17 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

This task requires the model to identify newly described objects that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that 3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

As robotics and automated systems scale, efficient data-sharing frameworks and robust algorithms become critical. We explore the pivotal role of data handling in next-gen networks, focusing on dynamics between application and network providers (AP/NP) in DT ecosystems. We introduce PANAMA, a novel algorithm with Priority Asymmetry for Network Aware Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based multi-agent path finding (MAPF). By adopting a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework and asynchronous actor-learner architectures, PANAMA accelerates training while enabling autonomous task execution by embodied AI. Our approach demonstrates superior pathfinding performance in accuracy, speed, and scalability compared to existing benchmarks. Through simulations, we highlight optimized data-sharing strategies for scalable, automated systems, ensuring resilience in complex, real-world environments. PANAMA bridges the gap between network-aware decision-making and robust multi-agent coordination, advancing the synergy between DTs, wireless networks, and AI-driven automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety of Embodied Navigation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05855v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention, particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety and increasing industrial efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniEAR: Benchmarking Agent Reasoning in Embodied Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05614v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to 56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically (0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/OmniEmbodied Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/OmniEmbodied</p></details> |

In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentSense: Virtual Sensor Data Generation Using LLM Agents in Simulated Home Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11773v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence.

| **[Exploring 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Activity Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D task planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advances in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the RoboTron-Craft, a stage-divided and cost-effective pipeline for realistic manipulation generation. Base on this, the RoboTron-Platter method is introduced, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.

| **[Object Affordance Recognition and Grounding via Multi-scale Cross-modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01184v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification). Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance grounding and classification.</p></details> |  |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |

We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open physical-world embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Robots with soft bodies are examples of such physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully addressed to date.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 figures.

Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.</p></details> |  |

While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive, expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types, combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation) generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive humanoid motion generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://rosielab.github.io/compas3d</p></details> |
| **[Advances in 4D Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14501v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative artificial intelligence has recently progressed from static image and video synthesis to 3D content generation, culminating in the emergence of 4D generation-the task of synthesizing temporally coherent dynamic 3D assets guided by user input. As a burgeoning research frontier, 4D generation enables richer interactive and immersive experiences, with applications ranging from digital humans to autonomous driving. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks a unified understanding of 4D representations, generative frameworks, basic paradigms, and the core technical challenges it faces. This survey provides a systematic and in-depth review of the 4D generation landscape. To comprehensively characterize 4D generation, we first categorize fundamental 4D representations and outline associated techniques for 4D generation. We then present an in-depth analysis of representative generative pipelines based on conditions and representation methods. Subsequently, we discuss how motion and geometry priors are integrated into 4D outputs to ensure spatio-temporal consistency under various control schemes. From an application perspective, this paper summarizes 4D generation tasks in areas such as dynamic object/scene generation, digital human synthesis, editable 4D content, and embodied AI. Furthermore, we summarize and multi-dimensionally compare four basic paradigms for 4D generation: End-to-End, Generated-Data-Based, Implicit-Distillation-Based, and Explicit-Supervision-Based. Concluding our analysis, we highlight five key challenges-consistency, controllability, diversity, efficiency, and fidelity-and contextualize these with current approaches.By distilling recent advances and outlining open problems, this work offers a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective to guide future research in 4D generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards provable probabilistic safety for scalable embodied AI systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05171v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. Instead, empirical safety evaluation is employed as an alternative, but the absence of provable guarantees imposes significant limitations. To address these issues, we argue for a paradigm shift to provable probabilistic safety that integrates provable guarantees with progressive achievement toward a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance. The new paradigm better leverages statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability, and a well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for provable probabilistic safety, along with corresponding challenges and potential solutions. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, this Perspective offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  |

Unlike offline video understanding, streaming video understanding requires the ability to process video streams frame by frame, preserve historical information, and make low-latency decisions. To address these challenges, our main contributions are three-fold. (i) We develop a novel streaming video backbone, termed as StreamFormer, by incorporating causal temporal attention into a pre-trained vision transformer. This enables efficient streaming video processing while maintaining image representation capability. (ii) To train StreamFormer, we propose to unify diverse spatial-temporal video understanding tasks within a multitask visual-language alignment framework. Hence, StreamFormer learns global semantics, temporal dynamics, and fine-grained spatial relationships simultaneously.

PR2 offers high-quality scene rendering and robot dynamic simulation, enabling (i) the creation of diverse scenes using various digital assets, (ii) the integration of advanced perception or foundation models, and (iii) the implementation of planning and control algorithms for dynamic humanoid robot behaviors based on environmental feedback. The beta version of PR2 has been deployed for the simulation track of a nationwide full-size humanoid robot competition for college students, attracting 137 teams and over 400 participants within four months. This competition covered traditional tasks in bipedal walking, as well as novel challenges in loco-manipulation and language-instruction-based object search, marking a first for public college robotics competitions. A retrospective analysis of the competition suggests that future events should emphasize the integration of locomotion with manipulation and perception.

As they serve as the primary visual input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning. EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering (PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover, we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for on-device egomotion video reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \textbf{PhysX-3D}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research in generative physical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://physx-3d.github.io/</p></details> |

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

As a result, we are seeing similar advancements in embodied AI and robotics for control policy generation. Our review paper examines the integration of generative AI models with RL to advance robotics. Our primary focus is on the duality between generative AI and RL for robotics downstream tasks. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The role of prominent generative AI tools as modular priors for multi-modal input fusion in RL tasks. (2) How RL can train, fine-tune and distill generative models for policy generation, such as VLA models, similarly to RL applications in large language models. We then propose a new taxonomy based on a considerable amount of selected papers. Lastly, we identify open challenges accounting for model scalability, adaptation and grounding, giving recommendations and insights on future research directions. We reflect on which generative AI models best fit the RL tasks and why. On the other side, we reflect on important issues inherent to RL-enhanced generative policies, such as safety concerns and failure modes, and what are the limitations of current methods.

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

| **[UniAPL: A Unified Adversarial Preference Learning Framework for Instruct-Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25148v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment. We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g., Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich, ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient, ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's. UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration, inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507 as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Era of Real-World Human Interaction: RL from User Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25137v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users' natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable, effective supervision for personalized alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Entropy Regularization in Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25133v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence. Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel framework for investigating the formation and adaptation of such world models within a biological substrate: human neural organoids. We present a curriculum of three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train these biological agents and probe the underlying synaptic mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments that demand progressively more sophisticated world models for successful decision-making: (1) a conditional avoidance task for learning static state-action contingencies, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario for goal-directed interaction, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game for modeling dynamic, continuous-time systems. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation, which serve to drive model refinement. In a significant methodological advance, we propose a meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model automates the generative design and optimization of experimental protocols, thereby scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal evaluation strategy that moves beyond task performance to directly measure the physical correlates of the learned world model by quantifying synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between model-based reinforcement learning and computational neuroscience, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, decision-making, and the physical basis of intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

However, for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks such as robotic soccer, this end-to-end approach often fails due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in developing embodied world models is not merely increasing the fidelity or size of environments, but scaling their structural complexity through explicit hierarchical scaffolding. We posit that an effective world model for decision-making must model not only the world's physics but also its task semantics. Drawing from a systematic review of 2024 research in low-resource multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Bayesian Strategy Networks (BSNs), with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These methods decompose complex goals into manageable subgoals, creating an intrinsic curriculum that shapes agent learning. We propose that such structured environments are essential for bridging the gap between simple, reactive behaviors and sophisticated, strategic team play. We further extend this principle, proposing that this scaffolding can be generalized to other complex domains and dynamically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which act as generative world models of tasks. By building environments with explicit, composable task layers, we can guide agent exploration more efficiently, generate meaningful learning signals, and ultimately train more capable and general-purpose agents with fewer resources than purely end-to-end approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Embodied World Models for Decision Making (EWM)</p></details> |

Traditional methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, hindering their robustness. To overcome this, we propose BRIDGE, an RL-optimized depth-to-image (D2I) generation framework that synthesizes over 20M realistic and geometrically accurate RGB images, each intrinsically paired with its ground truth depth, from diverse source depth maps. Then we train our depth estimation model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth features.

| **[Cogito, Ergo Ludo: An Agent that Learns to Play by Reasoning and Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25052v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito, ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e., Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world through explicit reasoning on raw experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advantage Weighted Matching: Aligning RL with Pretraining in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25050v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs), where pre-training and RL post-training share the same log-likelihood formulation. In contrast, recent RL approaches for diffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO), optimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow matching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is an implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases variance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce \textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for diffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a lower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage. In effect, AWM raises the influence of high-reward samples and suppresses low-reward ones while keeping the modeling objective identical to pretraining. This unifies pretraining and RL conceptually and practically, is consistent with policy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and yields faster convergence. This simple yet effective design yields substantial benefits: on GenEval, OCR, and PickScore benchmarks, AWM delivers up to a $24\times$ speedup over Flow-GRPO (which builds on DDPO), when applied to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX, without compromising generation quality. Code is available at https://github.com/scxue/advantage_weighted_matching.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Synthetic Task Generation for Agents via Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25047v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information, which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover possible interactions and current state information to synthesize environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on human annotation.</p></details> |  |

Modern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading uncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These uncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental variability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons downstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional centralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational complexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve effective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we present MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by starling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment, separation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs to make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In addition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to adapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on real-world USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\%, cuts computation by 35\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\%, exhibiting super-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000 nodes. These results demonstrate MARLIN's potential for disaster prevention and protecting communities through intelligent, scalable water resource management.</p></details> |  |

The instability of the training process easily disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work, we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues: contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting. Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization and transfer better to other benchmarks.

EO tasks introduce unique challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning, change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to diverse EO tasks.

| **[MARCOS: Deep Thinking by Markov Chain of Continuous Thoughts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25020v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves models "thinking out loud" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought (CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks. Firstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT tokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains reasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck across reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with token generation, forcing LLMs to "think while speaking," which causes potentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we re-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our approach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as a hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional "thoughts". Each reasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit reasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable variables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this latent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we further propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous reasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to token-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup in inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as step-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant opportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diversity-Enhanced Reasoning for Subjective Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20187v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with long chain-of-thought capabilities, optimized via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), excel at objective reasoning tasks like mathematical problem solving and code generation. However, RLVR is known for degrading generation diversity, which causes LRMs to fall short on subjective reasoning that has multiple answers depending on different role perspectives. While recent studies recognize the importance of diversity-enhanced training in objective reasoning, limited attention has been given to subjective tasks. In this paper, we find that subjective reasoning can be improved by introducing perspective diversity and token-level diversity, with the former one providing a coherent scaffolding anchored to a real-world stakeholder group and the latter one broadening the answer search space. We propose MultiRole-R1, a diversity-enhanced training framework featuring an unsupervised data construction pipeline that synthesizes reasoning chains incorporating various role perspectives. It also employs reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization with reward shaping, taking diversity as a reward signal in addition to verifiable reward. Training on subjective tasks solely, MultiRole-R1 increases the in-domain and out-of-domain accuracy by 14.1% and 7.64%, and even enhances the performance on advanced math reasoning such as AIME 2024. We further show that diversity is a more consistent indicator of accuracy than reasoning length.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLPO: Curriculum Learning meets Policy Optimization for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25004v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered, while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1 improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more efficiently training more capable reasoning models.</p></details> |  |

Existing scheduling methods often lack adaptability to dynamic workloads and network variability inherent in IoT-cloud systems. This paper presents a novel hybrid scheduling algorithm combining deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to address these challenges. The deep RL agent utilizes a model-free policy-gradient approach to learn adaptive task allocation policies responsive to real-time workload fluctuations and network states. Simultaneously, the ACO metaheuristic conducts a global combinatorial search to optimize resource distribution, mitigate congestion, and balance load across distributed cloud nodes. Extensive experiments on large-scale synthetic IoT datasets, reflecting diverse workloads and QoS constraints, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 18.4% reduction in average response time, 12.7% improvement in resource utilization, and 9.3% decrease in energy consumption compared to leading heuristics and RL-only baselines. Moreover, the algorithm ensures strict Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance through deadline-aware scheduling and dynamic prioritization. The results confirm the effectiveness of integrating model-free RL with swarm intelligence for scalable, energy-efficient IoT data scheduling, offering a promising approach for next-generation IoT-cloud platforms.</p></details> | 17 pages long |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[World-Env: Leveraging World Model as a Virtual Environment for VLA Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24948v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and (2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task. Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Distinguishable Representations in Deep Q-Networks for Linear Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24947v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs. Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage the internal representations learned by the neural network during training. Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby reducing computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02912v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end, with agents generating messages and actions concurrently. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), to simulate future states. Agents then communicate a summary of this plan. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

| **[What Do You Need for Diverse Trajectory Composition in Diffusion Planning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18083v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In planning, stitching is an ability of algorithms to piece together sub-trajectories of data they are trained on to generate new and diverse behaviours. While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.</p></details> | 9 Pages |
| **[When Greedy Wins: Emergent Exploitation Bias in Meta-Bandit LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24923v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents, they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance, and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models, prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust exploratory behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-Learning to Explore via Memory Density Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02831v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration algorithms for reinforcement learning typically replace or augment the reward function with an additional ``intrinsic'' reward that trains the agent to seek previously unseen states of the environment. Here, we consider an exploration algorithm that exploits meta-learning, or learning to learn, such that the agent learns to maximize its exploration progress within a single episode, even between epochs of training. The agent learns a policy that aims to minimize the probability density of new observations with respect to all of its memories. In addition, it receives as feedback evaluations of the current observation density and retains that feedback in a recurrent network. By remembering trajectories of density, the agent learns to navigate a complex and growing landscape of familiarity in real-time, allowing it to maximize its exploration progress even in completely novel states of the environment for which its policy has not been trained.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Small Vectors, Big Effects: A Mechanistic Study of RL-Induced Reasoning via Steering Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06608v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes LLMs' internal computations remain unclear. We study lightweight steering vectors inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a reinforcement-learning objective. These vectors match full fine-tuning performance while preserving the interpretability of small, additive interventions. Using logit-lens readouts and path-patching analyses on two models, we find that (i) the last-layer steering vector acts like a token-substitution bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens such as "To" and "Step"; (ii) the penultimate-layer vector leaves attention patterns largely intact and instead operates through the MLP and unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols; and (iii) middle layers de-emphasize non-English tokens. Next, we show that a SAE isolates features associated with correct generations. We also show that steering vectors (i) transfer to other models, (ii) combine across layers when trained in isolation, and (iii) concentrate magnitude on meaningful prompt segments under adaptive token-wise scaling. Taken together, these results deepen understanding of how trained steering vectors shape computation and should inform future work in activation engineering and the study of reasoning models.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this paper, we study the problem of aerial ball juggling using a quadrotor equipped with a racket, a task that demands accurate timing, stable control, and continuous adaptation. We propose JuggleRL, the first reinforcement learning-based system for aerial juggling. It learns closed-loop policies in large-scale simulation using systematic calibration of quadrotor and ball dynamics to reduce the sim-to-real gap. The training incorporates reward shaping to encourage racket-centered hits and sustained juggling, as well as domain randomization over ball position and coefficient of restitution to enhance robustness and transferability. The learned policy outputs mid-level commands executed by a low-level controller and is deployed zero-shot on real hardware, where an enhanced perception module with a lightweight communication protocol reduces delays in high-frequency state estimation and ensures real-time control. Experiments show that JuggleRL achieves an average of $311$ hits over $10$ consecutive trials in the real world, with a maximum of $462$ hits observed, far exceeding a model-based baseline that reaches at most $14$ hits with an average of $3.1$. Moreover, the policy generalizes to unseen conditions, successfully juggling a lighter $5$ g ball with an average of $145.9$ hits. This work demonstrates that reinforcement learning can empower aerial robots with robust and stable control in dynamic interaction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retro*: Optimizing LLMs for Reasoning-Intensive Document Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24869v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly important to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even when their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this problem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance between the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a significant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in applicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism, which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each training sample. Our experiments show that Retro* outperforms existing document retrieval methods with notable advantages, leading to state-of-the-art performance on the BRIGHT benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vintix: Action Model via In-Context Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19400v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) represents a promising paradigm for developing generalist agents that learn at inference time through trial-and-error interactions, analogous to how large language models adapt contextually, but with a focus on reward maximization. However, the scalability of ICRL beyond toy tasks and single-domain settings remains an open challenge. In this work, we present the first steps toward scaling ICRL by introducing a fixed, cross-domain model capable of learning behaviors through in-context reinforcement learning. Our results demonstrate that Algorithm Distillation, a framework designed to facilitate ICRL, offers a compelling and competitive alternative to expert distillation to construct versatile action models. These findings highlight the potential of ICRL as a scalable approach for generalist decision-making systems. Code released at https://github.com/dunnolab/vintix</p></details> | ICML 2025, Poster |

We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying L2 penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pushing LLMs to Their Logical Reasoning Bound: The Role of Data Reasoning Intensity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24836v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However, most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.</p></details> |  |

We show that applying task-alignment to neural machine translation (NMT) addresses an existing task--data mismatch in NMT, leading to improvements across all languages of a multilingual model, even when task-alignment is only applied to a subset of those languages. We do so by introducing Direct Quality Optimization (DQO), a variant of DPO leveraging a pre-trained translation quality estimation model as a proxy for human preferences, and verify the improvements with both automatic metrics and human evaluation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Intelligent Optimization of Wireless Access Point Deployment for Communication-Based Train Control Systems Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24819v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban railway systems increasingly rely on communication based train control (CBTC) systems, where optimal deployment of access points (APs) in tunnels is critical for robust wireless coverage. Traditional methods, such as empirical model-based optimization algorithms, are hindered by excessive measurement requirements and suboptimal solutions, while machine learning (ML) approaches often struggle with complex tunnel environments. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) driven framework that integrates parabolic wave equation (PWE) channel modeling, conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) for AP placement optimization. The PWE method generates high-fidelity path loss distributions for a subset of AP positions, which are then expanded by the cGAN to create high resolution path loss maps for all candidate positions, significantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical accuracy. In the DRL framework, the state space captures AP positions and coverage, the action space defines AP adjustments, and the reward function encourages signal improvement while penalizing deployment costs. The dueling DQN enhances convergence speed and exploration exploitation balance, increasing the likelihood of reaching optimal configurations. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method outperforms a conventional Hooke Jeeves optimizer and traditional DQN, delivering AP configurations with higher average received power, better worst-case coverage, and improved computational efficiency. This work integrates high-fidelity electromagnetic simulation, generative modeling, and AI-driven optimization, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for next-generation CBTC systems in complex tunnel environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[DyMoDreamer: World Modeling with Dynamic Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24804v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model (RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\% performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark.

| **[Off-Policy Maximum Entropy RL with Future State and Action Visitation Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06655v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximum entropy reinforcement learning integrates exploration into policy learning by providing additional intrinsic rewards proportional to the entropy of some distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach in which the intrinsic reward function is the relative entropy of the discounted distribution of states and actions (or features derived from these states and actions) visited during future time steps. This approach is motivated by two results. First, a policy maximizing the expected discounted sum of intrinsic rewards also maximizes a lower bound on the state-action value function of the decision process. Second, the distribution used in the intrinsic reward definition is the fixed point of a contraction operator. Existing algorithms can therefore be adapted to learn this fixed point off-policy and to compute the intrinsic rewards. We finally introduce an algorithm maximizing our new objective, and we show that resulting policies have good state-action space coverage and achieve high-performance control.</p></details> |  |

We present a systematic study of perception strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception, especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning, and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual, textual, and consistency rewards.

| **[Robust Policy Expansion for Offline-to-Online RL under Diverse Data Corruption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24748v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed $\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion. Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios.

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a potential alternative to generate demonstrations autonomously, yet conventional RL algorithms often struggle on long-horizon manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose a modified diffusion policy optimization algorithm to generate high-quality and low-variance trajectories, which contributes to a diffusion RL-powered VLA training pipeline. Our algorithm benefits from not only the high expressiveness of diffusion models to explore complex and diverse behaviors but also the implicit regularization of the iterative denoising process to yield smooth and consistent demonstrations. We evaluate our approach on the LIBERO benchmark, which includes 130 long-horizon manipulation tasks, and show that the generated trajectories are smoother and more consistent than both human demonstrations and those from standard Gaussian RL policies. Further, training a VLA model exclusively on the diffusion RL-generated data achieves an average success rate of 81.9%, which outperforms the model trained on human data by +5.3% and that on Gaussian RL-generated data by +12.6%. The results highlight our diffusion RL as an effective alternative for generating abundant, high-quality, and low-variance demonstrations for VLA models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Softmax: A Natural Parameterization for Categorical Random Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24728v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1) revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the $\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$ is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases. Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Circuit-Aware Reward Training: A Mechanistic Framework for Longtail Robustness in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24713v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) reward models exhibit systematic failures on longtail distributions, leading to reward hacking and misalignment. We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Expansive Mappings in Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation: Finite-Time Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10806v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithms are iterative methods used in applications such as optimization, reinforcement learning, and control. Finite-time analysis of these algorithms has primarily focused on fixed point iterations where both time-scales have contractive mappings. In this work, we broaden the scope of such analyses by considering settings where the slower time-scale has a non-expansive mapping. For such algorithms, the slower time-scale can be viewed as a stochastic inexact Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. We also study a variant where the faster time-scale has a projection step which leads to non-expansiveness in the slower time-scale. We show that the last-iterate mean square residual error for such algorithms decays at a rate $O(1/k^{1/4-\epsilon})$, where $\epsilon>0$ is arbitrarily small. We further establish almost sure convergence of iterates to the set of fixed points. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by applying our results to minimax optimization, linear stochastic approximation, and Lagrangian optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization</p></details> |

However, existing reward models often lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable RL training. We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences (TD) for training-time reinforcement learning and inference-time verification. Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%) settings. When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable performance with just 2.5k data to what baseline methods require 50.1k data to attain -- and yield higher-quality language model policies in 8 model variants (5 series), e.g., Qwen2.5-(0.5B, 1,5B), GLM4-9B-0414, GLM-Z1-9B-0414, Qwen2.5-Math-(1.5B, 7B), and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-(1.5B, 7B).

| **[Reward Model Overoptimisation in Iterated RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18126v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a widely used method for aligning large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the reward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the idiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is iterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated human feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption, the dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in iterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model training data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used for optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled AlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over successive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth preferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while reinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation flexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early overoptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more stable and generalisable RLHF pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 17 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Emergent World Representations in OpenVLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24559v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Action models (VLAs) trained with policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) encode complex behaviors without explicitly modeling environmental dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines (embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning in Action: Real-Time Control of Vortex-Induced Vibrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24556v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80% vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.</p></details> |  |

However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://danijar.com/dreamer4/</p></details> |

In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases. Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model performance.</p></details> | Under review |

To validate their effectiveness, RL algorithms have to be evaluated across multiple case studies. Case study design is an arduous task requiring the consideration of many aspects, among them the influence of available forecasts and the level of decentralization in the control structure. Furthermore, vanilla RL controllers cannot themselves ensure the satisfaction of system constraints, which makes devising a safeguarding mechanism a necessary task for every case study before deploying the system. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Python tool CommonPower, the first general framework for the modeling and simulation of power system management tailored towards machine learning. Its modular architecture enables users to focus on specific elements without having to implement a simulation environment. Another unique contribution of CommonPower is the automatic synthesis of model predictive controllers and safeguards. Beyond offering a unified interface for single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, CommonPower includes a training pipeline for machine-learning-based forecasters as well as a flexible mechanism for incorporating feedback of safeguards into the learning updates of RL controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>For t...</summary><p>For the corresponding code repository, see https://github.com/TUMcps/commonpower</p></details> |

However, it's pretty challenging to meet various prerequisites utilizing traditional control methods. Therefore, we propose an effective two-stage learning from demonstrations training framework, FISHER, to highlight the adaptability of reinforcement learning (RL) methods in the multi-AUV underwater target tracking task, while addressing its limitations such as extensive requirements for environmental interactions and the challenges in designing reward functions. The first stage utilizes imitation learning (IL) to realize policy improvement and generate offline datasets. To be specific, we introduce multi-agent discriminator-actor-critic based on improvements of the generative adversarial IL algorithm and multi-agent IL optimization objective derived from the Nash equilibrium condition. Then in the second stage, we develop multi-agent independent generalized decision transformer, which analyzes the latent representation to match the future states of high-quality samples rather than reward function, attaining further enhanced policies capable of handling various scenarios. Besides, we propose a simulation to simulation demonstration generation procedure to facilitate the generation of expert demonstrations in underwater environments, which capitalizes on traditional control methods and can easily accomplish the domain transfer to obtain demonstrations. Extensive simulation experiments from multiple scenarios showcase that FISHER possesses strong stability, multi-task performance and capability of generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.

| **[Visual Planning: Let's Think Only with Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11409v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have substantially enhanced machine reasoning across diverse tasks. However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for both expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is present. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most natural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving spatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new paradigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual representations for these "vision-first" tasks, as a supplementary channel to language-based reasoning. In this paradigm, planning is executed via sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual domain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement Learning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models, leading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of representative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our visual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct reasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a viable and promising supplement to language-based reasoning, opening new avenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables (31 pages, 15 figures, 10 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |
| **[Guided Reinforcement Learning for Omnidirectional 3D Jumping in Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16481v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jumping poses a significant challenge for quadruped robots, despite being crucial for many operational scenarios. While optimisation methods exist for controlling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive knowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in real-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable alternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of sample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and predictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the safety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages physical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining B\'ezier curves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sotopia-RL: Reward Design for Social Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03905v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability, where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards. Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking. Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17 on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training.

However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for reasoning. Specifically, sparse rewards fail to deliver sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such rewards induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across intermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a method designed to deliver dense rewards and amplify exploration in the RL-based paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; error-conditioned reward allocation to ensure efficient exploration on challenging samples while intrinsically stabilizing training; and advantage-preserving integration that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across 4 public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness, achieving a 22.23\% improvement on AIME 2024.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Mid-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24375v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of state-of-the-art large language models is commonly understood as a two-stage process involving pre-training and post-training. We point out the need for an additional intermediate stage called reinforcement mid-training with potential for strong performance gains. In this paper, we formally define the problem and identify three key challenges: (1) inefficient training due to excessive reasoning steps, (2) disregard of the imbalanced token entropy distribution, and (3) underutilization of token information. To address these challenges, we propose RMT, a framework for efficient, adaptive, and unified reinforcement mid-training with various innovative components. In particular, we first introduce a dynamic token budget mechanism that constrains unnecessary reasoning steps and mitigates model overthinking. Next, we design a curriculum-based adaptive sampling method that fosters a progressive learning trajectory from easy to hard tokens. Finally, we present a dual training strategy that combines reinforcement learning with next-token prediction, ensuring targeted learning on key tokens and full exploitation of all token information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RMT over state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +64.91% performance improvement with only 21% of the reasoning length in language modeling. We also show that checkpoints obtained after reinforcement mid-training can benefit the subsequent post-training, yielding up to +18.76% improvement in the mathematical domain.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement learning (RL) is arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters, was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency, tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond what current RL techniques provide.

Especially, LLM planning for multi-agent collaboration requires communication of agents or credit assignment as the feedback to re-adjust the proposed plans and achieve effective coordination. However, existing methods that overly rely on physical verification or self-reflection suffer from excessive and inefficient querying of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-agent collaboration that introduces Reinforced Advantage feedback (ReAd) for efficient self-refinement of plans. Specifically, we perform critic regression to learn a sequential advantage function from LLM-planned data, and then treat the LLM planner as an optimizer to generate actions that maximize the advantage function. It endows the LLM with the foresight to discern whether the action contributes to accomplishing the final task. We provide theoretical analysis by extending advantage-weighted regression in reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems. Experiments on Overcooked-AI and a difficult variant of RoCoBench show that ReAd surpasses baselines in success rate, and also significantly decreases the interaction steps of agents and query rounds of LLMs, demonstrating its high efficiency for grounding LLMs. More results are given at https://embodied-read.github.io</p></details> | accepted by ACL'2025 |

In complex urban scenarios, however, uniform or heuristic sampling often produces many infeasible or irrelevant trajectories. We address this limitation with a hybrid framework that learns where to sample while keeping trajectory generation and evaluation fully analytical and verifiable. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent guides the sampling process toward regions of the action space likely to yield feasible trajectories, while evaluation and final selection remains governed by deterministic feasibility checks and cost functions. We couple the RL sampler with a world model (WM) based on a decodable deep set encoder, enabling both variable numbers of traffic participants and reconstructable latent representations. The approach is evaluated in the CommonRoad simulation environment, showing up to 99% fewer required samples and a runtime reduction of up to 84% while maintaining planning quality in terms of success and collision-free rates. These improvements lead to faster, more reliable decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, achieving safer and more responsive navigation under real-world constraints.

While non-distributed methods are well understood theoretically and have achieved remarkable empirical success, their distributed counterparts remain less explored, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous asynchronous computations and communication bottlenecks. We introduce two new algorithms, Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT, which implement asynchronous policy gradient aggregation and achieve state-of-the-art efficiency. In the homogeneous setting, Rennala NIGT provably improves the total computational and communication complexity while supporting the AllReduce operation. In the heterogeneous setting, Malenia NIGT simultaneously handles asynchronous computations and heterogeneous environments with strictly better theoretical guarantees. Our results are further corroborated by experiments, showing that our methods significantly outperform prior approaches.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1 (72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Yet, the emergence of this "slow-thinking" paradigm, with numerous tokens generated in sequence, inevitably introduces substantial computational overhead. To this end, it highlights an urgent need for effective acceleration. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in efficient reasoning. It categorizes existing works into three key directions: (1) shorter - compressing lengthy CoTs into concise yet effective reasoning chains; (2) smaller - developing compact language models with strong reasoning capabilities through techniques such as knowledge distillation, other model compression techniques, and reinforcement learning; and (3) faster - designing efficient decoding strategies to accelerate inference of reasoning models.

In this paper, we propose AIM-Mapping, a Asymmetric InforMation Enhanced Mapping framework. The framework fully utilizes the privilege information in the training process to help construct the environment representation as well as the supervised signal in an asymmetric actor-critic training framework. Specifically, privilege information is used to evaluate the exploration performance through an asymmetric feature representation module and a mutual information evaluation module. The decision-making network uses the trained feature encoder to extract structure information from the environment and combines it with a topological map constructed based on geometric distance. Utilizing this kind of topological map representation, we employ topological graph matching to assign corresponding boundary points to each robot as long-term goal points. We conduct experiments in real-world-like scenarios using the Gibson simulation environments. It validates that the proposed method, when compared to existing methods, achieves great performance improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Framework for ESP Cheater Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24274v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which further complicates detection and detector development. To address these challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing effective cheat detectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk-Sensitive RL for Alleviating Exploration Dilemmas in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24261v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm, Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement, requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnesSuite: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Dataset Suite for Anesthesiology Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02404v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of large language models (LLMs) in the medical field has garnered significant attention, yet their reasoning capabilities in more specialized domains like anesthesiology remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnesSuite, the first comprehensive dataset suite specifically designed for anesthesiology reasoning in LLMs. The suite features AnesBench, an evaluation benchmark tailored to assess anesthesiology-related reasoning across three levels: factual retrieval (System 1), hybrid reasoning (System 1.x), and complex decision-making (System 2). Alongside this benchmark, the suite includes three training datasets that provide an infrastructure for continued pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Leveraging this suite, we develop Morpheus, the first baseline model collection for anesthesiology reasoning. Despite undergoing limited training with SFT and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), Morpheus demonstrates substantial performance improvements, rivaling the performance of larger-scale models. Furthermore, through comprehensive evaluations and experiments, we analyze the key factors influencing anesthesiology reasoning performance, including model characteristics, training strategies and training data. Both AnesSuite and Morpheus will be open-sourced at https://github.com/MiliLab/AnesSuite.</p></details> | 40 pages, 10 figures |

| **[Latent Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24251v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained: reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code base and model weights will be released later.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stepwise Guided Policy Optimization: Coloring your Incorrect Reasoning in GRPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11595v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). A widely adopted method, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown strong empirical results in training DeepSeek-R1. However, GRPO fails to update the policy when all responses within a group are incorrect (i.e., \emph{all-negative-sample} groups). This limitation underscores a key gap between artificial and human intelligence: unlike humans, who can learn from mistakes, GRPO discards these signals. Our first contribution is to introduce a simple framework that mitigates the all-negative-sample issue by incorporating response diversity within groups using a \textit{step-wise} judge model, which can be either directly trained or adapted from existing LLMs. We prove that this diversification can accelerate GRPO's learning dynamics in a simplified setting. We also empirically validate the proposed stepwise guided policy optimization (SGPO) method, demonstrating consistent gains across model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in offline and online training on 9 benchmarks, including base and distilled variants. Our results highlight two advantages: (i) SGPO surpasses GRPO, especially in the early and mid-training stages where all-negative-sample groups are prevalent; and (ii) SGPO does not require judge models to generate correct answers, differentiating it from knowledge distillation methods.</p></details> | 42 pages |
| **[Multi-Agent Guided Policy Search for Non-Cooperative Dynamic Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24226v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) optimizes strategic interactions in non-cooperative dynamic games, where agents have misaligned objectives. However, data-driven methods such as multi-agent policy gradients (MA-PG) often suffer from instability and limit-cycle behaviors. Prior stabilization techniques typically rely on entropy-based exploration, which slows learning and increases variance. We propose a model-based approach that incorporates approximate priors into the reward function as regularization. In linear quadratic (LQ) games, we prove that such priors stabilize policy gradients and guarantee local exponential convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium. We then extend this idea to infinite-horizon nonlinear games by introducing Multi-agent Guided Policy Search (MA-GPS), which constructs short-horizon local LQ approximations from trajectories of current policies to guide training. Experiments on nonlinear vehicle platooning and a six-player strategic basketball formation show that MA-GPS achieves faster convergence and more stable learning than existing MARL methods.</p></details> |  |

Deploying LLMs/VLMs for motion planning, however, faces two key obstacles: (i) symbolic plans are rarely grounded in scene geometry and object physics, and (ii) model outputs can vary for identical prompts, undermining execution reliability. We propose ViReSkill, a framework that pairs vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory for accumulation and reuse. When a failure occurs, the replanner generates a new action sequence conditioned on the current scene, tailored to the observed state. On success, the executed plan is stored as a reusable skill and replayed in future encounters without additional calls to LLMs/VLMs. This feedback loop enables autonomous continual learning: each attempt immediately expands the skill set and stabilizes subsequent executions. We evaluate ViReSkill on simulators such as LIBERO and RLBench as well as on a physical robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate, demonstrating robust sim-to-real generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDD-Thinker: Towards Large Reasoning Models for Major Depressive Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24217v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information. Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability, hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data. Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000 samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and state-of-the-art LLM baselines. Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081, significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and 34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency. Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader applications in mental health care.</p></details> |  |
| **[Group-Relative REINFORCE Is Secretly an Off-Policy Algorithm: Demystifying Some Myths About GRPO and Its Friends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24203v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss, and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is available at https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/rec_gsm8k.</p></details> |  |

However, two main challenges arise: i) planning (\ie, the action proposal sequence) under expansive action space, where selecting an appropriate plan is non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in complex and high-resolution interfaces, \ie, precisely interacting with visual targets. This paper investigates the aforementioned challenges with our \textbf{G}UI \textbf{T}est-time Scaling \textbf{A}gent, namely GTA1. First, we conduct test-time scaling to select the most appropriate action proposal: at each step, multiple candidate proposals are sampled and evaluated and selected by a judge model. It trades off computation for better decision quality by concurrent sampling. Second, we propose a model that improves grounding of the selected action proposals to its corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning (RL) facilitates grounding through inherent objective alignments, rewarding successful clicks on interface elements. Experimentally, GTA1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both grounding and agent task execution benchmarks. The code and models are released here.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation. We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and MATH500).</p></details> | preprint |
| **[On The Sample Complexity Bounds In Bilevel Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17644v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bilevel reinforcement learning (BRL) has emerged as a powerful framework for aligning generative models, yet its theoretical foundations, especially sample complexity bounds, remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first sample complexity bound for BRL, establishing a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ in continuous state-action spaces. Traditional MDP analysis techniques do not extend to BRL due to its nested structure and non-convex lower-level problems. We overcome these challenges by leveraging the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition and the MDP structure to obtain closed-form gradients, enabling tight sample complexity analysis. Our analysis also extends to general bi-level optimization settings with non-convex lower levels, where we achieve state-of-the-art sample complexity results of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ improving upon existing bounds of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Additionally, we address the computational bottleneck of hypergradient estimation by proposing a fully first-order, Hessian-free algorithm suitable for large-scale problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is updated version of the paper 2410.15610</p></details> |
| **[Robust Preference Optimization: Aligning Language Models with Noisy Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24159v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts, elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3 models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning or Retrieval? A Study of Answer Attribution on Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24156v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors: problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, applying MTRL to robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight. MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage, even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality of MTRL in robotics applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Magic Words: Sharpness-Aware Prompt Evolving for Robust Large Language Models with TARE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24130v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on carefully engineered prompts. However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging from heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search, primarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance or searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in practice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically preserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this brittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we provide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete, semantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion over a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no gradients to update the model's parameters. Then we introduce TARE (Textual Sharpness-Aware Evolving), a derivative-free framework that alternates between an inner, sampling-based adversarial search that stresses a prompt with hard paraphrases and an outer, robust selection that prefers candidates whose neighborhoods remain strong. We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic weights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to balance exploration and fidelity. Diverse tasks evaluate our methods, whose design for minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to prompts that preserve accuracy under paraphrasing, outperforming accuracy-only prompt search while remaining computationally practical.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Optimization for Feature Selection with Permutation-Invariant Embedding and Policy-Guided Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11601v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature selection removes redundant features to enhanc performance and computational efficiency in downstream tasks. Existing works often struggle to capture complex feature interactions and adapt to diverse scenarios. Recent advances in this domain have incorporated generative intelligence to address these drawbacks by uncovering intricate relationships between features. However, two key limitations remain: 1) embedding feature subsets in a continuous space is challenging due to permutation sensitivity, as changes in feature order can introduce biases and weaken the embedding learning process; 2) gradient-based search in the embedding space assumes convexity, which is rarely guaranteed, leading to reduced search effectiveness and suboptimal subsets. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework that can: 1) preserve feature subset knowledge in a continuous embedding space while ensuring permutation invariance; 2) effectively explore the embedding space without relying on strong convex assumptions. For the first objective, we develop an encoder-decoder paradigm to preserve feature selection knowledge into a continuous embedding space. This paradigm captures feature interactions through pairwise relationships within the subset, removing the influence of feature order on the embedding. Moreover, an inducing point mechanism is introduced to accelerate pairwise relationship computations. For the second objective, we employ a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach to guide the exploration of the embedding space. The RL agent effectively navigates the space by balancing multiple objectives. By prioritizing high-potential regions adaptively and eliminating the reliance on convexity assumptions, the RL agent effectively reduces the risk of converging to local optima. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, robustness and explicitness of our model.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |

Learning to Manipulate Object States via Visual Spatial Progress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24129v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most robot manipulation focuses on changing the kinematic state of objects: picking, placing, opening, or rotating them. However, a wide range of real-world manipulation tasks involve a different class of object state change--such as mashing, spreading, or slicing--where the object's physical and visual state evolve progressively without necessarily changing its position. We present SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state change manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common structural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes that can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a transformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially progressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive actionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to generate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance variability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time. These are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for fine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control for fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual goal-conditioned baselines. Our results highlight progress-aware visual representations as a versatile foundation for the broader family of object state manipulation tasks.

| **[When Is Diversity Rewarded in Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09434v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing on multi-agent task allocation problems, we study this question from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$ task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneity Gain Parameter Search (HetGPS), a gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous. Across different environments, we show that HetGPS rediscovers the reward regimes predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both validating HetGPS and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity delivers a measurable benefit.</p></details> |  |

Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and (iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES, WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25, GPQA-Diamond, and MedQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Off-Policy Evaluation in Markov Decision Processes under Weak Distributional Overlap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08201v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Doubly robust methods hold considerable promise for off-policy evaluation in Markov decision processes (MDPs) under sequential ignorability: They have been shown to converge as $1/\sqrt{T}$ with the horizon $T$, to be statistically efficient in large samples, and to allow for modular implementation where preliminary estimation tasks can be executed using standard reinforcement learning techniques. Existing results, however, make heavy use of a strong distributional overlap assumption whereby the stationary distributions of the target policy and the data-collection policy are within a bounded factor of each other -- and this assumption is typically only credible when the state space of the MDP is bounded. In this paper, we re-visit the task of off-policy evaluation in MDPs under a weaker notion of distributional overlap, and introduce a class of truncated doubly robust (TDR) estimators which we find to perform well in this setting. When the distribution ratio of the target and data-collection policies is square-integrable (but not necessarily bounded), our approach recovers the large-sample behavior previously established under strong distributional overlap. When this ratio is not square-integrable, TDR is still consistent but with a slower-than-$1/\sqrt{T}$-rate; furthermore, this rate of convergence is minimax over a class of MDPs defined only using mixing conditions. We validate our approach numerically and find that, in our experiments, appropriate truncation plays a major role in enabling accurate off-policy evaluation when strong distributional overlap does not hold.</p></details> | 59 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Semantic-guided Diverse Decoding for Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23601v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications requiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods primarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation significantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement learning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam search modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to ensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided Diverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances quality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased probability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality thresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD consistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by 1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15% while increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often rely on a single global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning (\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels. Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL} substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\% and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning \texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.</p></details> |  |

This limitation is especially critical in Automated Student Answer Scoring (ASAS), where explainability is essential to justify assessment outcomes. Verbal reinforcement learning offers the potential to generate explicit reflection, but it tends to produce superficial critiques that can harm assessment performance. Existing LLMs also struggle to reliably detect subtle reasoning errors in ASAS tasks. Moreover, manually identifying intermediate reasoning errors is expensive and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we introduce a contrastive reflection synthesis pipeline that generates precise verbal feedback by identifying discrepancies in structure reasoning graph paths. Leveraging these synthetic reflection data, we propose DARS, a Dual-model Reflective Scoring framework featuring a dedicated Critic model trained for effective reflection. DARS achieves strong performance and consistently outperforms existing ASAS baselines across all evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments further provide novel insights into the value of reflection data, framework design, and the scaling behavior of DARS. We release the DARS code at https://github.com/lijiazheng99/DARS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Oral</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically rely on external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on cloud LLM usage. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that the proposed methodology consistently outperforms existing baselines and significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>We pr...</summary><p>We propose a unified post-training framework that integrates routing optimization, enabling the on-device LLM to improve its problem-solving ability while learning routing strategies</p></details> |

Recent extensions to multi-agent RL (MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice, are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods. Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in MARL.</p></details> |  |

Prior work in this setting have established only asymptotic convergence guarantees, leaving open the question of sample complexity. In this work, we address this gap by showing that the robust Bellman operator is a contraction under a carefully constructed semi-norm, and developing a stochastic approximation framework with controlled bias. Our approach builds upon Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) techniques to estimate the robust Bellman operator efficiently. To overcome the infinite expected sample complexity inherent in standard MLMC, we introduce a truncation mechanism based on a geometric distribution, ensuring a finite expected sample complexity while maintaining a small bias that decays exponentially with the truncation level. Our method achieves the order-optimal sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for robust policy evaluation and robust average reward estimation, marking a significant advancement in robust reinforcement learning theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

This static approach limits their ability to adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in flexible and efficient video understanding.</p></details> | Underreview |

While traditional algorithms like PC, GES, and ICA-LiNGAM struggle with these challenges, exhibiting prohibitive energy costs for higher-order nodes and poor scalability beyond 70 nodes, we propose \textbf{GUIDE}, a framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data through a dual-encoder architecture. GUIDE uniquely optimizes computational efficiency, reducing runtime on average by $\approx 42%$ compared to RL-BIC and KCRL methods, while achieving an average $\approx 117%$ improvement in accuracy over both NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually. During training, GUIDE's reinforcement learning agent dynamically balances reward maximization (accuracy) and penalty avoidance (DAG constraints), enabling robust performance across mixed data types and scalability to $\ge 70$ nodes -- a setting where baseline methods fail.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective, much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for alignment with minimal data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curriculum-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Synthesizing Gas-Efficient Financial Derivatives Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23976v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contract-based automation of financial derivatives offers substantial efficiency gains, but its real-world adoption is constrained by the complexity of translating financial specifications into gas-efficient executable code. In particular, generating code that is both functionally correct and economically viable from high-level specifications, such as the Common Domain Model (CDM), remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart contracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a pre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum first trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to gas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate contracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to 35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines. This work presents a viable methodology for the automated synthesis of reliable and economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging the gap between high-level financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, always generating lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and higher inference costs. This paper introduces the Hybrid Policy Optimization (i.e., HiPO), a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to selectively decide when to engage in detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to respond directly (Think-off). Specifically, HiPO combines a hybrid data pipelineproviding paired Think-on and Think-off responseswith a hybrid reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency while avoiding over-reliance on detailed reasoning. Experiments across mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate that HiPO can substantially reduce token length while maintaining or improving accuracy. Finally, we hope HiPO a can be a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in real-world, resource-sensitive settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Advantage Estimation for Reinforcement Learning in Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23962v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length, have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task, enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. Doctor integrates the strengths of supervised learning (SL) and temporal difference (TD) learning by jointly optimizing the action prediction and value estimation. During inference, Doctor introduces a double-check mechanism: actions are first sampled around the desired target returns and then validated with value functions. This ensures more accurate alignment between predicted actions and desired target returns. We evaluate Doctor on the D4RL and EpiCare benchmarks, demonstrating aligned control yields stronger performance and tunable expertise, showing its effectiveness in a wide range of tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), safety filtering, or Model Predictive Control (MPC) either lack strict safety guarantees, suffer from conservatism, or fail to scale effectively. We propose MAD-PINN, a decentralized physics-informed machine learning framework for solving the multi-agent state-constrained optimal control problem (MASC-OCP). Our method leverages an epigraph-based reformulation of SC-OCP to simultaneously capture performance and safety, and approximates its solution via a physics-informed neural network. Scalability is achieved by training the SC-OCP value function on reduced-agent systems and deploying them in a decentralized fashion, where each agent relies only on local observations of its neighbours for decision-making. To further enhance safety and efficiency, we introduce an Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based neighbour selection strategy to prioritize safety-critical interactions, and a receding-horizon policy execution scheme that adapts to dynamic interactions while reducing computational burden. Experiments on multi-agent navigation tasks demonstrate that MAD-PINN achieves superior safety-performance trade-offs, maintains scalability as the number of agents grows, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, 4 Figures, 3 Tables.

Although recent advances have improved the visual quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored. Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10% gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a new reward function that penalizes the robot for being close to or colliding with different entities such as adults, bicyclists, children, and static obstacles, while also encouraging the robot's progress toward the goal. We propose an optimized algorithm that significantly accelerates the training, validation, and testing phases, enabling efficient learning in complex environments.

Recent advancements in mean-field (MF) theory provide scalable solutions by approximating population interactions as a continuum, yet most existing frameworks focus exclusively on either fully cooperative or purely competitive settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MF-MAPPO, a mean-field extension of PPO designed for zero-sum team games that integrate intra-team cooperation with inter-team competition. MF-MAPPO employs a shared actor and a minimally informed critic per team and is trained directly on finite-population simulators, thereby enabling deployment to realistic scenarios with thousands of agents. We further show that MF-MAPPO naturally extends to partially observable settings through a simple gradient-regularized training scheme. Our evaluation utilizes large-scale benchmark scenarios using our own testing simulation platform for MF team games (MFEnv), including offense-defense battlefield tasks as well as variants of population-based rock-paper-scissors games that admit analytical solutions, for benchmarking. Across these benchmarks, MF-MAPPO outperforms existing methods and exhibits complex, heterogeneous behaviors, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining mean-field theory and MARL techniques at scale.</p></details> |  |

However, for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks such as robotic soccer, this end-to-end approach often fails due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in developing embodied world models is not merely increasing the fidelity or size of environments, but scaling their structural complexity through explicit hierarchical scaffolding. We posit that an effective world model for decision-making must model not only the world's physics but also its task semantics. Drawing from a systematic review of 2024 research in low-resource multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Bayesian Strategy Networks (BSNs), with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These methods decompose complex goals into manageable subgoals, creating an intrinsic curriculum that shapes agent learning. We propose that such structured environments are essential for bridging the gap between simple, reactive behaviors and sophisticated, strategic team play. We further extend this principle, proposing that this scaffolding can be generalized to other complex domains and dynamically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which act as generative world models of tasks. By building environments with explicit, composable task layers, we can guide agent exploration more efficiently, generate meaningful learning signals, and ultimately train more capable and general-purpose agents with fewer resources than purely end-to-end approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Embodied World Models for Decision Making (EWM)</p></details> |

In this work, we address both limitations within an imitation learning framework. First, we shift the typical role of Curriculum Learning in MRS, from scalability with the number of robots, to focus on improving long-term coordination. We propose a curriculum strategy that gradually increases the length of expert trajectories during training, stabilizing learning and enhancing the accuracy of long-term behaviors. Second, we introduce a method to approximate the egocentric perception of each robot using only third-person global state demonstrations. Our approach transforms idealized trajectories into locally available observations by filtering neighbors, converting reference frames, and simulating onboard sensor variability. Both contributions are integrated into a physics-informed technique to produce scalable, distributed policies from observations. We conduct experiments across two tasks with varying team sizes and noise levels. Results show that our curriculum improves long-term accuracy, while our perceptual estimation method yields policies that are robust to realistic uncertainty. Together, these strategies enable the learning of robust, distributed controllers from global demonstrations, even in the absence of expert actions or onboard measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the Eight Iberian Robotics Conference, 2025</p></details> |

We propose a robot-centric square spiral layout with a central tramline, enabling simpler motion and more efficient coverage. To exploit this geometry, we develop a navigation stack combining DH-ResNet18 waypoint regression, pixel-to-odometry mapping, A* planning, and model predictive control (MPC). In simulations, the spiral layout yields up to 28% shorter paths and about 25% faster execution for waypoint-based tasks across 500 waypoints than linear layouts, while full-field coverage performance is comparable to an optimised linear U-turn strategy. Multi-robot studies demonstrate efficient coordination on the spirals rule-constrained graph, with a greedy allocator achieving 33-37% lower batch completion times than a Hungarian assignment under our setup. These results highlight the potential of redesigning field geometry to better suit autonomous agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> |

The chassis provides an adjustable track width of 1.42 m to 1.57 m, along with a ground clearance of 0.94 m. The AgriCruiser achieves compact pivot turns with radii of 0.71 m to 0.79 m, enabling efficient headland maneuvers. The platform is designed for the integration of the other subsystems, and in this study, a precision spraying system was implemented to assess its effectiveness in weed management. In twelve flax plots, a single robotic spray pass reduced total weed populations (pigweed and Venice mallow) by 24- to 42-fold compared to manual weeding in four flax plots, while also causing less crop damage. Mobility experiments conducted on concrete, asphalt, gravel, grass, and both wet and dry soil confirmed reliable traversal consistent with torque sizing. The complete chassis can be constructed from commodity T-slot extrusion with minimal machining, resulting in a bill of materials costing approximately $5,000 - $6,000, which enables replication and customization. The mentioned results demonstrate that low-cost, reconfigurable over-the-row robots can achieve effective weed management with reduced crop damage and labor requirements, while providing a versatile foundation for phenotyping, sensing, and other agriculture applications.

While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships. Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs, an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.</p></details> |  |

Although object-centric policies improve sample efficiency, it does not resolve this limitation. In this work, we propose Multi-Stream Generative Policy (MSG), an inference-time composition framework that trains multiple object-centric policies and combines them at inference to improve generalization and sample efficiency. MSG is model-agnostic and inference-only, hence widely applicable to various generative policies and training paradigms. We perform extensive experiments both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that our approach learns high-quality generative policies from as few as five demonstrations, resulting in a 95% reduction in demonstrations, and improves policy performance by 89 percent compared to single-stream approaches. Furthermore, we present comprehensive ablation studies on various composition strategies and provide practical recommendations for deployment. Finally, MSG enables zero-shot object instance transfer. We make our code publicly available at https://msg.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

In documentary filmmaking, they offer dynamic, otherwise unreachable perspectives, transforming how stories are told. Wildlife documentaries especially benefit, yet drones also raise ethical concerns: the risk of disturbing the animals they aim to capture. This paper introduces CineWild, an autonomous UAV framework that combines robotics, cinematography, and ethics. Built on model predictive control, CineWild dynamically adjusts flight paths and camera settings to balance cinematic quality with animal welfare. Key features include adaptive zoom for filming from acoustic and visual safe distances, path-planning that avoids an animal's field of view, and smooth, low-noise maneuvers. CineWild exemplifies interdisciplinary innovation-bridging engineering, visual storytelling, and environmental ethics.

Recent works leverage pre-trained vision-language models to measure the similarity between encoded visual observations and textual instructions, and then train a model to map this similarity to robot actions. However, this two-step approach limits the model to capture the relationship between visual observations and textual instructions, leading to reduced precision in manipulation tasks. We propose to learn visual-textual associations through a self-supervised pretext task: reconstructing a masked goal image conditioned on an input image and textual instructions. This formulation allows the model to learn visual-action representations without robot action supervision. The learned representations can then be fine-tuned for manipulation tasks with only a few demonstrations. We also introduce the \textit{Omni-Object Pick-and-Place} dataset, which consists of annotated robot tabletop manipulation episodes, including 180 object classes and 3,200 instances with corresponding textual instructions. This dataset enables the model to acquire diverse object priors and allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of its generalisation capability across object instances. Experimental results on the five benchmarks, including both simulated and real-robot validations, demonstrate that our method outperforms prior art.</p></details> |  |

Our method utilizes color and depth frames from a monocular RGB-D camera to estimate 3D human keypoints and positions. Principal component analysis (PCA) is then used to determine dominant interaction directions. The shoelace formula is finally applied to compute interest points and engagement areas. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the validity of the proposed method. The results show that our method is capable of recognizing group interactions across different scenarios with varying numbers of individuals. It also achieves high-speed performance, processing each frame in approximately 4 ms on a single-board computer used in robotic systems. The method is implemented as a ROS 2 package making it simple to integrate into existing navigation systems.

| **[Finding an Initial Probe Pose in Teleoperated Robotic Echocardiography via 2D LiDAR-Based 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24867v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Echocardiography is a key imaging modality for cardiac assessment but remains highly operator-dependent, and access to trained sonographers is limited in underserved settings. Teleoperated robotic echocardiography has been proposed as a solution; however, clinical studies report longer examination times than manual procedures, increasing diagnostic delays and operator workload. Automating non-expert tasks, such as automatically moving the probe to an ideal starting pose, offers a pathway to reduce this burden. Prior vision- and depth-based approaches to estimate an initial probe pose are sensitive to lighting, texture, and anatomical variability. We propose a robot-mounted 2D LiDAR-based approach that reconstructs the chest surface in 3D and estimates the initial probe pose automatically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of robot-mounted 2D LiDAR used for 3D reconstruction of a human body surface. Through plane-based extrinsic calibration, the transformation between the LiDAR and robot base frames was estimated with an overall root mean square (RMS) residual of 1.8 mm and rotational uncertainty below 0.2{\deg}. The chest front surface, reconstructed from two linear LiDAR sweeps, was aligned with non-rigid templates to identify an initial probe pose. A mannequin-based study assessing reconstruction accuracy showed mean surface errors of 2.78 +/- 0.21 mm. Human trials (N=5) evaluating the proposed approach found probe initial points typically 20-30 mm from the clinically defined initial point, while the variation across repeated trials on the same subject was less than 4 mm.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Fidelity-Aware Data Composition for Robust Robot Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24797v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale, visually homogeneous datasets can be susceptible to shortcut learning, which impairs their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While generative data augmentation is a common approach to introduce diversity, it presents a subtle challenge: data composition. Naively mixing real and synthetic data can corrupt the learning signal, as this process often prioritizes visual diversity at the expense of information fidelity. This paper suggests that robust generalization depends on principled, fidelity-aware data composition. We introduce Coherent Information Fidelity Tuning (CIFT), a framework that treats data composition as an optimization problem. CIFT uses a practical proxy for Information Fidelity based on the feature-space geometry of a dataset. This enables the identification of a phase transition, termed the Decoherence Point, where training stability degrades. The framework includes a generative engine, Multi-View Video Augmentation (MVAug), to synthesize a causally disentangled data spectrum for this tuning process. Applying CIFT to policy architectures such as $\pi_0$ and Diffusion Policy improves OOD success rates by over 54\%. These results indicate that fidelity-aware composition, beyond data synthesis alone, is an important component for developing robust, general-purpose robots.</p></details> | 33 pages |

Single-sensor systems face inherent limitations: LiDAR provides omnidirectional coverage but lacks rich texture information, while cameras capture high-resolution detail but suffer from restricted field of view. We introduce APREBot (Active Perception System for Reflexive Evasion Robot), a novel framework that integrates reflexive evasion with active hierarchical perception. APREBot strategically combines LiDAR-based omnidirectional scanning with camera-based active focusing, achieving comprehensive environmental awareness essential for agile obstacle avoidance in quadruped robots. We validate APREBot through extensive sim-to-real experiments on a quadruped platform, evaluating diverse obstacle types, trajectories, and approach directions. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in both safety metrics and operational efficiency, highlighting APREBot's potential for dependable autonomy in safety-critical scenarios.

However, many existing approaches neglect the humans post-handover action, relying on assumptions that limit generalizability. To address this gap, we propose LLM-Handover, a novel framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-based reasoning with part segmentation to enable context-aware grasp selection and execution. Given an RGB-D image and a task description, our system infers relevant object parts and selects grasps that optimize post-handover usability. To support evaluation, we introduce a new dataset of 60 household objects spanning 12 categories, each annotated with detailed part labels. We first demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of the used state-of-the-art part segmentation method, in the context of robot-human handovers. Next, we show that LLM-Handover achieves higher grasp success rates and adapts better to post-handover task constraints. During hardware experiments, we achieve a success rate of 83% in a zero-shot setting over conventional and unconventional post-handover tasks. Finally, our user study underlines that our method enables more intuitive, context-aware handovers, with participants preferring it in 86% of cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Stabilizing Humanoid Robot Trajectory Generation via Physics-Informed Learning and Control-Informed Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24697v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent trends in humanoid robot control have successfully employed imitation learning to enable the learned generation of smooth, human-like trajectories from human data. While these approaches make more realistic motions possible, they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability. We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Hangzhou, China, 2025</p></details> |
| **[PoseDiff: A Unified Diffusion Model Bridging Robot Pose Estimation and Video-to-Action Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24591v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI.

| **[U-DiT Policy: U-shaped Diffusion Transformers for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24579v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based methods have been acknowledged as a powerful paradigm for end-to-end visuomotor control in robotics. Most existing approaches adopt a Diffusion Policy in U-Net architecture (DP-U), which, while effective, suffers from limited global context modeling and over-smoothing artifacts. To address these issues, we propose U-DiT Policy, a novel U-shaped Diffusion Transformer framework. U-DiT preserves the multi-scale feature fusion advantages of U-Net while integrating the global context modeling capability of Transformers, thereby enhancing representational power and policy expressiveness. We evaluate U-DiT extensively across both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. In simulation, U-DiT achieves an average performance gain of 10\% over baseline methods and surpasses Transformer-based diffusion policies (DP-T) that use AdaLN blocks by 6\% under comparable parameter budgets. On real-world robotic tasks, U-DiT demonstrates superior generalization and robustness, achieving an average improvement of 22.5\% over DP-U. In addition, robustness and generalization experiments under distractor and lighting variations further highlight the advantages of U-DiT. These results highlight the effectiveness and practical potential of U-DiT Policy as a new foundation for diffusion-based robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting Robot Teams with Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24575v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a framework towards prompting multi-robot teams with high-level tasks using natural language expressions. Our objective is to use the reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in understanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these for multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an individual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and must continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework that possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and semantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time operation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and sequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an RNN, and align its internal states with the semantics of a given task. By training a graph neural network (GNN) control policy that is conditioned on the hidden states of the RNN and the language embeddings, our method enables robots to execute task-relevant actions in a decentralized manner. We present evaluations of this single light-weight interpretable model on various simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks that require sequential and collaborative behavior by the team -- sites.google.com/view/prompting-teams.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCOPE: Semantic Conditioning for Sim2Real Category-Level Object Pose Estimation in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24572v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of 31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to 100\%.

| **[Loosely coupled 4D-Radar-Inertial Odometry for Ground Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17289v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate robot odometry is essential for autonomous navigation. While numerous techniques have been developed based on various sensor suites, odometry estimation using only radar and IMU remains an underexplored area. Radar proves particularly valuable in environments where traditional sensors, like cameras or LiDAR, may struggle, especially in low-light conditions or when faced with environmental challenges like fog, rain or smoke. However, despite its robustness, radar data is noisier and more prone to outliers, requiring specialized processing approaches. In this paper, we propose a graph-based optimization approach using a sliding window for radar-based odometry, designed to maintain robust relationships between poses by forming a network of connections, while keeping computational costs fixed (specially beneficial in long trajectories). Additionally, we introduce an enhancement in the ego-velocity estimation specifically for ground vehicles, both holonomic and non-holonomic, which subsequently improves the direct odometry input required by the optimizer. Finally, we present a comparative study of our approach against existing algorithms, showing how our pure odometry approach inproves the state of art in most trajectories of the NTU4DRadLM dataset, achieving promising results when evaluating key performance metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, 33 references</p></details> |

Particularly, we introduce the Public Good Game (PGG), a model highlighting the tension between individual self-interest and collective well-being. In this work, we present a modified version of the PGG, where three human participants engage in the game with the humanoid robot iCub to assess whether various robot game strategies (e.g., always cooperate, always free ride, and tit-for-tat) can influence the participants' inclination to cooperate. We test our setup during a pilot study with nineteen participants. A preliminary analysis indicates that participants prefer not to invest their money in the common pool, despite they perceive the robot as generous. By conducting this research, we seek to gain valuable insights into the role that robots can play in promoting trust and cohesion during human-robot interactions within group contexts. The results of this study may hold considerable potential for developing social robots capable of fostering trust and cooperation within mixed human-robot groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work presented at the workshop BAILAR in conjunction with IEEE RO-MAN 2023.

| **[Towards agile multi-robot systems in the real world: Fast onboard tracking of active blinking markers for relative localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01172v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel onboard tracking approach enabling vision-based relative localization and communication using Active blinking Marker Tracking (AMT) is introduced in this article. Active blinking markers on multi-robot team members improve the robustness of relative localization for aerial vehicles in tightly coupled multi-robot systems during real-world deployments, while also serving as a resilient communication system. Traditional tracking algorithms struggle with fast-moving blinking markers due to their intermittent appearance in camera frames and the complexity of associating multiple of these markers across consecutive frames. AMT addresses this by using weighted polynomial regression to predict the future appearance of active blinking markers while accounting for uncertainty in the prediction. In outdoor experiments, the AMT approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods in tracking density, accuracy, and complexity. The experimental validation of this novel tracking approach for relative localization and optical communication involved testing motion patterns motivated by our research on agile multi-robot deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided Reinforcement Learning for Omnidirectional 3D Jumping in Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16481v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jumping poses a significant challenge for quadruped robots, despite being crucial for many operational scenarios. While optimisation methods exist for controlling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive knowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in real-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable alternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of sample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and predictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the safety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages physical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining B\'ezier curves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynaMIC: Dynamic Multimodal In-Context Learning Enabled Embodied Robot Counterfactual Resistance Ability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24413v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large pre-trained models based on natural language has breathed new life into robotics development. Extensive research has integrated large models with robots, utilizing the powerful semantic understanding and generation capabilities of large models to facilitate robot control through natural language instructions gradually. However, we found that robots that strictly adhere to human instructions, especially those containing misleading information, may encounter errors during task execution, potentially leading to safety hazards. This resembles the concept of counterfactuals in natural language processing (NLP), which has not yet attracted much attention in robotic research. In an effort to highlight this issue for future studies, this paper introduced directive counterfactuals (DCFs) arising from misleading human directives. We present DynaMIC, a framework for generating robot task flows to identify DCFs and relay feedback to humans proactively. This capability can help robots be sensitive to potential DCFs within a task, thus enhancing the reliability of the execution process. We conducted semantic-level experiments and ablation studies, showcasing the effectiveness of this framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[MimicDreamer: Aligning Human and Robot Demonstrations for Scalable VLA Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22199v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Action (VLA) models derive their generalization capability from diverse training data, yet collecting embodied robot interaction data remains prohibitively expensive. In contrast, human demonstration videos are far more scalable and cost-efficient to collect, and recent studies confirm their effectiveness in training VLA models. However, a significant domain gap persists between human videos and robot-executed videos, including unstable camera viewpoints, visual discrepancies between human hands and robotic arms, and differences in motion dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose MimicDreamer, a framework that turns fast, low-cost human demonstrations into robot-usable supervision by jointly aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to directly support policy training. For visual alignment, we propose H2R Aligner, a video diffusion model that generates high-fidelity robot demonstration videos by transferring motion from human manipulation footage. For viewpoint stabilization, EgoStabilizer is proposed, which canonicalizes egocentric videos via homography and inpaints occlusions and distortions caused by warping. For action alignment, we map human hand trajectories to the robot frame and apply a constrained inverse kinematics solver to produce feasible, low-jitter joint commands with accurate pose tracking. Empirically, VLA models trained purely on our synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real robots. Moreover, scaling training with human data significantly boosts performance compared to models trained solely on real robot data; our approach improves the average success rate by 14.7\% across six representative manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViReSkill: Vision-Grounded Replanning with Skill Memory for LLM-Based Planning in Lifelong Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24219v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Imitation Learning (IL) often adapt slowly to new tasks, whereas recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promise knowledge-rich planning from minimal data. Deploying LLMs/VLMs for motion planning, however, faces two key obstacles: (i) symbolic plans are rarely grounded in scene geometry and object physics, and (ii) model outputs can vary for identical prompts, undermining execution reliability. We propose ViReSkill, a framework that pairs vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory for accumulation and reuse. When a failure occurs, the replanner generates a new action sequence conditioned on the current scene, tailored to the observed state. On success, the executed plan is stored as a reusable skill and replayed in future encounters without additional calls to LLMs/VLMs. This feedback loop enables autonomous continual learning: each attempt immediately expands the skill set and stabilizes subsequent executions. We evaluate ViReSkill on simulators such as LIBERO and RLBench as well as on a physical robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate, demonstrating robust sim-to-real generalization.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches face a dilemma: imitation policy learning demands extensive demonstrations to cover task variations, while modular methods often lack flexibility in dynamic scenes. We introduce VLBiMan, a framework that derives reusable skills from a single human example through task-aware decomposition, preserving invariant primitives as anchors while dynamically adapting adjustable components via vision-language grounding. This adaptation mechanism resolves scene ambiguities caused by background changes, object repositioning, or visual clutter without policy retraining, leveraging semantic parsing and geometric feasibility constraints. Moreover, the system inherits human-like hybrid control capabilities, enabling mixed synchronous and asynchronous use of both arms. Extensive experiments validate VLBiMan across tool-use and multi-object tasks, demonstrating: (1) a drastic reduction in demonstration requirements compared to imitation baselines, (2) compositional generalization through atomic skill splicing for long-horizon tasks, (3) robustness to novel but semantically similar objects and external disturbances, and (4) strong cross-embodiment transfer, showing that skills learned from human demonstrations can be instantiated on different robotic platforms without retraining. By bridging human priors with vision-language anchored adaptation, our work takes a step toward practical and versatile dual-arm manipulation in unstructured settings.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Blast Hole Seeking and Dipping -- The Navigation and Perception Framework in a Mine Site Inspection Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13785v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site and detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to be inspected internally to assess subsurface material types and drill quality, in order to significantly reduce downstream material handling costs. Manual hole inspection is slow and expensive, limited in its ability to capture the geometric and geological characteristics of holes. This has been the motivation for the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - "DIPPeR". In this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a robust perception and navigation framework that provides streamlined blasthole seeking, tracking and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. To address challenges in the surface mining environment, where GPS and odometry data are noisy without RTK correction, we adopt a proximity-based adaptive navigation approach, enabling the vehicle to dynamically adjust its operations based on detected target availability and localisation accuracy. For perception, we process LiDAR data to extract the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above ground, then project the 3D cone points into a virtual depth image to form accurate 2D segmentation of hole regions. To ensure continuous target-tracking as the robot approaches the goal, our system automatically adjusts projection parameters to preserve consistent hole image appearance. At the vicinity of the hole, we apply least squares circle fitting with non-maximum candidate suppression to achieve accurate hole detection and collision-free down-hole sensor placement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field trials.

An example is the stacking of containers with hidden objects inside, which involves reasoning over hidden physics properties such as weight and stability. To this end, this paper proposes to use multimodal LLMs as high-level planners for such long-horizon robotic stacking tasks. The LLM takes multimodal inputs for each object to stack and infers the current best stacking sequence by reasoning over stacking preferences. Furthermore, in order to enable the LLM to reason over multiple preferences at the same time without giving explicit instructions, we propose to create a custom dataset considering stacking preferences including weight, stability, size, and footprint, to fine-tune the LLM. Compared to the pretrained LLM with prompt tuning, we demonstrate the improved stacking completion of the LLM fine-tuned with our custom dataset via large-scale simulation evaluation. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework for the long-horizon stacking task on a real humanoid robot in an online manner.</p></details> |  |

Many systems require either environment-specific policy training or depend on fixed prompts and single-shot code generation, leading to limited transferability and manual re-tuning. We introduce Memory Transfer Planning (MTP), a framework that leverages successful control-code examples from different environments as procedural knowledge, using them as in-context guidance for LLM-driven planning. Specifically, MTP (i) generates an initial plan and code using LLMs, (ii) retrieves relevant successful examples from a code memory, and (iii) contextually adapts the retrieved code to the target setting for re-planning without updating model parameters. We evaluate MTP on RLBench, CALVIN, and a physical robot, demonstrating effectiveness beyond simulation. Across these settings, MTP consistently improved success rate and adaptability compared with fixed-prompt code generation, naive retrieval, and memory-free re-planning. Furthermore, in hardware experiments, leveraging a memory constructed in simulation proved effective. MTP provides a practical approach that exploits procedural knowledge to realize robust LLM-based planning across diverse robotic manipulation scenarios, enhancing adaptability to novel environments and bridging simulation and real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel deep reinforcement learning approach that improves robot navigation and interaction with different types of agents and obstacles based on specific safety requirements. Our approach uses information about the entity types, improving collision avoidance and ensuring safer navigation. We introduce a new reward function that penalizes the robot for being close to or colliding with different entities such as adults, bicyclists, children, and static obstacles, while also encouraging the robot's progress toward the goal. We propose an optimized algorithm that significantly accelerates the training, validation, and testing phases, enabling efficient learning in complex environments. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art navigation and collision avoidance methods.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[An Empirical Study on the Computation Budget of Co-Optimization of Robot Design and Control in Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08621v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design (shape) of a robot is usually decided before the control is implemented. This might limit how well the design is adapted to a task, as the suitability of the design is given by how well the robot performs in the task, which requires both a design and a controller. The co-optimization or simultaneous optimization of the design and control of robots addresses this limitation by producing a design and control that are both adapted to the task. This paper investigates some of the challenges inherent in the co-optimization of design and control in simulation. The results show that reducing how well the controllers are trained during the co-optimization process significantly improves the robot's performance when considering a second phase in which the controller for the best design is retrained with additional resources. In addition, the results demonstrate that the computation budget allocated to training the controller for each design influences design complexity, with simpler designs associated with lower training budgets. This paper experimentally studies key questions discussed in other works in the literature on the co-optimization of design and control of robots in simulation in four different co-optimization problems.</p></details> |  |

| **[High-Precision Climbing Robot Localization Using Planar Array UWB/GPS/IMU/Barometer Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23801v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the need for high-precision localization of climbing robots in complex high-altitude environments, this paper proposes a multi-sensor fusion system that overcomes the limitations of single-sensor approaches. Firstly, the localization scenarios and the problem model are analyzed. An integrated architecture of Attention Mechanism-based Fusion Algorithm (AMFA) incorporating planar array Ultra-Wideband (UWB), GPS, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and barometer is designed to handle challenges such as GPS occlusion and UWB Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) problem. Then, End-to-end neural network inference models for UWB and barometer are developed, along with a multimodal attention mechanism for adaptive data fusion. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is applied to refine the trajectory, improving accuracy and robustness. Finally, real-world experiments show that the method achieves 0.48 m localization accuracy and lower MAX error of 1.50 m, outperforming baseline algorithms such as GPS/INS-EKF and demonstrating stronger robustness.</p></details> |  |

To be effective, such robots must follow the target while ensuring safety and comfort for both the target and surrounding people. In this work, we present the first end-to-end study of RPF, which (i) surveys representative scenarios, motion-planning methods, and evaluation metrics with a focus on safety and comfort; (ii) introduces Follow-Bench, a unified benchmark simulating diverse scenarios, including various target trajectory patterns, dynamic-crowd flows, and environmental layouts; and (iii) re-implements six popular RPF planners, ensuring that both safety and comfort are systematically considered. Moreover, we evaluate the two highest-performing planners from our benchmark on a differential-drive robot to provide insights into real-world deployment. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments provide quantitative insights into the safety-comfort trade-offs of existing planners, while revealing open challenges and future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://follow-bench.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[MDCPP: Multi-robot Dynamic Coverage Path Planning for Workload Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23705v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) addresses the problem of computing paths for multiple robots to effectively cover a large area of interest. Conventional approaches to MCPP typically assume that robots move at fixed velocities, which is often unrealistic in real-world applications where robots must adapt their speeds based on the specific coverage tasks assigned to them.Consequently, conventional approaches often lead to imbalanced workload distribution among robots and increased completion time for coverage tasks. To address this, we introduce a novel Multi-robot Dynamic Coverage Path Planning (MDCPP) algorithm for complete coverage in two-dimensional environments. MDCPP dynamically estimates each robot's remaining workload by approximating the target distribution with Gaussian mixture models, and assigns coverage regions using a capacity-constrained Voronoi diagram. We further develop a distributed implementation of MDCPP for range-constrained robotic networks. Simulation results validate the efficacy of MDCPP, showing qualitative improvements and superior performance compared to an existing sweeping algorithm, and a quantifiable impact of communication range on coverage efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certifiably Optimal State Estimation and Robot Calibration Using Trace-Constrained SDP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23656v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many nonconvex problems in robotics can be relaxed into convex formulations via semidefinite programming (SDP), which offers the advantage of global optimality. The practical quality of these solutions, however, critically depends on achieving rank-1 matrices, a condition that typically requires additional tightening. In this work, we focus on trace-constrained SDPs, where the decision variables are positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices with fixed trace values. These additional constraints not only capture important structural properties but also facilitate first-order methods for recovering rank-1 solutions. We introduce customized fixed-trace variables and constraints to represent common robotic quantities such as rotations and translations, which can be exactly recovered when the corresponding variables are rank-1. To further improve practical performance, we develop a gradient-based refinement procedure that projects relaxed SDP solutions toward rank-1, low-cost candidates, which can then be certified for global optimality via the dual problem. We demonstrate that many robotics tasks can be expressed within this trace-constrained SDP framework, and showcase its effectiveness through simulations in perspective-n-point (PnP) estimation, hand-eye calibration, and dual-robot system calibration. To support broader use, we also introduce a modular ``virtual robot'' abstraction that simplifies modeling across different problem settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeLoM: Hierarchical Learning for Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation in Hexapod Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23651v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots in real-world environments are often required to move/manipulate objects comparable in weight to their own bodies. Compared to grasping and carrying, pushing provides a more straightforward and efficient non-prehensile manipulation strategy, avoiding complex grasp design while leveraging direct contact to regulate an object's pose. Achieving effective pushing, however, demands both sufficient manipulation forces and the ability to maintain stability, which is particularly challenging when dealing with heavy or irregular objects. To address these challenges, we propose HeLoM, a learning-based hierarchical whole-body manipulation framework for a hexapod robot that exploits coordinated multi-limb control. Inspired by the cooperative strategies of multi-legged insects, our framework leverages redundant contact points and high degrees of freedom to enable dynamic redistribution of contact forces. HeLoM's high-level planner plans pushing behaviors and target object poses, while its low-level controller maintains locomotion stability and generates dynamically consistent joint actions. Our policies trained in simulation are directly deployed on real robots without additional fine-tuning. This design allows the robot to maintain balance while exerting continuous and controllable pushing forces through coordinated foreleg interaction and supportive hind-leg propulsion. We validate the effectiveness of HeLoM through both simulation and real-world experiments. Results show that our framework can stably push boxes of varying sizes and unknown physical properties to designated goal poses in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizable Coarse-to-Fine Robot Manipulation via Language-Aligned 3D Keypoints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23575v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical coarse-to-fine policy, where a coarse branch predicts a region of interest to guide a fine-grained action predictor, has demonstrated significant potential in robotic 3D manipulation tasks by especially enhancing sample efficiency and enabling more precise manipulation. However, even augmented with pre-trained models, these hierarchical policies still suffer from generalization issues. To enhance generalization to novel instructions and environment variations, we propose Coarse-to-fine Language-Aligned manipulation Policy (CLAP), a framework that integrates three key components: 1) task decomposition, 2) VLM fine-tuning for 3D keypoint prediction, and 3) 3D-aware representation. Through comprehensive experiments in simulation and on a real robot, we demonstrate its superior generalization capability. Specifically, on GemBench, a benchmark designed for evaluating generalization, our approach achieves a 12\% higher average success rate than the SOTA method while using only 1/5 of the training trajectories. In real-world experiments, our policy, trained on only 10 demonstrations, successfully generalizes to novel instructions and environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[High Torque Density PCB Axial Flux Permanent Magnet Motor for Micro Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23561v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quasi-direct-drive (QDD) actuation is transforming legged and manipulator robots by eliminating high-ratio gearboxes, yet it demands motors that deliver very high torque at low speed within a thin, disc-shaped joint envelope. Axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) machines meet these geometric and torque requirements, but scaling them below a 20mm outer diameter is hampered by poor copper fill in conventional wound stators, inflating resistance and throttling continuous torque. This paper introduces a micro-scale AFPM motor that overcomes these limitations through printed-circuit-board (PCB) windings fabricated with advanced IC-substrate high-density interconnect (HDI) technology. The resulting 48-layer stator-formed by stacking four 12-layer HDI modules-achieves a record 45\% copper fill in a package only 5mm thick and 19mm in diameter. We perform comprehensive electromagnetic and thermal analyses to inform the motor design, then fabricate a prototype whose performance characteristics are experimentally verified.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Whole-Body Manipulation with a Large-Scale Soft Robotic Torso via Guided Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23556v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-body manipulation is a powerful yet underexplored approach that enables robots to interact with large, heavy, or awkward objects using more than just their end-effectors. Soft robots, with their inherent passive compliance, are particularly well-suited for such contact-rich manipulation tasks, but their uncertainties in kinematics and dynamics pose significant challenges for simulation and control. In this work, we address this challenge with a simulation that can run up to 350x real time on a single thread in MuJoCo and provide a detailed analysis of the critical tradeoffs between speed and accuracy for this simulation. Using this framework, we demonstrate a successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of a learned whole-body manipulation policy, achieving an 88% success rate on the Baloo hardware platform. We show that guiding RL with a simple motion primitive is critical to this success where standard reward shaping methods struggled to produce a stable and successful policy for whole-body manipulation. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the learned policy does not simply mimic the motion primitive. It exhibits beneficial reactive behavior, such as re-grasping and perturbation recovery. We analyze and contrast this learned policy against an open-loop baseline to show that the policy can also exhibit aggressive over-corrections under perturbation. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of forceful, six-DoF whole-body manipulation using two continuum soft arms on a large-scale platform (10 kg payloads), with zero-shot policy transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics for review</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose a novel decentralized framework that enables robots to request and provide help. The process begins when a robot detects a conflict and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to decide whether external assistance is required. If so, it crafts and broadcasts a natural language (NL) help request. Potential helper robots reason over the request and respond with offers of assistance, including information about the effect on their ongoing tasks. Helper reasoning is implemented via an LLM grounded in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) using a Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar, ensuring syntactically valid NL-to-STL translations, which are then solved as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Finally, the requester robot selects a helper by reasoning over the expected increase in system-level total task completion time. We evaluated our framework through experiments comparing different helper-selection strategies and found that considering multiple offers allows the requester to minimize added makespan. Our approach significantly outperforms heuristics such as selecting the nearest available candidate helper robot, and achieves performance comparable to a centralized "Oracle" baseline but without heavy information demands.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Decoding for Robotics Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01728v3)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. Trained on vast datasets of simulated and real-world trajectories, these models map multimodal observations directly to action sequences for physical execution. Despite promising real-world capabilities, these models are still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral correctness. We address this gap by introducing SafeDec, a constrained decoding framework for autoregressive, robot foundation models that enforces invariant safety specifications on candidate action trajectories. Task-specific safety rules are expressed as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulas and are enforced at inference time with minimal overhead. Our method ensures that generated actions provably satisfy STL specifications under assumed dynamics at runtime without retraining , while remaining agnostic of the underlying policy. We evaluate SafeDec on tasks from the CHORES benchmark for state-of-the-art generalist policies (e.g., SPOC, Flare, PoliFormer) across hundreds of procedurally generated environments and show that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe actions but also for conditional action generation.

| **[MARG: MAstering Risky Gap Terrains for Legged Robots with Elevation Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20036v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) controllers for quadrupedal locomotion have demonstrated impressive performance on challenging terrains, allowing robots to execute complex skills such as climbing, running, and jumping. However, existing blind locomotion controllers often struggle to ensure safety and efficient traversal through risky gap terrains, which are typically highly complex, requiring robots to perceive terrain information and select appropriate footholds during locomotion accurately. Meanwhile, existing perception-based controllers still present several practical limitations, including a complex multi-sensor deployment system and expensive computing resource requirements. This paper proposes a DRL controller named MAstering Risky Gap Terrains (MARG), which integrates terrain maps and proprioception to dynamically adjust the action and enhance the robot's stability in these tasks. During the training phase, our controller accelerates policy optimization by selectively incorporating privileged information (e.g., center of mass, friction coefficients) that are available in simulation but unmeasurable directly in real-world deployments due to sensor limitations. We also designed three foot-related rewards to encourage the robot to explore safe footholds. More importantly, a terrain map generation (TMG) model is proposed to reduce the drift existing in mapping and provide accurate terrain maps using only one LiDAR, providing a foundation for zero-shot transfer of the learned policy. The experimental results indicate that MARG maintains stability in various risky terrain tasks.</p></details> |  |

It offers a modular architecture that integrates on-demand procedural generation with massively parallel simulation environments to support the creation of vast and diverse training distributions for learning-based agents. To ground research and enable direct comparison, the framework includes a comprehensive suite of benchmark tasks that span a wide range of mission-relevant scenarios. We establish performance baselines using standard reinforcement learning algorithms and present a series of experimental case studies that investigate key challenges in generalization, end-to-end learning, adaptive control, and sim-to-real transfer. Our results reveal insights into the limitations of current methods and demonstrate the utility of the framework in producing policies capable of real-world operation.

Current research has made significant progress in addressing environmental exploration, information search, and target tracking problems, but has yet to establish a framework for simultaneously optimizing these tasks in complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm framework that integrates three control strategies: a frontier-based exploration strategy, a guaranteed coverage strategy based on Lloyd's algorithm, and a sensor-based multi-target tracking strategy. By incorporating these three strategies, the proposed algorithm balances coverage search and high-precision active tracking during exploration. Our approach is validated through a series of MATLAB simulations, demonstrating validity and superiority over standard approaches.</p></details> |  |

Data-driven defenses such as jailbreak classifiers show promise, yet they struggle to generalize in domains where specialized datasets are scarce, limiting their effectiveness in robotics and other safety-critical contexts. To address this gap, we introduce J-DAPT, a lightweight framework for multimodal jailbreak detection through attention-based fusion and domain adaptation. J-DAPT integrates textual and visual embeddings to capture both semantic intent and environmental grounding, while aligning general-purpose jailbreak datasets with domain-specific reference data. Evaluations across autonomous driving, maritime robotics, and quadruped navigation show that J-DAPT boosts detection accuracy to nearly 100% with minimal overhead. These results demonstrate that J-DAPT provides a practical defense for securing VLMs in robotic applications.

| **[Simulated Annealing for Multi-Robot Ergodic Information Acquisition Using Graph-Based Discretization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23214v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the goals of active information acquisition using multi-robot teams is to keep the relative uncertainty in each region at the same level to maintain identical acquisition quality (e.g., consistent target detection) in all the regions. To achieve this goal, ergodic coverage can be used to assign the number of samples according to the quality of observation, i.e., sampling noise levels. However, the noise levels are unknown to the robots. Although this noise can be estimated from samples, the estimates are unreliable at first and can generate fluctuating values. The main contribution of this paper is to use simulated annealing to generate the target sampling distribution, starting from uniform and gradually shifting to an estimated optimal distribution, by varying the coldness parameter of a Boltzmann distribution with the estimated sampling entropy as energy. Simulation results show a substantial improvement of both transient and asymptotic entropy compared to both uniform and direct-ergodic searches. Finally, a demonstration is performed with a TurtleBot swarm system to validate the physical applicability of the algorithm.</p></details> |  |

In these scenarios, mission-critical traffic follows a strict deadline-constrained communication pattern: commands must arrive within defined QoS deadlines, otherwise late arrivals can degrade performance or destabilize control loops.In this work, we demonstrate on a real-time SDR platform that CSMA, widely adopted in robotic communications,suffers severe degradation under high robot traffic loads, with contention-induced collisions and delays disrupting the on-time arrival of mission-critical packets. To address this problem, we propose an IEEE 802.11-compatible hybrid TDMA/CSMA protocol that combines TDMA's deterministic slot scheduling with CSMA's adaptability for heterogeneous robot traffic.The protocol achieves collision-free, low-latency mission-critical command delivery and IEEE 802.11 compatibility through the synergistic integration of sub-microsecond PTP-based slot synchronization-essential for establishing precise timing for TDMA, a three-session superframe with dynamic TDMA allocation for structured and adaptable traffic management,and beacon-NAV protection to preemptively secure these critical communication sessions from interference. Emulation experiments on real-time SDR testbed and Robot Operating System (ROS) simulation show that the proposed protocol reduces missed-deadline errors by 93% compared to the CSMA baseline. In high-speed robot path-tracking ROS simulations, the protocol lowers Root Mean Square (RMS) trajectory error by up to 90% compared with a CSMA baseline, all while maintaining throughput for non-critical traffic within +-2%.</p></details> |  |

We ask whether natural language can serve as feedback, an error reasoning signal that helps embodied agents diagnose what went wrong and correct course. We introduce LAGEA (Language Guided Embodied Agents), a framework that turns episodic, schema-constrained reflections from a vision language model (VLM) into temporally grounded guidance for reinforcement learning. LAGEA summarizes each attempt in concise language, localizes the decisive moments in the trajectory, aligns feedback with visual state in a shared representation, and converts goal progress and feedback agreement into bounded, step-wise shaping rewardswhose influence is modulated by an adaptive, failure-aware coefficient. This design yields dense signals early when exploration needs direction and gracefully recedes as competence grows. On the Meta-World MT10 embodied manipulation benchmark, LAGEA improves average success over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 9.0% on random goals and 5.3% on fixed goals, while converging faster. These results support our hypothesis: language, when structured and grounded in time, is an effective mechanism for teaching robots to self-reflect on mistakes and make better choices. Code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

Yet, policies remain brittle when applied to articulated mechanisms due to contact-rich dynamics and under-modeled joint phenomena such as friction, stiction, backlash, and clearances. We address this challenge through dexterous in-hand manipulation of articulated tools using a robotic hand with reduced articulation and kinematic redundancy relative to the human hand. Our controller augments a simulation-trained base policy with a sensor-driven refinement learned from hardware demonstrations, conditioning on proprioception and target articulation states while fusing whole-hand tactile and force feedback with the policy's internal action intent via cross-attention-based integration. This design enables online adaptation to instance-specific articulation properties, stabilizes contact interactions, regulates internal forces, and coordinates coupled-link motion under perturbations. We validate our approach across a diversity of real-world examples, including scissors, pliers, minimally invasive surgical tools, and staplers. We achieve robust transfer from simulation to hardware, improved disturbance resilience, and generalization to previously unseen articulated tools, thereby reducing reliance on precise physical modeling in contact-rich settings.</p></details> |  |

Disassembly is among the most critical processes in EoL phone recycling. However, it relies heavily on human labor due to product variability. Consequently, the manual process is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a low-cost, easily deployable automated and selective disassembly and sorting system for EoL phones, consisting of three subsystems: an adaptive cutting system, a vision-based robotic sorting system, and a battery removal system. The system can process over 120 phones per hour with an average disassembly success rate of 98.9%, efficiently delivering selected high-value components to downstream processing. It provides a reliable and scalable automated solution to the pressing challenge of EoL phone disassembly. Additionally, the automated system can enhance disassembly economics, converting a previously unprofitable process into one that yields a net profit per unit weight of EoL phones.</p></details> |  |

Simulation results show improved robustness and adaptability compared to existing control schemes.</p></details> |  |

Recently, passive observation using extended reality (XR) headsets has shown promise for egocentric demonstration collection, yet current approaches require additional hardware, complex calibration, or constrained recording conditions that limit scalability and usability. We present ARMimic, a novel framework that overcomes these limitations with a lightweight and hardware-minimal setup for scalable, robot-free data collection using only a consumer XR headset and a stationary workplace camera. ARMimic integrates egocentric hand tracking, augmented reality (AR) robot overlays, and real-time depth sensing to ensure collision-aware, kinematically feasible demonstrations. A unified imitation learning pipeline is at the core of our method, treating both human and virtual robot trajectories as interchangeable, which enables policies that generalize across different embodiments and environments. We validate ARMimic on two manipulation tasks, including challenging long-horizon bowl stacking. In our experiments, ARMimic reduces demonstration time by 50% compared to teleoperation and improves task success by 11% over ACT, a state-of-the-art baseline trained on teleoperated data. Our results demonstrate that ARMimic enables safe, seamless, and in-the-wild data collection, offering great potential for scalable robot learning in diverse real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

We consider environments divided into non-overlapping regions with distinct spatial and temporal dynamics, termed non-uniform spatiotemporal environments. Gaussian Processes (GPs) can be used to estimate these fields. The GP model depends on a kernel that encodes how the field co-varies in space and time, with its spatial and temporal lengthscales defining the correlation. Hence, when these lengthscales are incorrect or do not correspond to the actual field, the estimates of uncertainty can be highly inaccurate. Existing GP methods often assume one global lengthscale or update only periodically; some allow spatial variation but ignore temporal changes. To address these limitations, we propose a two-phase framework for multi-robot field estimation. Phase 1 uses a variogram-driven planner to learn region-specific spatial lengthscales. Phase 2 employs an allocation strategy that reassigns robots based on the current uncertainty, and updates sampling as temporal lengthscales are refined. For encoding uncertainty, we utilize clarity, an information metric from our earlier work. We evaluate the proposed method across diverse environments and provide convergence analysis for spatial lengthscale estimation, along with dynamic regret bounds quantifying the gap to the oracle's allocation sequence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to American Control Conference (ACC) 2026</p></details> |
| **[Teleoperator-Aware and Safety-Critical Adaptive Nonlinear MPC for Shared Autonomy in Obstacle Avoidance of Legged Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22815v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safe and effective collaboration between humans and autonomous legged robots is a fundamental challenge in shared autonomy, particularly for teleoperated systems navigating cluttered environments. Conventional shared-control approaches often rely on fixed blending strategies that fail to capture the dynamics of legged locomotion and may compromise safety. This paper presents a teleoperator-aware, safety-critical, adaptive nonlinear model predictive control (ANMPC) framework for shared autonomy of quadrupedal robots in obstacle-avoidance tasks. The framework employs a fixed arbitration weight between human and robot actions but enhances this scheme by modeling the human input with a noisily rational Boltzmann model, whose parameters are adapted online using a projected gradient descent (PGD) law from observed joystick commands. Safety is enforced through control barrier function (CBF) constraints integrated into a computationally efficient NMPC, ensuring forward invariance of safe sets despite uncertainty in human behavior. The control architecture is hierarchical: a high-level CBF-based ANMPC (10 Hz) generates blended human-robot velocity references, a mid-level dynamics-aware NMPC (60 Hz) enforces reduced-order single rigid body (SRB) dynamics to track these references, and a low-level nonlinear whole-body controller (500 Hz) imposes the full-order dynamics via quadratic programming to track the mid-level trajectories. Extensive numerical and hardware experiments, together with a user study, on a Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot validate the framework, demonstrating real-time obstacle avoidance, online learning of human intent parameters, and safe teleoperator collaboration.</p></details> |  |

One such activity is the development of standards and guidelines to specify modularization practices at the component-level for individual modules (e.g., perception, grasp planning, motion planning) and integrations of components that form robot manipulation capabilities at the pipeline-level. This paper briefly reviews our work-in-progress to date to (1) build repositories of open-source products to identify common characteristics of each component in the pipeline, (2) investigate existing modular pipelines to glean best practices, and (3) develop new modular pipelines that advance prior work while abiding by the proposed standards and guidelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 3rd AAAI Fall Symposium on Unifying Representations for Robot Application Development (UR-RAD), Arlington, VA, USA, November 2025</p></details> |

In DAWN, both the high-level and low-level controllers are modeled as diffusion processes, yielding a fully trainable, end-to-end system with interpretable intermediate motion abstractions. DAWN achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging CALVIN benchmark, demonstrating strong multi-task performance, and further validates its effectiveness on MetaWorld. Despite the substantial domain gap between simulation and reality and limited real-world data, we demonstrate reliable real-world transfer with only minimal finetuning, illustrating the practical viability of diffusion-based motion abstractions for robotic control. Our results show the effectiveness of combining diffusion modeling with motion-centric representations as a strong baseline for scalable and robust robot learning.

Over the past decade, deep learning has gained traction in this field, with most existing approaches relying on multimodal inputs, such as RGB combined with depth (RGB-D), to classify time-sequence windows of sensory data as interactive or non-interactive. In contrast, we propose a novel RGB-only pipeline for predicting human interaction intent with frame-level precision, enabling faster robot responses and improved service quality. A key challenge in intent prediction is the class imbalance inherent in real-world HRI datasets, which can hinder the model's training and generalization. To address this, we introduce MINT-RVAE, a synthetic sequence generation method, along with new loss functions and training strategies that enhance generalization on out-of-sample data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUROC: 0.95) outperforming prior works (AUROC: 0.90-0.912), while requiring only RGB input and supporting precise frame onset prediction. Finally, to support future research, we openly release our new dataset with frame-level labeling of human interaction intent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mobi-$π$: Mobilizing Your Robot Learning Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23692v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and remains compatible with them. We propose a novel approach for policy mobilization that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to identify optimal robot poses. To understand policy mobilization in more depth, we also introduce the Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, and (3) visualization tools for analysis. In both our developed simulation task suite and the real world, we show that our approach outperforms baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for policy mobilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>CoRL ...</summary><p>CoRL 2025.

Hence, robots are expected to make reasonable decisions and communicate them to humans when needed. In this article, the focus is on an approach to modeling and reasoning about the comparison of two competing plans, so that robots can later explain the divergent result. First, a novel ontological model is proposed to formalize and reason about the differences between competing plans, enabling the classification of the most appropriate one (e.g., the shortest, the safest, the closest to human preferences, etc.). This work also investigates the limitations of a baseline algorithm for ontology-based explanatory narration. To address these limitations, a novel algorithm is presented, leveraging divergent knowledge between plans and facilitating the construction of contrastive narratives. Through empirical evaluation, it is observed that the explanations excel beyond the baseline method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version was submitted to the journal Information Sciences and is under review since October 2024</p></details> |

We introduce a market-based approach that optimizes the joint team objective while explicitly capturing coupled rewards between robots, offering a polynomial-time solution in decentralized settings with strict communication assumptions. Comparative experiments against benchmark algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the challenges of incorporating coupled rewards in a decentralized formulation.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[An Ontology for Unified Modeling of Tasks, Actions, Environments, and Capabilities in Personal Service Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22434v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personal service robots are increasingly used in domestic settings to assist older adults and people requiring support. Effective operation involves not only physical interaction but also the ability to interpret dynamic environments, understand tasks, and choose appropriate actions based on context. This requires integrating both hardware components (e.g. sensors, actuators) and software systems capable of reasoning about tasks, environments, and robot capabilities. Frameworks such as the Robot Operating System (ROS) provide open-source tools that help connect low-level hardware with higher-level functionalities. However, real-world deployments remain tightly coupled to specific platforms. As a result, solutions are often isolated and hard-coded, limiting interoperability, reusability, and knowledge sharing. Ontologies and knowledge graphs offer a structured way to represent tasks, environments, and robot capabilities. Existing ontologies, such as the Socio-physical Model of Activities (SOMA) and the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE), provide models for activities, spatial relationships, and reasoning structures. However, they often focus on specific domains and do not fully capture the connection between environment, action, robot capabilities, and system-level integration. In this work, we propose the Ontology for roBOts and acTions (OntoBOT), which extends existing ontologies to provide a unified representation of tasks, actions, environments, and capabilities. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we unify these aspects into a cohesive ontology to support formal reasoning about task execution, and (2) we demonstrate its generalizability by evaluating competency questions across four embodied agents - TIAGo, HSR, UR3, and Stretch - showing how OntoBOT enables context-aware reasoning, task-oriented execution, and knowledge sharing in service robotics.</p></details> |  |

However, collecting large-scale real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation (EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent, geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground, background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a 200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in boosting policy generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReLAM: Learning Anticipation Model for Rewarding Visual Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22402v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning (RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However, such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound. Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboView-Bias: Benchmarking Visual Bias in Embodied Agents for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22356v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety and reliability of embodied agents rely on accurate and unbiased visual perception. However, existing benchmarks mainly emphasize generalization and robustness under perturbations, while systematic quantification of visual bias remains scarce. This gap limits a deeper understanding of how perception influences decision-making stability. To address this issue, we propose RoboView-Bias, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically quantify visual bias in robotic manipulation, following a principle of factor isolation. Leveraging a structured variant-generation framework and a perceptual-fairness validation protocol, we create 2,127 task instances that enable robust measurement of biases induced by individual visual factors and their interactions. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate three representative embodied agents across two prevailing paradigms and report three key findings: (i) all agents exhibit significant visual biases, with camera viewpoint being the most critical factor; (ii) agents achieve their highest success rates on highly saturated colors, indicating inherited visual preferences from underlying VLMs; and (iii) visual biases show strong, asymmetric coupling, with viewpoint strongly amplifying color-related bias. Finally, we demonstrate that a mitigation strategy based on a semantic grounding layer substantially reduces visual bias by approximately 54.5\% on MOKA. Our results highlight that systematic analysis of visual bias is a prerequisite for developing safe and reliable general-purpose embodied agents.</p></details> |  |

Most ground mobile planetary exploration robots use wheeled or modified wheeled platforms. Although extraordinarily successful at completing intended mission goals, because of the limitations of wheeled locomotion, they have been largely limited to benign, solid terrain and avoided extreme terrain with loose soil/sand and large rocks. Unfortunately, such challenging terrain is often scientifically interesting for planetary geology. Although many animals traverse such terrain at ease, robots have not matched their performance and robustness. This is in major part due to a lack of fundamental understanding of how effective locomotion can be generated from controlled interaction with complex terrain on the same level of flight aerodynamics and underwater vehicle hydrodynamics. Early fundamental understanding of legged and limbless locomotor-ground interaction has already enabled stable and efficient bio-inspired robot locomotion on relatively flat ground with small obstacles. Recent progress in the new field of terradynamics of locomotor-terrain interaction begins to reveal the principles of bio-inspired locomotion on loose soil/sand and over large obstacles. Multi-legged and limbless platforms using terradynamics insights hold the promise for serving as robust alternative platforms for traversing extreme extraterrestrial terrain and expanding our reach in planetary exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-CAP: A Multi-Robot Connectivity-Aware Hierarchical Coverage Path Planning Algorithm for Unknown Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14941v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time, total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner in achieving these performance gains.</p></details> |  |

While conventional fall prevention systems typically rely on post-fall detection or reactive alerts, they also often suffer from high false positive rates and fail to address the underlying patient needs that lead to bed-exit attempts. This paper presents a novel system architecture that leverages the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) to orchestrate human-robot-robot interaction for proactive and personalized patient assistance. The system integrates a privacy-preserving thermal sensing model capable of real-time bed-exit prediction, with two coordinated robotic agents that respond dynamically based on predicted intent and patient input. This orchestrated response could not only reduce fall risk but also attend to the patient's underlying motivations for movement, such as thirst, discomfort, or the need for assistance, before a hazardous situation arises. Our contributions with this pilot study are three-fold: (1) a modular IoRT-based framework enabling distributed sensing, prediction, and multi-robot coordination; (2) a demonstration of low-resolution thermal sensing for accurate, privacy-preserving preemptive bed-exit detection; and (3) results from a user study and systematic error analysis that inform the design of situationally aware, multi-agent interactions in hospital settings. The findings highlight how interactive and connected robotic systems can move beyond passive monitoring to deliver timely, meaningful assistance, empowering safer, more responsive care environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICSR ...</summary><p>ICSR 2025, 8 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

Based on the principle of implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target morphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or game-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the same. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time production of various morphological forms (e.g., "Daddy wears these when he drives to work"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent also must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based activity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an application in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval game "Alias" with children to improve language skills. Our application currently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue, affective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the capacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological targets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at this task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately serve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using LLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for children with language vulnerabilities. Our long-term goal is to create a robust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of teaching a variety of morphological structures across different languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, Preprint of: Sundstedt, S., Wingren, M., H\"agglund, S. & Ventus, D.

Given the rapid development of artificial intelligence, robot capabilities and their potential to function as colleagues and companions are growing. This systematic literature review synthesises 22 empirical studies selected from an initial pool of 728 articles published between 2011 and 2024. Articles were retrieved from major scientific databases and identified based on empirical focus and conceptual relevance, namely, how to preserve and promote human autonomy and sense of agency in HRI. Derived through thematic synthesis, five clusters of potentially influential factors are revealed: robot adaptiveness, communication style, anthropomorphism, presence of a robot and individual differences. Measured through psychometric scales or the intentional binding paradigm, perceptions of autonomy and agency varied across industrial, educational, healthcare, care, and hospitality settings. The review underscores the theoretical differences between both concepts, but their yet entangled use in HRI. Despite increasing interest, the current body of empirical evidence remains limited and fragmented, underscoring the necessity for standardised definitions, more robust operationalisations, and further exploratory and qualitative research. By identifying existing gaps and highlighting emerging trends, this review contributes to the development of human-centered, autonomy-supportive robot design strategies that uphold ethical and psychological principles, ultimately supporting well-being in human-robot interaction.</p></details> |  |

Empirically Investigating Values That Should Be Embedded in SARs from a Multi-Stakeholder Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22146v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of socially assistive robots (SARs) in elder care settings has the potential to address critical labor shortages while enhancing the quality of care. However, the design of SARs must align with the values of various stakeholders to ensure their acceptance and efficacy. This study empirically investigates the values that should be embedded in SARs from a multi-stakeholder perspective, including care receivers, caregivers, therapists, relatives, and other involved parties. Utilizing a combination of semi-structured interviews and focus groups, we identify a wide range of values related to safety, trust, care, privacy, and autonomy, and illustrate how stakeholders interpret these values in real-world care environments. Our findings reveal several value tensions and propose potential resolutions to these tensions. Additionally, the study highlights under-researched values such as calmness and collaboration, which are critical in fostering a supportive and efficient care environment. Our work contributes to the understanding of value-sensitive design of SARs and aids practitioners in developing SARs that align with human values, ultimately promoting socially responsible applications in elder care settings.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness depends heavily on the design of control systems. Designing robust controllers is challenging because of uncertainties in human-robot systems. Among various control strategies, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful approach due to its ability to handle constraints and optimize performance. Previous studies have used linearization-based methods to implement robust MPC on exoskeletons, but these can degrade performance due to nonlinearities in the robot's dynamics. To address this gap, this paper proposes a Robust Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (RNMPC) method, called multi-stage NMPC, to control a two-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton by solving a nonlinear optimization problem. This method uses multiple scenarios to represent system uncertainties. The study focuses on minimizing human-robot interaction forces during the swing phase, particularly when the robot carries unknown loads. Simulations and experimental tests show that the proposed method significantly improves robustness, outperforming non-robust NMPC. It achieves lower tracking errors and interaction forces under various uncertainties. For instance, when a 2 kg unknown payload is combined with external disturbances, the RMS values of thigh and shank interaction forces for multi-stage NMPC are reduced by 77 and 94 percent, respectively, compared to non-robust NMPC.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables, under review at the journal of "Transactions of the Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering"</p></details> |

To inform and enhance operations for these roving laboratories, it is imperative to understand the terramechanical properties of their environments, especially for traversing on loose, deformable substrates. Recent research suggested that legged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively detect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain properties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling speed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This paper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on proprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a sensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait, Trot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of deformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory transect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with synthetic surface crusts. Our results suggest that with both the sensing-oriented crawling gait and locomotion-oriented trot gait, the robot can measure a consistent difference in the strength (in terms of penetration resistance) between the low- and high-resistance substrates; however, the locomotion-oriented trot gait contains larger magnitude and variance in measurements. Furthermore, the slower crawl gait can detect brittle ruptures of the surface crusts with significantly higher accuracy than the faster trot gait. Our results offer new insights that inform legged robot "sensing during locomotion" gait design and planning for scouting the terrain and producing scientific measurements on other worlds to advance our understanding of their geology and formation.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+1 p...</summary><p>7+1 pages, 5 figures, ICRA Submission This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general-purpose capabilities but remain limited in temporal reasoning, uncertainty estimation, and structured outputs needed for robotic planning.

The framework generates structured scene graphs and leverages a hybrid retrieval module for interpretable and adaptive reasoning. Evaluations on the Video-MME benchmark and a custom clinical dataset show competitive accuracy and improved robustness compared to state-of-the-art VLMs, demonstrating its potential for applications in robot-assisted surgery, patient monitoring, and decision support.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

We present AVR (Active Vision-driven Robotics), a bimanual teleoperation and learning framework that unifies head-tracked viewpoint control (HMD-to-2-DoF gimbal) with motorized optical zoom to keep targets centered at an appropriate scale during data collection and deployment. In simulation, an AVR plugin augments RoboTwin demonstrations by emulating active vision (ROI-conditioned viewpoint change, aspect-ratio-preserving crops with explicit zoom ratios, and super-resolution), yielding 5-17% gains in task success across diverse manipulations. On our real-world platform, AVR improves success on most tasks, with over 25% gains compared to the static-view baseline, and extended studies further demonstrate robustness under occlusion, clutter, and lighting disturbances, as well as generalization to unseen environments and objects. These results pave the way for future robotic precision manipulation methods in the pursuit of human-level dexterity and precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://AVR-robot.github.io</p></details> |
| **[One-DoF Robotic Design of Overconstrained Limbs with Energy-Efficient, Self-Collision-Free Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22002v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While it is expected to build robotic limbs with multiple degrees of freedom (DoF) inspired by nature, a single DoF design remains fundamental, providing benefits that include, but are not limited to, simplicity, robustness, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency. Mechanisms, especially those with multiple links and revolute joints connected in closed loops, play an enabling factor in introducing motion diversity for 1-DoF systems, which are usually constrained by self-collision during a full-cycle range of motion. This study presents a novel computational approach to designing one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF) overconstrained robotic limbs for a desired spatial trajectory, while achieving energy-efficient, self-collision-free motion in full-cycle rotations. Firstly, we present the geometric optimization problem of linkage-based robotic limbs in a generalized formulation for self-collision-free design. Next, we formulate the spatial trajectory generation problem with the overconstrained linkages by optimizing the similarity and dynamic-related metrics. We further optimize the geometric shape of the overconstrained linkage to ensure smooth and collision-free motion driven by a single actuator. We validated our proposed method through various experiments, including personalized automata and bio-inspired hexapod robots. The resulting hexapod robot, featuring overconstrained robotic limbs, demonstrated outstanding energy efficiency during forward walking.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Learnable Conformal Prediction with Context-Aware Nonconformity Functions for Robotic Planning and Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21955v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models in robotics often output point estimates with poorly calibrated confidences, offering no native mechanism to quantify predictive reliability under novel, noisy, or out-of-distribution inputs. Conformal prediction (CP) addresses this gap by providing distribution-free coverage guarantees, yet its reliance on fixed nonconformity scores ignores context and can yield intervals that are overly conservative or unsafe. We address this with Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP), which replaces fixed scores with a lightweight neural function that leverages geometric, semantic, and task-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets. LCP maintains CP's theoretical guarantees while reducing prediction set sizes by 18% in classification, tightening detection intervals by 52%, and improving path planning safety from 72% to 91% success with minimal overhead. Across three robotic tasks on seven benchmarks, LCP consistently outperforms Standard CP and ensemble baselines. In classification on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, it achieves smaller set sizes (4.7-9.9% reduction) at target coverage. For object detection on COCO, BDD100K, and Cityscapes, it produces 46-54% tighter bounding boxes. In path planning through cluttered environments, it improves success to 91.5% with only 4.5% path inflation, compared to 12.2% for Standard CP. The method is lightweight (approximately 4.8% runtime overhead, 42 KB memory) and supports online adaptation, making it well suited to resource-constrained autonomous systems. Hardware evaluation shows LCP adds less than 1% memory and 15.9% inference overhead, yet sustains 39 FPS on detection tasks while being 7.4 times more energy-efficient than ensembles.</p></details> |  |

However, extending MBRL to multi-robot cooperation remains challenging due to the complexity of joint dynamics and the reliance on synchronous communication. SeqWM employs independent, autoregressive agent-wise world models to represent joint dynamics, where each agent generates its future trajectory and plans its actions based on the predictions of its predecessors. This design lowers modeling complexity, alleviates the reliance on communication synchronization, and enables the emergence of advanced cooperative behaviors through explicit intention sharing. Experiments in challenging simulated environments (Bi-DexHands and Multi-Quad) demonstrate that SeqWM outperforms existing state-of-the-art model-based and model-free baselines in both overall performance and sample efficiency, while exhibiting advanced cooperative behaviors such as predictive adaptation, temporal alignment, and role division. Furthermore, SeqWM has been success fully deployed on physical quadruped robots, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems.

Inspired by the Turkish Ice Cream (TIC) vendor routine, we investigate how bounded, culturally familiar forms of deception influence user trust, enjoyment, and engagement during robotic handovers. We design a robotic manipulator equipped with a custom end-effector and implement five TIC-inspired trick policies that deceptively delay the handover of an ice cream-shaped object. Through a mixed-design user study with 91 participants, we evaluate the effects of playful deception and interaction duration on user experience. Results reveal that TIC-inspired deception significantly enhances enjoyment and engagement, though reduces perceived safety and trust, suggesting a structured trade-off across the multi-dimensional aspects. Our findings demonstrate that playful deception can be a valuable design strategy for interactive robots in entertainment and engagement-focused contexts, while underscoring the importance of deliberate consideration of its complex trade-offs.

We leverage origami surface capabilities to achieve shape contraction and to support locomotion with underactuated forms. A key challenge is that origami surfaces have high degrees of freedom and typically require many actuators; we address repeatability by integrating surface compliance. We propose a mono-actuated GeoGami mobile platform that combines origami surface compliance with a geometric compliant skeleton, enabling the robot to transform and locomote using a single actuator. We demonstrate the robot, develop a stiffness model, and describe the central gearbox mechanism. We also analyze alternative cable-driven actuation methods for the skeleton to enable surface transformation. Finally, we evaluate the GeoGami platform for capabilities, including shape transformation and rolling. This platform opens new capabilities for robots that change shape to access different environments and that use shape transformation for locomotion.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 12 figures, under-review</p></details> |

However, robotic wrists are equally critical, often playing a greater role than the end effector itself. Many conventional wrist designs fall short in human environments because they are too large or rely on rigid, high-reduction actuators that cannot support dynamic, contact-rich tasks. Some designs address these issues using backdrivable quasi-direct drive (QDD) actuators and compact form factors. However, they are often difficult to model and control due to coupled kinematics or high mechanical inertia. We present DexWrist, a robotic wrist that is designed to advance robotic manipulation in highly constrained environments, enable dynamic and contact-rich tasks, and simplify policy learning. DexWrist provides low-impedance actuation, low inertia, integrated proprioception, high speed, and a large workspace. Together, these capabilities support robust learning-based manipulation. DexWrist accelerates policy learning by: (i) enabling faster teleoperation for scalable data collection, (ii) simplifying the learned function through shorter trajectories and decoupled degrees of freedom (DOFs), (iii) providing natural backdrivability for safe contact without complex compliant controllers, and (iv) expanding the manipulation workspace in cluttered scenes. In our experiments, DexWrist improved policy success rates by 50-55% and reduced task completion times by a factor of 3-5. More details about the wrist can be found at https://dexwrist.csail.mit.edu.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures. Submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Modal Instructions for Robot Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21107v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot. While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm, Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contact-Aware Safety in Soft Robots Using High-Order Control Barrier and Lyapunov Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03841v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots operating alongside people, particularly in sensitive scenarios such as aiding the elderly with daily tasks or collaborating with workers in manufacturing, must guarantee safety and cultivate user trust. Continuum soft manipulators promise safety through material compliance, but as designs evolve for greater precision, payload capacity, and speed, and increasingly incorporate rigid elements, their injury risk resurfaces. In this letter, we introduce a comprehensive High-Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) + High-Order Control Lyapunov Function (HOCLF) framework that enforces strict contact force limits across the entire soft-robot body during environmental interactions. Our approach combines a differentiable Piecewise Cosserat-Segment (PCS) dynamics model with a convex-polygon distance approximation metric, named Differentiable Conservative Separating Axis Theorem (DCSAT), based on the soft robot geometry to enable real-time, whole-body collision detection, resolution, and enforcement of the safety constraints. By embedding HOCBFs into our optimization routine, we guarantee safety, allowing, for instance, safe navigation in operational space under HOCLF-driven motion objectives. Extensive planar simulations demonstrate that our method maintains safety-bounded contacts while achieving precise shape and task-space regulation. This work thus lays a foundation for the deployment of soft robots in human-centric environments with provable safety and performance.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Multi-Robot Vision-Based Task and Motion Planning for EV Battery Disassembly and Sorting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21020v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electric-vehicle (EV) battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot coordination, short and reliable motions, and robust collision safety in cluttered, dynamic scenes. We propose a four-layer task-and-motion planning (TAMP) framework that couples symbolic task planning and cost- and accessibility-aware allocation with a TP-GMM-guided motion planner learned from demonstrations. Stereo vision with YOLOv8 provides real-time component localization, while OctoMap-based 3D mapping and FCL(Flexible Collision Library) checks in MoveIt unify predictive digital-twin collision checking with reactive, vision-based avoidance. Validated on two UR10e robots across cable, busbar, service plug, and three leaf-cell removals, the approach yields substantially more compact and safer motions than a default RRTConnect baseline under identical perception and task assignments: average end-effector path length drops by $-63.3\%$ and makespan by $-8.1\%$; per-arm swept volumes shrink (R1: $0.583\rightarrow0.139\,\mathrm{m}^3$; R2: $0.696\rightarrow0.252\,\mathrm{m}^3$), and mutual overlap decreases by $47\%$ ($0.064\rightarrow0.034\,\mathrm{m}^3$). These results highlight improved autonomy, precision, and safety for multi-robot EV battery disassembly in unstructured, dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

| **[ImaginationPolicy: Towards Generalizable, Precise and Reliable End-to-End Policy for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20841v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks, multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contribute equally.

While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model (LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios. Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

| **[Occlusion-Aware Consistent Model Predictive Control for Robot Navigation in Occluded Obstacle-Dense Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04563v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety and motion consistency for robot navigation in occluded, obstacle-dense environments is a critical challenge. In this context, this study presents an occlusion-aware Consistent Model Predictive Control (CMPC) strategy. To account for the occluded obstacles, it incorporates adjustable risk regions that represent their potential future locations. Subsequently, dynamic risk boundary constraints are developed online to ensure safety.The CMPC then constructs multiple locally optimal trajectory branches (each tailored to different risk regions) to strike a balance between safety and performance. A shared consensus segment is generated to ensure smooth transitions between branches without significant velocity fluctuations, further preserving motion consistency. To facilitate high computational efficiency and ensure coordination across local trajectories, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the CMPC into manageable sub-problems for parallel solving. The proposed strategy is validated through simulations and real-world experiments on an Ackermann-steering robot platform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CMPC strategy through comparisons with baseline approaches in occluded, obstacle-dense environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Digital Twin-Guided Robot Path Planning: A Beta-Bernoulli Fusion with Large Language Model as a Sensor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20709v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating natural language (NL) prompts into robotic mission planning has attracted significant interest in recent years. In the construction domain, Building Information Models (BIM) encapsulate rich NL descriptions of the environment. We present a novel framework that fuses NL directives with BIM-derived semantic maps via a Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion by interpreting the LLM as a sensor: each obstacle's design-time repulsive coefficient is treated as a Beta(alpha, beta) random variable and LLM-returned danger scores are incorporated as pseudo-counts to update alpha and beta. The resulting posterior mean yields a continuous, context-aware repulsive gain that augments a Euclidean-distance-based potential field for cost heuristics. By adjusting gains based on sentiment and context inferred from user prompts, our method guides robots along safer, more context-aware paths. This provides a numerically stable method that can chain multiple natural commands and prompts from construction workers and foreman to enable planning while giving flexibility to be integrated in any learned or classical AI framework. Simulation results demonstrate that this Beta-Bernoulli fusion yields both qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site Digital Twins (BIM2RDT): An Agentic AI Safety-First Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20705v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods, SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP, achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization For Feasible Robot Motion Generation from Video Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20703v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints. We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization (JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics. To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to $\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional approaches are insufficient in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors. These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family, RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Joint...</summary><p>Joint first authors: Shouren Mao and Minghao Qin.

However, existing BCI-Robot systems face major limitations: electroencephalography (EEG) signals are noisy and unstable, target selection is often predefined and inflexible, and most studies remain restricted to simulation without closed-loop validation. These issues hinder real-world deployment in assistive scenarios. To address them, we propose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery (MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic grasping for zero-touch operation. A 14-channel EEG headset enabled individualized MI calibration, a smartphone-based AR interface supported multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback to enhance stability, and the robotic arm combined decision outputs with vision-based pose estimation for autonomous grasping. Experiments are conducted to validate the framework: MI training achieved 93.1 percent accuracy with an average information transfer rate (ITR) of 14.8 bit/min; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained control (SCI = 0.210) and achieved the highest ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared with static, sham, and no-AR baselines; and closed-loop grasping achieved a 97.2 percent success rate with good efficiency and strong user-reported control. These results show that AR feedback substantially stabilizes EEG-based control and that the proposed framework enables robust zero-touch grasping, advancing assistive robotic applications and future modes of human-robot interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 14 figures, submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |
