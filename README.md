| **[SpatialCoT: Advancing Spatial Reasoning through Coordinate Alignment and Chain-of-Thought for Embodied Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10074v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning is an essential problem in embodied AI research. Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[EmbodiedEval: Evaluate Multimodal LLMs as Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11858v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant advancements, providing a promising future for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenEx: Generating an Explorable World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09624v4)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding, navigating, and exploring the 3D physical real world has long been a central challenge in the development of artificial intelligence. In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</p></details> | Website: GenEx.world |
| **[Embodied Agent Interface: Benchmarking LLMs for Embodied Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07166v3)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for embodied decision making. While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

| **[Embodied Scene Understanding for Vision Language Models via MetaVQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09167v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate significant potential as embodied AI agents for various mobility applications. However, a standardized, closed-loop benchmark for evaluating their spatial reasoning and sequential decision-making capabilities is lacking. To address this, we present MetaVQA: a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess and enhance VLMs' understanding of spatial relationships and scene dynamics through Visual Question Answering (VQA) and closed-loop simulations. MetaVQA leverages Set-of-Mark prompting and top-down view ground-truth annotations from nuScenes and Waymo datasets to automatically generate extensive question-answer pairs based on diverse real-world traffic scenarios, ensuring object-centric and context-rich instructions. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with the MetaVQA dataset significantly improves their spatial reasoning and embodied scene comprehension in safety-critical simulations, evident not only in improved VQA accuracies but also in emerging safety-aware driving maneuvers. In addition, the learning demonstrates strong transferability from simulation to real-world observation. Code and data will be publicly available at https://metadriverse.github.io/metavqa .</p></details> | <details><summary>for t...</summary><p>for the project webpage, see https://metadriverse.github.io/metavqa</p></details> |
| **[Physical AI Agents: Integrating Cognitive Intelligence with Real-World Action](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08944v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vertical AI Agents are revolutionizing industries by delivering domain-specific intelligence and tailored solutions. However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks. This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context. Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Mind the Error! Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

| **[Perception Matters: Enhancing Embodied AI with Uncertainty-Aware Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02297v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI has made significant progress acting in unexplored environments. However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Embodied AI in Healthcare: Techniques, Applications, and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07468v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare systems worldwide face persistent challenges in efficiency, accessibility, and personalization. Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | 44 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Semantic Mapping in Indoor Embodied AI -- A Comprehensive Survey and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05750v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent embodied agents (e.g. robots) need to perform complex semantic tasks in unfamiliar environments. Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied VideoAgent: Persistent Memory from Egocentric Videos and Embodied Sensors Enables Dynamic Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00358v2)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the problem of understanding dynamic 3D scenes from egocentric observations, a key challenge in robotics and embodied AI. Unlike prior studies that explored this as long-form video understanding and utilized egocentric video only, we instead propose an LLM-based agent, Embodied VideoAgent, which constructs scene memory from both egocentric video and embodied sensory inputs (e.g. depth and pose sensing). We further introduce a VLM-based approach to automatically update the memory when actions or activities over objects are perceived. Embodied VideoAgent attains significant advantages over counterparts in challenging reasoning and planning tasks in 3D scenes, achieving gains of 4.9% on Ego4D-VQ3D, 5.8% on OpenEQA, and 11.7% on EnvQA. We have also demonstrated its potential in various embodied AI tasks including generating embodied interactions and perception for robot manipulation. The code and demo will be made public.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://embodied-videoagent.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[PlanLLM: Video Procedure Planning with Refinable Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19139v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video procedure planning, i.e., planning a sequence of action steps given the video frames of start and goal states, is an essential ability for embodied AI. Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |
| **[ViGiL3D: A Linguistically Diverse Dataset for 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01366v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D visual grounding (3DVG) involves localizing entities in a 3D scene referred to by natural language text. Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Embodied AI-Enhanced Vehicular Networks: An Integrated Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01141v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates adaptive transmission strategies in embodied AI-enhanced vehicular networks by integrating large language models (LLMs) for semantic information extraction and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for decision-making. The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Embodied Image Quality Assessment for Robotic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18774v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) of user-generated content (UGC) is a critical technique for human quality of experience (QoE). However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

Additionally, we offer a variety of playable entities for embodied AI agents. Based on UnrealCV, we provide a suite of easy-to-use Python APIs and tools for various potential applications, such as data collection, environment augmentation, distributed training, and benchmarking. We optimize the rendering and communication efficiency of UnrealCV to support advanced applications, such as multi-agent interaction. Our experiments benchmark agents in various complex scenes, focusing on visual navigation and tracking, which are fundamental capabilities for embodied visual intelligence. The results yield valuable insights into the advantages of diverse training environments for reinforcement learning (RL) agents and the challenges faced by current embodied vision agents, including those based on RL and large vision-language models (VLMs), in open worlds. These challenges involve latency in closed-loop control in dynamic scenes and reasoning about 3D spatial structures in unstructured terrain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: http://unrealzoo.site/</p></details> |

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV. Finally, we discuss several future research directions for advancing EAI-enabled LAE.</p></details> |  |
| **[MrSteve: Instruction-Following Agents in Minecraft with What-Where-When Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06736v4)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant advances have been made in developing general-purpose embodied AI in environments like Minecraft through the adoption of LLM-augmented hierarchical approaches. While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</p></details> |  |

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/</p></details> |

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[POEX: Policy Executable Embodied AI Jailbreak Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16633v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into the planning module of Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) systems has greatly enhanced their ability to translate complex user instructions into executable policies. In this paper, we demystified how traditional LLM jailbreak attacks behave in the Embodied AI context. We conducted a comprehensive safety analysis of the LLM-based planning module of embodied AI systems against jailbreak attacks. Using the carefully crafted Harmful-RLbench, we accessed 20 open-source and proprietary LLMs under traditional jailbreak attacks, and highlighted two key challenges when adopting the prior jailbreak techniques to embodied AI contexts: (1) The harmful text output by LLMs does not necessarily induce harmful policies in Embodied AI context, and (2) even we can generate harmful policies, we have to guarantee they are executable in practice. To overcome those challenges, we propose Policy Executable (POEX) jailbreak attacks, where harmful instructions and optimized suffixes are injected into LLM-based planning modules, leading embodied AI to perform harmful actions in both simulated and physical environments. Our approach involves constraining adversarial suffixes to evade detection and fine-tuning a policy evaluater to improve the executability of harmful policies. We conducted extensive experiments on both a robotic arm embodied AI platform and simulators, to validate the attack and policy success rates on 136 harmful instructions from Harmful-RLbench. Our findings expose serious safety vulnerabilities in LLM-based planning modules, including the ability of POEX to be transferred across models. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies, such as safety-constrained prompts, pre- and post-planning checks, to address these vulnerabilities and ensure the safe deployment of embodied AI in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of previous magical grasp implementations at similar GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |
| **[ON as ALC: Active Loop Closing Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11523v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In simultaneous localization and mapping, active loop closing (ALC) is an active vision problem that aims to visually guide a robot to maximize the chances of revisiting previously visited points, thereby resetting the drift errors accumulated in the incrementally built map during travel. However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task of embodied AI that requires the agent to find a target object in unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging as it demands both perceptual and cognitive processes for effective perception and decision-making. While perception has gained significant progress powered by the rapidly developed visual foundation models, the progress on the cognitive side remains limited to either implicitly learning from massive navigation demonstrations or explicitly leveraging pre-defined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that humans consistently update their cognitive states while searching for objects in unseen environments, we present CogNav, which attempts to model this cognitive process with the help of large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process with a finite state machine composed of cognitive states ranging from exploration to identification. The transitions between the states are determined by a large language model based on an online built heterogeneous cognitive map containing spatial and semantic information of the scene being explored. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world environments demonstrate that our cognitive modeling significantly improves ObjectNav efficiency, with human-like navigation behaviors. In an open-vocabulary and zero-shot setting, our method advances the SOTA of the HM3D benchmark from 69.3% to 87.2%. The code and data will be released.</p></details> |  |

The central case study is Jess+ an intelligent digital score system for shared creativity with a mixed ensemble of non-disabled and disabled musicians. The overarching aim is that the digital score enables disabled musicians to thrive in a live music conversation with other musicians regardless of the potential barriers of disability and music-making. After defining what we mean by embodied AI and how this approach supports the aims of the Jess+ project, we outline the main design features of the system. This includes several novel approaches such as its modular design, an AI Factory based on an embodied musicking dataset, and an embedded belief system. Our findings showed that the implemented design decisions and embodied-AI approach led to rich experiences for the musicians which in turn transformed their practice as an inclusive ensemble.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models in Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07904v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated a wide range of capabilities across many domains, including Embodied AI. In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This study finds that state-of-the-art embodied AI agents compete for higher navigation quality, but often compromise the computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce "Skip-SCAR," an optimization framework that builds computationally and memory-efficient embodied AI agents to accomplish high-quality visual navigation tasks. Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint. Tested on the HM3D ObjectNav datasets and real-world physical hardware systems, Skip-SCAR not only minimizes hardware resources but also sets new performance benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of optimizing both navigation quality and computational efficiency for robotics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Privacy Risks in Reinforcement Learning for Household Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09273v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prominence of embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI), which empowers robots to navigate, perceive, and engage within virtual environments, has attracted significant attention, owing to the remarkable advances in computer vision and large language models. Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |

Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

Despite recent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods often lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in scenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this paper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and scalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors and multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion (OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved surfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric fidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital twins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM-based planners are inefficient due to their large number of parameters and prone to inaccuracies because they operate in open-loop systems. We think the reason is that only applying LLMs as planners is insufficient. In this work, we propose DaDu-E, a robust closed-loop planning framework for embodied AI robots. Specifically, DaDu-E is equipped with a relatively lightweight LLM, a set of encapsulated robot skill instructions, a robust feedback system, and memory augmentation. Together, these components enable DaDu-E to (i) actively perceive and adapt to dynamic environments, (ii) optimize computational costs while maintaining high performance, and (iii) recover from execution failures using its memory and feedback mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world and simulated tasks show that DaDu-E achieves task success rates comparable to embodied AI robots with larger models as planners like COME-Robot, while reducing computational requirements by $6.6 \times$.

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters, connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and easy integration with downstream tasks.

| **[LSceneLLM: Enhancing Large 3D Scene Understanding Using Adaptive Visual Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01292v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on 3D Vision-Language Models (3D-VLMs) is gaining increasing attention, which is crucial for developing embodied AI within 3D scenes, such as visual navigation and embodied question answering. Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |

Generalizing ObjectNav to Dynamic Environments with Portable Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09905v2)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ObjectNav is a popular task in Embodied AI, where an agent navigates to a target object in an unseen environment. Prior literature makes the assumption of a static environment with stationary objects, which lacks realism. To address this, we present a novel formulation to generalize ObjectNav to dynamic environments with non-stationary objects, and refer to it as Portable ObjectNav or P-ObjectNav. In our formulation, we first address several challenging issues with dynamizing existing topological scene graphs by developing a novel method that introduces multiple transition behaviors to portable objects in the scene. We use this technique to dynamize Matterport3D, a popular simulator for evaluating embodied tasks. We then present a benchmark for P-ObjectNav using a combination of heuristic, reinforcement learning, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based navigation approaches on the dynamized environment, while introducing novel evaluation metrics tailored for our task. Our work fundamentally challenges the "static-environment" notion of prior ObjectNav work; the code and dataset for P-ObjectNav will be made publicly available to foster research on embodied navigation in dynamic scenes. We provide an anonymized repository for our code and dataset: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PObjectNav-1C6D.</p></details> | 19 |

However, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning task. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant under-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward model and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment performance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated Human Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and demonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach admits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and leverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy Optimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment pipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with extensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially when the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[EARBench: Towards Evaluating Physical Risk Awareness for Task Planning of Foundation Model-based Embodied AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04449v5)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) integrates advanced AI models into physical entities for real-world interaction. The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EARBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EARDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

The rise of instruction-following robotic policies in embodied AI has spurred the development of a novel category of multi-modal models known as vision-language-action models (VLAs). Their multi-modality capability has become a foundational element in robot learning. Various methods have been proposed to enhance traits such as versatility, dexterity, and generalizability. Some models focus on refining specific components. Others aim to develop control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. Certain VLAs serve as high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into executable subtasks. Over the past few years, a myriad of VLAs have emerged, reflecting the rapid advancement of embodied AI. Therefore, it is imperative to capture the evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, a survey of vision-language-action models</p></details> |

However, when powered with open large language models (LLMs), these agents often struggle with rudimentary tasks, even when fine-tuned on domain-specific knowledge. Inspired by human cultural learning, we present \collabvoyager, a novel framework that enhances Voyager with lifelong collaborative learning through explicit perspective-taking. \collabvoyager introduces three key innovations: (1) theory of mind representations linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural language communication between agents; and (3) semantic memory of task and environment knowledge and episodic memory of collaboration episodes. These advancements enable agents to reason about their and others' mental states, empirically addressing two prevalent failure modes: false beliefs and faulty task executions. In mixed-expertise Minecraft experiments, \collabvoyager agents outperform Voyager counterparts, significantly improving task completion rate by $66.6\% (+39.4\%)$ for collecting one block of dirt and $70.8\% (+20.8\%)$ for collecting one wood block. They exhibit emergent behaviors like knowledge transfer from expert to novice agents and collaborative code correction. \collabvoyager agents also demonstrate the ability to adapt to out-of-distribution tasks by using their previous experiences and beliefs obtained through collaboration. In this open-ended social learning paradigm, \collabvoyager paves the way for the democratic development of embodied AI, where agents learn in deployment from both peer and environmental feedback.</p></details> |  |

However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downstream tasks. Image-to-video diffusion models are already capable of generating highly realistic synthetic videos. However, these models are not action-conditioned, and the most powerful models are closed-source which means they cannot be finetuned. In this work, we propose to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to action-conditioned world models, without access to the parameters of the pretrained model. Our approach, AVID, trains an adapter on a small domain-specific dataset of action-labelled videos. AVID uses a learned mask to modify the intermediate outputs of the pretrained model and generate accurate action-conditioned videos. We evaluate AVID on video game and real-world robotics data, and show that it outperforms existing baselines for diffusion model adaptation.1 Our results demonstrate that if utilized correctly, pretrained video models have the potential to be powerful tools for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/avid-world-model-adapters/home</p></details> |

In this study, we introduce ROOT, a VLM-based system designed to enhance the analysis of indoor scenes. Specifically, we first develop an iterative object perception algorithm using GPT-4V to detect object entities within indoor scenes. This is followed by employing vision foundation models to acquire additional meta-information about the scene, such as bounding boxes. Building on this foundational data, we propose a specialized VLM, SceneVLM, which is capable of generating spatial hierarchical scene graphs and providing distance information for objects within indoor environments. This information enhances our understanding of the spatial arrangement of indoor scenes. To train our SceneVLM, we collect over 610,000 images from various public indoor datasets and implement a scene data generation pipeline with a semi-automated technique to establish relationships and estimate distances among indoor objects. By utilizing this enriched data, we conduct various training recipes and finish SceneVLM. Our experiments demonstrate that \rootname facilitates indoor scene understanding and proves effective in diverse downstream applications, such as 3D scene generation and embodied AI. The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/harrytea/ROOT}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs and 3D segmentation masks. In addition, we design MORE3D, a simple yet effective method that enables multi-object 3D reasoning segmentation with user questions and textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative World Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

| **[Software-Hardware Co-Design For Embodied AI Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04292v4)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI robots have the potential to fundamentally improve the way human beings live and manufacture. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame-basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes Corki, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI robot control. Our idea is to decouple LLM inference, robotic control and data communication in the embodied AI robots compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, Corki predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. Corki largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to 8.0x, resulting in up to 3.6x speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 17.3%. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/hyy0613/Corki</p></details> |  |

Generated models frequently fail to maintain balance when placed in physics-based simulations or 3D printed. This balance is crucial for satisfying user design intentions in interactive gaming, embodied AI, and robotics, where stable models are needed for reliable interaction. Additionally, stable models ensure that 3D-printed objects, such as figurines for home decoration, can stand on their own without requiring additional supports. To fill this gap, we introduce Atlas3D, an automatic and easy-to-implement method that enhances existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D tools. Atlas3D ensures the generation of self-supporting 3D models that adhere to physical laws of stability under gravity, contact, and friction. Our approach combines a novel differentiable simulation-based loss function with physically inspired regularization, serving as either a refinement or a post-processing module for existing frameworks. We verify Atlas3D's efficacy through extensive generation tasks and validate the resulting 3D models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunuoch.github.io/Atlas3D/</p></details> |

Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing Architect, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene. This iterative structure brings the flexibility for our method to generate or refine scenes from various starting points, such as text, floor plans, or pre-arranged environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Models in Vision: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05902v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive modeling has been a huge success in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, \textit{i.e.}, pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the strategy of representation. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multi-faceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multi-modal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: \url{https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey}.</p></details> |  |
| **["Where am I?" Scene Retrieval with Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14565v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interfaces to embodied AI are becoming more ubiquitous in our daily lives. This opens up further opportunities for language-based interaction with embodied agents, such as a user verbally instructing an agent to execute some task in a specific location. For example, "put the bowls back in the cupboard next to the fridge" or "meet me at the intersection under the red sign." As such, we need methods that interface between natural language and map representations of the environment. To this end, we explore the question of whether we can use an open-set natural language query to identify a scene represented by a 3D scene graph. We define this task as "language-based scene-retrieval" and it is closely related to "coarse-localization," but we are instead searching for a match from a collection of disjoint scenes and not necessarily a large-scale continuous map. We present Text2SceneGraphMatcher, a "scene-retrieval" pipeline that learns joint embeddings between text descriptions and scene graphs to determine if they are a match. The code, trained models, and datasets will be made public.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

However, current VLN frameworks often rely on static environments and optimal expert supervision, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation (HA-VLN), extending traditional VLN by incorporating dynamic human activities and relaxing key assumptions. We propose the Human-Aware 3D (HA3D) simulator, which combines dynamic human activities with the Matterport3D dataset, and the Human-Aware Room-to-Room (HA-R2R) dataset, extending R2R with human activity descriptions. To tackle HA-VLN challenges, we present the Expert-Supervised Cross-Modal (VLN-CM) and Non-Expert-Supervised Decision Transformer (VLN-DT) agents, utilizing cross-modal fusion and diverse training strategies for effective navigation in dynamic human environments. A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability.

Our system is modular: it deploys state of the art Large Language Models for task planning,Vision-Language models for semantic perception, and Point Cloud transformers for grasping. With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities. One may also in-place swap modules to improve the robustness of the overall platform, for instance with imitation-learned policies.

At present, many evaluation platforms with rich scenes, high visual fidelity and various application scenarios have been developed. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework named NeuronsGym that can be used for policy learning of robot tasks, covering a simulation platform for training policy, and a physical system for studying sim2real problems. Unlike most current single-task, slow-moving robotic platforms, our framework provides agile physical robots with a wider range of speeds, and can be employed to train robotic navigation and confrontation policies. At the same time, in order to evaluate the safety of robot navigation, we propose a safety-weighted path length (SFPL) to improve the safety evaluation in the current mobile robot navigation. Based on this platform, we build a new benchmark for navigation and confrontation tasks under this platform by comparing the current mainstream sim2real methods, and hold the 2022 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) RoboMaster sim2real challenge. We release the codes of this framework\footnote{\url{https://github.com/DRL-CASIA/NeuronsGym}} and hope that this platform can promote the development of more flexible and agile general mobile agent algorithms.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

One notably promising application of LLM agents is robotic manipulation. Recent research has shown that LLMs can generate text planning or control code for robots, providing substantial flexibility and interaction capabilities. However, these methods still face challenges in terms of flexibility and applicability across different environments, limiting their ability to adapt autonomously. Current approaches typically fall into two categories: those relying on environment-specific policy training, which restricts their transferability, and those generating code actions based on fixed prompts, which leads to diminished performance when confronted with new environments. These limitations significantly constrain the generalizability of agents in robotic manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called EnvBridge. This approach involves the retention and transfer of successful robot control codes from source environments to target environments. EnvBridge enhances the agent's adaptability and performance across diverse settings by leveraging insights from multiple environments. Notably, our approach alleviates environmental constraints, offering a more flexible and generalizable solution for robotic manipulation tasks. We validated the effectiveness of our method using robotic manipulation benchmarks: RLBench, MetaWorld, and CALVIN. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully leverage diverse knowledge sources to solve complex tasks. Consequently, our approach significantly enhances the adaptability and robustness of robotic manipulation agents in planning across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

When integrated into an embodied agent, existing embodied VLM works either output detailed action sequences at the manipulation level or only provide plans at an abstract level, leaving a gap between high-level planning and real-world manipulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octopus, an embodied vision-language programmer that uses executable code generation as a medium to connect planning and manipulation. Octopus is designed to 1) proficiently comprehend an agent's visual and textual task objectives, 2) formulate intricate action sequences, and 3) generate executable code. To facilitate Octopus model development, we introduce OctoVerse: a suite of environments tailored for benchmarking vision-based code generators on a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games such as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Minecraft. To train Octopus, we leverage GPT-4 to control an explorative agent that generates training data, i.e., action blueprints and corresponding executable code. We also collect feedback that enables an enhanced training scheme called Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate Octopus's functionality and present compelling results, showing that the proposed RLEF refines the agent's decision-making. By open-sourcing our simulation environments, dataset, and model architecture, we aspire to ignite further innovation and foster collaborative applications within the broader embodied AI community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://choiszt.github.io/Octopus/, Codebase: https://github.com/dongyh20/Octopus</p></details> |

More recently, multi-agent systems with LLM-based agents (Multi-LLM) have been utilized increasingly more for QA. In these scenarios, the models may each answer the question and reach a consensus or each model is specialized to answer different domain questions. However, most prior work dealing with Multi-LLM QA has focused on scenarios where the models are asked in a zero-shot manner or are given information sources to extract the answer. For question answering of an unknown environment, embodied exploration of the environment is first needed to answer the question. This skill is necessary for personalizing embodied AI to environments such as households. There is a lack of insight into whether a Multi-LLM system can handle question-answering based on observations from embodied exploration. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the use of Multi-Embodied LLM Explorers (MELE) for QA in an unknown environment. Multiple LLM-based agents independently explore and then answer queries about a household environment. We analyze different aggregation methods to generate a single, final answer for each query: debating, majority voting, and training a central answer module (CAM). Using CAM, we observe a $46\%$ higher accuracy compared against the other non-learning-based aggregation methods. We provide code and the query dataset for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Through this unified latent action space, IGOR enables knowledge transfer among large-scale robot and human activity data. We achieve this by compressing visual changes between an initial image and its goal state into latent actions. IGOR allows us to generate latent action labels for internet-scale video data. This unified latent action space enables the training of foundation policy and world models across a wide variety of tasks performed by both robots and humans. We demonstrate that: (1) IGOR learns a semantically consistent action space for both human and robots, characterizing various possible motions of objects representing the physical interaction knowledge; (2) IGOR can "migrate" the movements of the object in the one video to other videos, even across human and robots, by jointly using the latent action model and world model; (3) IGOR can learn to align latent actions with natural language through the foundation policy model, and integrate latent actions with a low-level policy model to achieve effective robot control. We believe IGOR opens new possibilities for human-to-robot knowledge transfer and control.</p></details> |  |

We present BestMan, a simulation platform based on PyBullet, designed to address these issues. BestMan introduces an integrated multilevel skill chain for seamless coordination across perception, planning, and control; a highly modular architecture for flexible algorithm integration; unified interfaces for smooth simulation-to-reality transfer; and a hardware-agnostic approach for adapting to various mobile manipulator configurations. These features collectively simplify development and enhance platform expandability, making BestMan a valuable tool for Embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

Majority of prior arts adhere to an open-loop philosophy and lack real-time feedback, leading to error accumulation and undesirable robustness. A handful of approaches have endeavored to establish feedback mechanisms leveraging pixel-level differences or pre-trained visual representations, yet their efficacy and adaptability have been found to be constrained. Inspired by classic closed-loop control systems, we propose CLOVER, a closed-loop visuomotor control framework that incorporates feedback mechanisms to improve adaptive robotic control. CLOVER consists of a text-conditioned video diffusion model for generating visual plans as reference inputs, a measurable embedding space for accurate error quantification, and a feedback-driven controller that refines actions from feedback and initiates replans as needed. Our framework exhibits notable advancement in real-world robotic tasks and achieves state-of-the-art on CALVIN benchmark, improving by 8% over previous open-loop counterparts.

Building on previous work, EgoThink, we introduce VidEgoThink, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating egocentric video understanding capabilities. To bridge the gap between MLLMs and low-level control in Embodied AI, we design four key interrelated tasks: video question-answering, hierarchy planning, visual grounding and reward modeling. To minimize manual annotation costs, we develop an automatic data generation pipeline based on the Ego4D dataset, leveraging the prior knowledge and multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o. Three human annotators then filter the generated data to ensure diversity and quality, resulting in the VidEgoThink benchmark. We conduct extensive experiments with three types of models: API-based MLLMs, open-source image-based MLLMs, and open-source video-based MLLMs. Experimental results indicate that all MLLMs, including GPT-4o, perform poorly across all tasks related to egocentric video understanding. These findings suggest that foundation models still require significant advancements to be effectively applied to first-person scenarios in Embodied AI. In conclusion, VidEgoThink reflects a research trend towards employing MLLMs for egocentric vision, akin to human capabilities, enabling active observation and interaction in the complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[M2Diffuser: Diffusion-based Trajectory Optimization for Mobile Manipulation in 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11402v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have opened new avenues for research into embodied AI agents and robotics. Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation-a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation-remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[EgoChoir: Capturing 3D Human-Object Interaction Regions from Egocentric Views](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13659v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding egocentric human-object interaction (HOI) is a fundamental aspect of human-centric perception, facilitating applications like AR/VR and embodied AI. For the egocentric HOI, in addition to perceiving semantics e.g., ''what'' interaction is occurring, capturing ''where'' the interaction specifically manifests in 3D space is also crucial, which links the perception and operation. Existing methods primarily leverage observations of HOI to capture interaction regions from an exocentric view. However, incomplete observations of interacting parties in the egocentric view introduce ambiguity between visual observations and interaction contents, impairing their efficacy. From the egocentric view, humans integrate the visual cortex, cerebellum, and brain to internalize their intentions and interaction concepts of objects, allowing for the pre-formulation of interactions and making behaviors even when interaction regions are out of sight. In light of this, we propose harmonizing the visual appearance, head motion, and 3D object to excavate the object interaction concept and subject intention, jointly inferring 3D human contact and object affordance from egocentric videos. To achieve this, we present EgoChoir, which links object structures with interaction contexts inherent in appearance and head motion to reveal object affordance, further utilizing it to model human contact. Additionally, a gradient modulation is employed to adopt appropriate clues for capturing interaction regions across various egocentric scenarios. Moreover, 3D contact and affordance are annotated for egocentric videos collected from Ego-Exo4D and GIMO to support the task. Extensive experiments on them demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of EgoChoir.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2024, project: https://yyvhang.github.io/EgoChoir/</p></details> |

Accomplishing this goal requires learning to ground language in perception and embodied actions, in order to accomplish complex tasks. The Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project tackles this by training agents to follow free-form instructions across a diverse range of virtual 3D environments, including curated research environments as well as open-ended, commercial video games. Our goal is to develop an instructable agent that can accomplish anything a human can do in any simulated 3D environment. Our approach focuses on language-driven generality while imposing minimal assumptions. Our agents interact with environments in real-time using a generic, human-like interface: the inputs are image observations and language instructions and the outputs are keyboard-and-mouse actions. This general approach is challenging, but it allows agents to ground language across many visually complex and semantically rich environments while also allowing us to readily run agents in new environments. In this paper we describe our motivation and goal, the initial progress we have made, and promising preliminary results on several diverse research environments and a variety of commercial video games.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Robotics and Embodied AI make public urban spaces no longer exclusive to humans. Food delivery bots and electric wheelchairs have started sharing sidewalks with pedestrians, while robot dogs and humanoids have recently emerged in the street. Micromobility enabled by AI for short-distance travel in public urban spaces plays a crucial component in the future transportation system. Ensuring the generalizability and safety of AI models maneuvering mobile machines is essential. In this work, we present MetaUrban, a compositional simulation platform for the AI-driven urban micromobility research. MetaUrban can construct an infinite number of interactive urban scenes from compositional elements, covering a vast array of ground plans, object placements, pedestrians, vulnerable road users, and other mobile agents' appearances and dynamics. We design point navigation and social navigation tasks as the pilot study using MetaUrban for urban micromobility research and establish various baselines of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. We conduct extensive evaluation across mobile machines, demonstrating that heterogeneous mechanical structures significantly influence the learning and execution of AI policies. We perform a thorough ablation study, showing that the compositional nature of the simulated environments can substantially improve the generalizability and safety of the trained mobile agents. MetaUrban will be made publicly available to provide research opportunities and foster safe and trustworthy embodied AI and micromobility in cities.

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

Hand motion models with the sophistication to accurately recreate piano playing have a wide range of applications in character animation, embodied AI, biomechanics, and VR/AR. In this paper, we construct a first-of-its-kind large-scale dataset that contains approximately 10 hours of 3D hand motion and audio from 15 elite-level pianists playing 153 pieces of classical music. To capture natural performances, we designed a markerless setup in which motions are reconstructed from multi-view videos using state-of-the-art pose estimation models. The motion data is further refined via inverse kinematics using the high-resolution MIDI key-pressing data obtained from sensors in a specialized Yamaha Disklavier piano. Leveraging the collected dataset, we developed a pipeline that can synthesize physically-plausible hand motions for musical scores outside of the dataset. Our approach employs a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning to obtain policies for physics-based bimanual control involving the interaction between hands and piano keys. To solve the sampling efficiency problem with the large motion dataset, we use a diffusion model to generate natural reference motions, which provide high-level trajectory and fingering (finger order and placement) information. However, the generated reference motion alone does not provide sufficient accuracy for piano performance modeling. We then further augmented the data by using musical similarity to retrieve similar motions from the captured dataset to boost the precision of the RL policy. With the proposed method, our model generates natural, dexterous motions that generalize to music from outside the training dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2024.

| **[Learning the Generalizable Manipulation Skills on Soft-body Tasks via Guided Self-attention Behavior Cloning Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05756v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI represents a paradigm in AI research where artificial agents are situated within and interact with physical or virtual environments. Despite the recent progress in Embodied AI, it is still very challenging to learn the generalizable manipulation skills that can handle large deformation and topological changes on soft-body objects, such as clay, water, and soil. In this work, we proposed an effective policy, namely GP2E behavior cloning policy, which can guide the agent to learn the generalizable manipulation skills from soft-body tasks, including pouring, filling, hanging, excavating, pinching, and writing. Concretely, we build our policy from three insights:(1) Extracting intricate semantic features from point cloud data and seamlessly integrating them into the robot's end-effector frame; (2) Capturing long-distance interactions in long-horizon tasks through the incorporation of our guided self-attention module; (3) Mitigating overfitting concerns and facilitating model convergence to higher accuracy levels via the introduction of our two-stage fine-tuning strategy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving the 1st prize in the soft-body track of the ManiSkill2 Challenge at the CVPR 2023 4th Embodied AI workshop. Our findings highlight the potential of our method to improve the generalization abilities of Embodied AI models and pave the way for their practical applications in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-Aware Transformer Networks for Robotic Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02669v2)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research in Visual Navigation reveals opportunities for improvement. First, the direct adoption of RNNs and Transformers often overlooks the specific differences between Embodied AI and traditional sequential data modelling, potentially limiting its performance in Embodied AI tasks. Second, the reliance on task-specific configurations, such as pre-trained modules and dataset-specific logic, compromises the generalizability of these methods. We address these constraints by initially exploring the unique differences between Navigation tasks and other sequential data tasks through the lens of Causality, presenting a causal framework to elucidate the inadequacies of conventional sequential methods for Navigation. By leveraging this causal perspective, we propose Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) Networks for Navigation, featuring a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the models's Environmental Understanding capability. Meanwhile, our method is devoid of task-specific inductive biases and can be trained in an End-to-End manner, which enhances the method's generalizability across various contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology consistently surpasses benchmark performances across a spectrum of settings, tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablation studies reveal that the performance gains can be attributed to the Causal Understanding Module, which demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in both Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning settings.</p></details> |  |

Exploring Backdoor Attacks against Embodied LLM-based Decision-Making Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20774v2)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in real-world decision-making tasks for embodied artificial intelligence, especially when fine-tuned to leverage their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities while being tailored to specific applications. However, this fine-tuning process introduces considerable safety and security vulnerabilities, especially in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-based Decision-making systems (BALD) in embodied AI, systematically exploring the attack surfaces and trigger mechanisms. Specifically, we propose three distinct attack mechanisms: word injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection, targeting various components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline. We perform extensive experiments on representative LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2) in autonomous driving and home robot tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and stealthiness of our backdoor triggers across various attack channels, with cases like vehicles accelerating toward obstacles and robots placing knives on beds. Our word and knowledge injection attacks achieve nearly 100% success rate across multiple models and datasets while requiring only limited access to the system. Our scenario manipulation attack yields success rates exceeding 65%, reaching up to 90%, and does not require any runtime system intrusion. We also assess the robustness of these attacks against defenses, revealing their resilience. Our findings highlight critical security vulnerabilities in embodied LLM systems and emphasize the urgent need for safeguarding these systems to mitigate potential risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, including main paper, references, and appendix</p></details> |

However, there is still lack of study on how vision language models~(VLMs) behave when multi-modal task inputs are considered. Counterfactual planning that evaluates the model's reasoning ability over alternative task situations are also under exploited. In order to evaluate the planning ability of both multi-modal and counterfactual aspects, we propose ActPlan-1K. ActPlan-1K is a multi-modal planning benchmark constructed based on ChatGPT and household activity simulator iGibson2. The benchmark consists of 153 activities and 1,187 instances. Each instance describing one activity has a natural language task description and multiple environment images from the simulator. The gold plan of each instance is action sequences over the objects in provided scenes. Both the correctness and commonsense satisfaction are evaluated on typical VLMs. It turns out that current VLMs are still struggling at generating human-level procedural plans for both normal activities and counterfactual activities. We further provide automatic evaluation metrics by finetuning over BLEURT model to facilitate future research on our benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables, accepted to EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

With the advancement of embodied AI, robots are increasingly capable of satisfying human demands. Demand-driven navigation (DDN) is a task in which an agent must locate an object to satisfy a specified demand instruction, such as ``I am thirsty.'' The previous study typically assumes that each demand instruction requires only one object to be fulfilled and does not consider individual preferences. However, the realistic human demand may involve multiple objects. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-object Demand-driven Navigation (MO-DDN) benchmark, which addresses these nuanced aspects, including multi-object search and personal preferences, thus making the MO-DDN task more reflective of real-life scenarios compared to DDN. Building upon previous work, we employ the concept of ``attribute'' to tackle this new task. However, instead of solely relying on attribute features in an end-to-end manner like DDN, we propose a modular method that involves constructing a coarse-to-fine attribute-based exploration agent (C2FAgent). Our experimental results illustrate that this coarse-to-fine exploration strategy capitalizes on the advantages of attributes at various decision-making levels, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods.

For instance, a robot in an unfamiliar house initially wouldn't know the locations of objects needed for tasks and might perform inefficiently. However, as it gathers more experience, it should learn the layout of its environment and remember where objects are, allowing it to complete new tasks more efficiently. To enable such rapid adaptation to new tasks, we present ReLIC, a new approach for in-context reinforcement learning (RL) for embodied agents. With ReLIC, agents are capable of adapting to new environments using 64,000 steps of in-context experience with full attention while being trained through self-generated experience via RL. We achieve this by proposing a novel policy update scheme for on-policy RL called "partial updates'' as well as a Sink-KV mechanism that enables effective utilization of a long observation history for embodied agents. Our method outperforms a variety of meta-RL baselines in adapting to unseen houses in an embodied multi-object navigation task. In addition, we find that ReLIC is capable of few-shot imitation learning despite never being trained with expert demonstrations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of ReLIC, highlighting that the combination of large-scale RL training, the proposed partial updates scheme, and the Sink-KV are essential for effective in-context learning. The code for ReLIC and all our experiments is at https://github.com/aielawady/relic</p></details> |  |

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot. Warning: This paper contains harmful AI-generated language and aggressive actions.</p></details> | 38 pages, 16 figures |

However, real-world datasets often contain insufficient data to meet the training and evaluation requirements of models. Although synthetic datasets offer a larger volume of data, their acoustic simulations lack realism. Consequently, neither real-world nor synthetic datasets effectively fulfill practical needs. To address these issues, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit de-designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim is developed based on the embodied AI simulation platform, Habitat-sim, supporting multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level, thereby generating more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a moving sound source benchmark dataset, SonicSet, using the Librispeech, the Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K) and Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from the Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to validate the differences between synthetic data and real-world data, we randomly selected 5 hours of raw data without reverberation from the SonicSet validation set to record a real-world speech separation dataset, which was then compared with the corresponding synthetic datasets. Similarly, we utilized the real-world speech enhancement dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between other synthetic datasets and the SonicSet dataset for speech enhancement. The results indicate that the synthetic data generated by SonicSim can effectively generalize to real-world scenarios. Demo and code are publicly available at https://cslikai.cn/SonicSim/.</p></details> | Technical report |

This evolution has led to the development of the Vehicular Embodied AI NETwork (VEANET), where advanced AI capabilities are integrated into vehicular systems to enhance autonomous operations and decision-making. Embodied agents, such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are autonomous entities that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals, actively interacting with the physical world. Embodied twins are digital models of these embodied agents, with various embodied AI twins for intelligent applications in cyberspace. In VEANET, embodied AI twins act as in-vehicle AI assistants to perform diverse tasks supporting autonomous driving using generative AI models. Due to limited computational resources of AVs, these AVs often offload computationally intensive tasks, such as constructing and updating embodied AI twins, to nearby RSUs. However, since the rapid mobility of AVs and the limited provision coverage of a single RSU, embodied AI twins require dynamic migrations from current RSU to other RSUs in real-time, resulting in the challenge of selecting suitable RSUs for efficient embodied AI twins migrations. Given information asymmetry, AVs cannot know the detailed information of RSUs. To this end, in this paper, we construct a multi-dimensional contract theoretical model between AVs and alternative RSUs. Considering that AVs may exhibit irrational behavior, we utilize prospect theory instead of expected utility theory to model the actual utilities of AVs. Finally, we employ a generative diffusion model-based algorithm to identify the optimal contract designs. Compared with traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p></details> |  |

Extensive testing in simulation and physical hardware experiments with a resource-constrained wheeled robot tasked to navigate in a real-world environment validate the efficacy and robustness of our method.

This paper introduces a two-stage knowledge distillation framework, producing a student model, MiniVLN, and showcasing the significant potential of distillation techniques in developing lightweight models. The proposed method aims to capture fine-grained knowledge during the pretraining phase and navigation-specific knowledge during the fine-tuning phase. Our findings indicate that the two-stage distillation approach is more effective in narrowing the performance gap between the teacher model and the student model compared to single-stage distillation.

To address these problems, we present AIR-Embodied, a novel framework that integrates embodied AI agents with large-scale pretrained multi-modal language models to improve active 3DGS reconstruction. AIR-Embodied utilizes a three-stage process: understanding the current reconstruction state via multi-modal prompts, planning tasks with viewpoint selection and interactive actions, and employing closed-loop reasoning to ensure accurate execution. The agent dynamically refines its actions based on discrepancies between the planned and actual outcomes. Experimental evaluations across virtual and real-world environments demonstrate that AIR-Embodied significantly enhances reconstruction efficiency and quality, providing a robust solution to challenges in active 3D reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReLEP: A Novel Framework for Real-world Long-horizon Embodied Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15658v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world long-horizon embodied planning underpins embodied AI. To accomplish long-horizon tasks, agents need to decompose abstract instructions into detailed steps. Prior works mostly rely on GPT-4V for task decomposition into predefined actions, which limits task diversity due to GPT-4V's finite understanding of larger skillsets. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a groundbreaking framework for Real world Long-horizon Embodied Planning, which can accomplish a wide range of daily tasks. At its core lies a fine-tuned large vision language model that formulates plans as sequences of skill functions according to input instruction and scene image. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a semi-automatic data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. Real-world off-line experiments across eight daily embodied tasks demonstrate that ReLEP is able to accomplish long-horizon embodied tasks and outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[KARMA: Augmenting Embodied AI Agents with Long-and-short Term Memory Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14908v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI agents responsible for executing interconnected, long-sequence household tasks often face difficulties with in-context memory, leading to inefficiencies and errors in task execution. To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KARMA's plug-and-play capability allows for seamless deployment on real-world robotic systems, such as mobile manipulation platforms.Through this plug-and-play memory system, KARMA significantly enhances the ability of embodied agents to generate coherent and contextually appropriate plans, making the execution of complex household tasks more efficient.

| **[Cog-GA: A Large Language Models-based Generative Agent for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02522v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) represents a frontier in embodied AI, demanding agents to navigate freely in unbounded 3D spaces solely guided by natural language instructions. This task introduces distinct challenges in multimodal comprehension, spatial reasoning, and decision-making. To address these challenges, we introduce Cog-GA, a generative agent founded on large language models (LLMs) tailored for VLN-CE tasks. Cog-GA employs a dual-pronged strategy to emulate human-like cognitive processes. Firstly, it constructs a cognitive map, integrating temporal, spatial, and semantic elements, thereby facilitating the development of spatial memory within LLMs. Secondly, Cog-GA employs a predictive mechanism for waypoints, strategically optimizing the exploration trajectory to maximize navigational efficiency. Each waypoint is accompanied by a dual-channel scene description, categorizing environmental cues into 'what' and 'where' streams as the brain. This segregation enhances the agent's attentional focus, enabling it to discern pertinent spatial information for navigation. A reflective mechanism complements these strategies by capturing feedback from prior navigation experiences, facilitating continual learning and adaptive replanning. Extensive evaluations conducted on VLN-CE benchmarks validate Cog-GA's state-of-the-art performance and ability to simulate human-like navigation behaviors. This research significantly contributes to the development of strategic and interpretable VLN-CE agents.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose SpatialBot for better spatial understanding by feeding both RGB and depth images. Additionally, we have constructed the SpatialQA dataset, which involves multi-level depth-related questions to train VLMs for depth understanding. Finally, we present SpatialBench to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' capabilities in spatial understanding at different levels. Extensive experiments on our spatial-understanding benchmark, general VLM benchmarks and Embodied AI tasks, demonstrate the remarkable improvements of SpatialBot trained on SpatialQA.

| **[P-RAG: Progressive Retrieval Augmented Generation For Planning on Embodied Everyday Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11279v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Everyday Task is a popular task in the embodied AI community, requiring agents to make a sequence of actions based on natural language instructions and visual observations. Traditional learning-based approaches face two challenges. Firstly, natural language instructions often lack explicit task planning. Secondly, extensive training is required to equip models with knowledge of the task environment. Previous works based on Large Language Model (LLM) either suffer from poor performance due to the lack of task-specific knowledge or rely on ground truth as few-shot samples. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel approach called Progressive Retrieval Augmented Generation (P-RAG), which not only effectively leverages the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs but also progressively accumulates task-specific knowledge without ground-truth. Compared to the conventional RAG methods, which retrieve relevant information from the database in a one-shot manner to assist generation, P-RAG introduces an iterative approach to progressively update the database. In each iteration, P-RAG retrieves the latest database and obtains historical information from the previous interaction as experiential references for the current interaction. Moreover, we also introduce a more granular retrieval scheme that not only retrieves similar tasks but also incorporates retrieval of similar situations to provide more valuable reference experiences. Extensive experiments reveal that P-RAG achieves competitive results without utilizing ground truth and can even further improve performance through self-iterations.</p></details> |  |

While current models show promising results, they are typically trained and tested on clean data, potentially overlooking the corruption during real-world deployment and thus posing safety risks in practical scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce PoseBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of pose estimation models against real-world corruption. We evaluated 60 representative models, including top-down, bottom-up, heatmap-based, regression-based, and classification-based methods, across three datasets for human and animal pose estimation. Our evaluation involves 10 types of corruption in four categories: 1) blur and noise, 2) compression and color loss, 3) severe lighting, and 4) masks. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art models are vulnerable to common real-world corruptions and exhibit distinct behaviors when tackling human and animal pose estimation tasks. To improve model robustness, we delve into various design considerations, including input resolution, pre-training datasets, backbone capacity, post-processing, and data augmentations. We hope that our benchmark will serve as a foundation for advancing research in robust pose estimation. The benchmark and source code will be released at https://xymsh.github.io/PoseBench</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

Timely Tracking of a Joint Markov Source with Model Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13099v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the problem of remote estimation of a discrete-time joint Markov process using multiple sensors. Each sensor observes a different component of the joint Markov process, and in each time slot, the monitor obtains a partial state value by sending a pull request to one of the sensors. The monitor chooses the sequence of sensors to observe with the goal of minimizing the mean of age of incorrect information (MAoII) by using the partial state observations obtained, which have different freshness levels. For instance, a monitor may be interested in tracking the location of an object by obtaining observations from two sensors, which observe the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the object separately, in different time slots. The monitor, then, needs to decide which coordinate to observe in the next time slot given the history. In addition to this partial observability of the state of Markov process, there is an erasure channel with a fixed one-slot delay between each sensor and the monitor. First, we obtain a sufficient statistic, namely the \emph{belief}, representing the joint distribution of the age of incorrect information (AoII) and the current state of the observed process by using the history of all pull requests and observations. Then, we formulate the problem with a continuous state-space Markov decision problem (MDP), namely belief MDP. To solve the problem, we propose two model predictive control (MPC) methods, namely MPC without terminal costs (MPC-WTC) and reinforcement learning MPC (RL-MPC), that have different advantages in implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-Driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Particle Filtering for Source Localization in Dynamic Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13084v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world scenarios, such as gas leak detection or environmental pollutant tracking, solving the Inverse Source Localization and Characterization problem involves navigating complex, dynamic fields with sparse and noisy observations. Traditional methods face significant challenges, including partial observability, temporal and spatial dynamics, out-of-distribution generalization, and reward sparsity. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical framework that integrates Bayesian inference and reinforcement learning. The framework leverages an attention-enhanced particle filtering mechanism for efficient and accurate belief updates, and incorporates two complementary execution strategies: Attention Particle Filtering Planning and Attention Particle Filtering Reinforcement Learning. These approaches optimize exploration and adaptation under uncertainty. Theoretical analysis proves the convergence of the attention-enhanced particle filter, while extensive experiments across diverse scenarios validate the framework's superior accuracy, adaptability, and computational efficiency. Our results highlight the framework's potential for broad applications in dynamic field estimation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution and The Knightian Blindspot of Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13075v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper claims that machine learning (ML) largely overlooks an important facet of general intelligence: robustness to a qualitatively unknown future in an open world. Such robustness relates to Knightian uncertainty (KU) in economics, i.e. uncertainty that cannot be quantified, which is excluded from consideration in ML's key formalisms. This paper aims to identify this blind spot, argue its importance, and catalyze research into addressing it, which we believe is necessary to create truly robust open-world AI. To help illuminate the blind spot, we contrast one area of ML, reinforcement learning (RL), with the process of biological evolution. Despite staggering ongoing progress, RL still struggles in open-world situations, often failing under unforeseen situations. For example, the idea of zero-shot transferring a self-driving car policy trained only in the US to the UK currently seems exceedingly ambitious. In dramatic contrast, biological evolution routinely produces agents that thrive within an open world, sometimes even to situations that are remarkably out-of-distribution (e.g. invasive species; or humans, who do undertake such zero-shot international driving). Interestingly, evolution achieves such robustness without explicit theory, formalisms, or mathematical gradients. We explore the assumptions underlying RL's typical formalisms, showing how they limit RL's engagement with the unknown unknowns characteristic of an ever-changing complex world. Further, we identify mechanisms through which evolutionary processes foster robustness to novel and unpredictable challenges, and discuss potential pathways to algorithmically embody them. The conclusion is that the intriguing remaining fragility of ML may result from blind spots in its formalisms, and that significant gains may result from direct confrontation with the challenge of KU.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaWM: Adaptive World Model based Planning for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13072v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World model based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for autonomous driving, which learns a latent dynamics model and uses it to train a planning policy. To speed up the learning process, the pretrain-finetune paradigm is often used, where online RL is initialized by a pretrained model and a policy learned offline. However, naively performing such initialization in RL may result in dramatic performance degradation during the online interactions in the new task. To tackle this challenge, we first analyze the performance degradation and identify two primary root causes therein: the mismatch of the planning policy and the mismatch of the dynamics model, due to distribution shift. We further analyze the effects of these factors on performance degradation during finetuning, and our findings reveal that the choice of finetuning strategies plays a pivotal role in mitigating these effects. We then introduce AdaWM, an Adaptive World Model based planning method, featuring two key steps: (a) mismatch identification, which quantifies the mismatches and informs the finetuning strategy, and (b) alignment-driven finetuning, which selectively updates either the policy or the model as needed using efficient low-rank updates. Extensive experiments on the challenging CARLA driving tasks demonstrate that AdaWM significantly improves the finetuning process, resulting in more robust and efficient performance in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Reasoning Language Models: A Blueprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11223v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning language models (RLMs), also known as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and o3, DeepSeek-V3, and Alibaba's QwQ, have redefined AI's problem-solving capabilities by extending LLMs with advanced reasoning mechanisms. Yet, their high costs, proprietary nature, and complex architectures - uniquely combining Reinforcement Learning (RL), search heuristics, and LLMs - present accessibility and scalability challenges. To address these, we propose a comprehensive blueprint that organizes RLM components into a modular framework, based on a survey and analysis of all RLM works. This blueprint incorporates diverse reasoning structures (chains, trees, graphs, and nested forms), reasoning strategies (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search, Beam Search), RL concepts (policy, value models and others), supervision schemes (Outcome-Based and Process-Based Supervision), and other related concepts (e.g., Test-Time Compute, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, agent tools). We provide detailed mathematical formulations and algorithmic specifications to simplify RLM implementation. By showing how schemes like LLaMA-Berry, QwQ, Journey Learning, and Graph of Thoughts fit as special cases, we demonstrate the blueprint's versatility and unifying potential. To illustrate its utility, we introduce x1, a modular implementation for rapid RLM prototyping and experimentation. Using x1 and a literature review, we provide key insights, such as multi-phase training for policy and value models, and the importance of familiar training distributions. Finally, we discuss scalable RLM cloud deployments and we outline how RLMs can integrate with a broader LLM ecosystem. Our work demystifies RLM construction, democratizes advanced reasoning capabilities, and fosters innovation, aiming to mitigate the gap between "rich AI" and "poor AI" by lowering barriers to RLM development and experimentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Return Distributions with Distributional Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13028v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce distributional dynamic programming (DP) methods for optimizing statistical functionals of the return distribution, with standard reinforcement learning as a special case. Previous distributional DP methods could optimize the same class of expected utilities as classic DP. To go beyond expected utilities, we combine distributional DP with stock augmentation, a technique previously introduced for classic DP in the context of risk-sensitive RL, where the MDP state is augmented with a statistic of the rewards obtained so far (since the first time step). We find that a number of recently studied problems can be formulated as stock-augmented return distribution optimization, and we show that we can use distributional DP to solve them. We analyze distributional value and policy iteration, with bounds and a study of what objectives these distributional DP methods can or cannot optimize. We describe a number of applications outlining how to use distributional DP to solve different stock-augmented return distribution optimization problems, for example maximizing conditional value-at-risk, and homeostatic regulation. To highlight the practical potential of stock-augmented return distribution optimization and distributional DP, we combine the core ideas of distributional value iteration with the deep RL agent DQN, and empirically evaluate it for solving instances of the applications discussed.</p></details> |  |

We propose a training method which avoids agents learning undesired multi-step plans that receive high reward (multi-step "reward hacks") even if humans are not able to detect that the behaviour is undesired. The method, Myopic Optimization with Non-myopic Approval (MONA), works by combining short-sighted optimization with far-sighted reward. We demonstrate that MONA can prevent multi-step reward hacking that ordinary RL causes, even without being able to detect the reward hacking and without any extra information that ordinary RL does not get access to. We study MONA empirically in three settings which model different misalignment failure modes including 2-step environments with LLMs representing delegated oversight and encoded reasoning and longer-horizon gridworld environments representing sensor tampering.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Radio Resource Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12991v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) addresses key limitations of online MARL, such as safety concerns, expensive data collection, extended training intervals, and high signaling overhead caused by online interactions with the environment. In this work, we propose an offline MARL algorithm for radio resource management (RRM), focusing on optimizing scheduling policies for multiple access points (APs) to jointly maximize the sum and tail rates of user equipment (UEs). We evaluate three training paradigms: centralized, independent, and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed offline MARL framework outperforms conventional baseline approaches, achieving over a 15\% improvement in a weighted combination of sum and tail rates. Additionally, the CTDE framework strikes an effective balance, reducing the computational complexity of centralized methods while addressing the inefficiencies of independent training. These results underscore the potential of offline MARL to deliver scalable, robust, and efficient solutions for resource management in dynamic wireless networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decision Mamba: A Multi-Grained State Space Model with Self-Evolution Regularization for Offline RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05427v3)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the conditional sequence modeling with the transformer architecture has demonstrated its effectiveness in dealing with offline reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, it is struggle to handle out-of-distribution states and actions. Existing work attempts to address this issue by data augmentation with the learned policy or adding extra constraints with the value-based RL algorithm. However, these studies still fail to overcome the following challenges: (1) insufficiently utilizing the historical temporal information among inter-steps, (2) overlooking the local intrastep relationships among return-to-gos (RTGs), states, and actions, (3) overfitting suboptimal trajectories with noisy labels. To address these challenges, we propose Decision Mamba (DM), a novel multi-grained state space model (SSM) with a self-evolving policy learning strategy. DM explicitly models the historical hidden state to extract the temporal information by using the mamba architecture. To capture the relationship among RTG-state-action triplets, a fine-grained SSM module is designed and integrated into the original coarse-grained SSM in mamba, resulting in a novel mamba architecture tailored for offline RL. Finally, to mitigate the overfitting issue on noisy trajectories, a self-evolving policy is proposed by using progressive regularization. The policy evolves by using its own past knowledge to refine the suboptimal actions, thus enhancing its robustness on noisy demonstrations. Extensive experiments on various tasks show that DM outperforms other baselines substantially.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024; Code is available at https://github.com/aopolin-lv/DecisionMamba</p></details> |

DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Critic-Guided Diffusion Policy for Multi-User Delay-Constrained Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12942v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective multi-user delay-constrained scheduling is crucial in various real-world applications, such as instant messaging, live streaming, and data center management. In these scenarios, schedulers must make real-time decisions to satisfy both delay and resource constraints without prior knowledge of system dynamics, which are often time-varying and challenging to estimate. Current learning-based methods typically require interactions with actual systems during the training stage, which can be difficult or impractical, as it is capable of significantly degrading system performance and incurring substantial service costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel offline reinforcement learning-based algorithm, named \underline{S}cheduling By \underline{O}ffline Learning with \underline{C}ritic Guidance and \underline{D}iffusion Generation (SOCD), to learn efficient scheduling policies purely from pre-collected \emph{offline data}. SOCD innovatively employs a diffusion-based policy network, complemented by a sampling-free critic network for policy guidance. By integrating the Lagrangian multiplier optimization into the offline reinforcement learning, SOCD effectively trains high-quality constraint-aware policies exclusively from available datasets, eliminating the need for online interactions with the system. Experimental results demonstrate that SOCD is resilient to various system dynamics, including partially observable and large-scale environments, and delivers superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences.

| **[Reinforcement learning Based Automated Design of Differential Evolution Algorithm for Black-box Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12881v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential evolution (DE) algorithm is recognized as one of the most effective evolutionary algorithms, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in black-box optimization due to its derivative-free nature. Numerous enhancements to the fundamental DE have been proposed, incorporating innovative mutation strategies and sophisticated parameter tuning techniques to improve performance. However, no single variant has proven universally superior across all problems. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that employs reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically design DE for black-box optimization through meta-learning. RL acts as an advanced meta-optimizer, generating a customized DE configuration that includes an optimal initialization strategy, update rule, and hyperparameters tailored to a specific black-box optimization problem. This process is informed by a detailed analysis of the problem characteristics. In this proof-of-concept study, we utilize a double deep Q-network for implementation, considering a subset of 40 possible strategy combinations and parameter optimizations simultaneously. The framework's performance is evaluated against black-box optimization benchmarks and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results highlight the promising potential of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entropy Regularized Task Representation Learning for Offline Meta-Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14834v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline meta-reinforcement learning aims to equip agents with the ability to rapidly adapt to new tasks by training on data from a set of different tasks. Context-based approaches utilize a history of state-action-reward transitions -- referred to as the context -- to infer representations of the current task, and then condition the agent, i.e., the policy and value function, on the task representations. Intuitively, the better the task representations capture the underlying tasks, the better the agent can generalize to new tasks. Unfortunately, context-based approaches suffer from distribution mismatch, as the context in the offline data does not match the context at test time, limiting their ability to generalize to the test tasks. This leads to the task representations overfitting to the offline training data. Intuitively, the task representations should be independent of the behavior policy used to collect the offline data. To address this issue, we approximately minimize the mutual information between the distribution over the task representations and behavior policy by maximizing the entropy of behavior policy conditioned on the task representations. We validate our approach in MuJoCo environments, showing that compared to baselines, our task representations more faithfully represent the underlying tasks, leading to outperforming prior methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[To Measure or Not: A Cost-Sensitive, Selective Measuring Environment for Agricultural Management Decisions with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12823v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Farmers rely on in-field observations to make well-informed crop management decisions to maximize profit and minimize adverse environmental impact. However, obtaining real-world crop state measurements is labor-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. In most cases, it is not feasible to gather crop state measurements before every decision moment. Moreover, in previous research pertaining to farm management optimization, these observations are often assumed to be readily available without any cost, which is unrealistic. Hence, enabling optimization without the need to have temporally complete crop state observations is important. An approach to that problem is to include measuring as part of decision making. As a solution, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to recommend opportune moments to simultaneously measure crop features and apply nitrogen fertilizer. With realistic considerations, we design an RL environment with explicit crop feature measuring costs. While balancing costs, we find that an RL agent, trained with recurrent PPO, discovers adaptive measuring policies that follow critical crop development stages, with results aligned by what domain experts would consider a sensible approach. Our results highlight the importance of measuring when crop feature measurements are not readily available.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, accepted after peer-review at the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AI for Social Impact Track, February 2025, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA</p></details> |

We commence by investigating how reward functions and policies generalize in LfO. Subsequently, the built-in reinforcement learning (RL) approach in generative adversarial imitation from observation (GAIfO) is replaced with distributional soft actor-critic (DSAC). This change results in a novel algorithm called Mimicking Observations through Distributional Update Learning with adequate Exploration (MODULE), which combines soft actor-critic's superior efficiency with distributional RL's robust stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cost Optimization for Serverless Edge Computing with Budget Constraints using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12783v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing adopts a pay-as-you-go billing model where applications are executed in stateless and shortlived containers triggered by events, resulting in a reduction of monetary costs and resource utilization. However, existing platforms do not provide an upper bound for the billing model which makes the overall cost unpredictable, precluding many organizations from managing their budgets. Due to the diverse ranges of serverless functions and the heterogeneous capacity of edge devices, it is challenging to receive near-optimal solutions for deployment cost in a polynomial time. In this paper, we investigated the function scheduling problem with a budget constraint for serverless computing in wireless networks. Users and IoT devices are sending requests to edge nodes, improving the latency perceived by users. We propose two online scheduling algorithms based on reinforcement learning, incorporating several important characteristics of serverless functions. Via extensive simulations, we justify the superiority of the proposed algorithm by comparing with an ILP solver (Midaco). Our results indicate that the proposed algorithms efficiently approximate the results of Midaco within a factor of 1.03 while our decision-making time is 5 orders of magnitude less than that of Midaco.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE ICC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Sequential Decision-Making in Geosteering: A Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04772v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory adjustment decisions throughout the drilling process, called geosteering, affect subsequent choices and information gathering, thus resulting in a coupled sequential decision problem. Previous works on applying decision optimization methods in geosteering rely on greedy optimization or approximate dynamic programming (ADP). Either decision optimization method requires explicit uncertainty and objective function models, making developing decision optimization methods for complex and realistic geosteering environments challenging to impossible. We use the Deep Q-Network (DQN) method, a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) method that learns directly from the decision environment, to optimize geosteering decisions. The expensive computations for RL are handled during the offline training stage. Evaluating DQN needed for real-time decision support takes milliseconds and is faster than the traditional alternatives. Moreover, for two previously published synthetic geosteering scenarios, our results show that RL achieves high-quality outcomes comparable to the quasi-optimal ADP. Yet, the model-free nature of RL means that by replacing the training environment, we can extend it to problems where the solution to ADP is prohibitively expensive to compute. This flexibility will allow applying it to more complex environments and make hybrid versions trained with real data in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Preference Alignment for Language Models via Count-based Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12735v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown great potential in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to align with human preferences. Existing methods perform preference alignment from a fixed dataset, which can be limited in data coverage, and the resulting reward model is hard to generalize in out-of-distribution responses. Thus, online RLHF is more desirable to empower the LLM to explore outside the support of the initial dataset by iteratively collecting the prompt-response pairs. In this paper, we study the fundamental problem in online RLHF, i.e. \emph{how to explore} for LLM. We give a theoretical motivation in linear reward assumption to show that an optimistic reward with an upper confidence bound (UCB) term leads to a provably efficient RLHF policy. Then, we reformulate our objective to direct preference optimization with an exploration term, where the UCB-term can be converted to a count-based exploration bonus. We further propose a practical algorithm, named \emph{Count-based Online Preference Optimization (COPO)}, which leverages a simple coin-flip counting module to estimate the pseudo-count of a prompt-response pair in previously collected data. COPO encourages LLMs to balance exploration and preference optimization in an iterative manner, which enlarges the exploration space and the entire data coverage of iterative LLM policies. We conduct online RLHF experiments on Zephyr and Llama-3 models. The results on instruction-following and standard academic benchmarks show that COPO significantly increases performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mixed Preference Optimization: Reinforcement Learning with Data Selection and Better Reference Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19443v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to process and generate natural language. However, as they are trained on massive datasets of text, LLMs can inherit harmful biases and produce outputs that are not aligned with human values. This paper studies two main approaches to LLM alignment: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and contrastive learning-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). By analyzing the stability and robustness of RLHF and DPO, we propose MPO (Mixed Preference Optimization), a novel method that mitigates the weaknesses of both approaches. Specifically, we propose a two-stage training procedure: first train DPO on an easy dataset, and then perform RLHF on a difficult set with DPO model being the reference model. Here, the easy and difficult sets are constructed by a well-trained reward model that splits response pairs into those with large gaps of reward (easy), and those with small gaps (difficult). The first stage allows us to obtain a relatively optimal policy (LLM) model quickly, whereas the second stage refines LLM with online RLHF, thus mitigating the distribution shift issue associated with DPO. Experiments are conducted on two public alignment datasets, namely HH-RLHF and TLDR, demonstrating the effectiveness of MPO, both in terms of GPT4 and human evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous approaches that focused on trajectory collection and actor-critic updates, HEPPO addresses GAE's computational demands with a parallel, pipelined architecture implemented on a single System-on-Chip (SoC). This design allows for the adaptation of various hardware accelerators tailored for different PPO phases. A key innovation is our strategic standardization technique, which combines dynamic reward standardization and block standardization for values, followed by 8-bit uniform quantization. This method stabilizes learning, enhances performance, and manages memory bottlenecks, achieving a 4x reduction in memory usage and a 1.5x increase in cumulative rewards. We propose a solution on a single SoC device with programmable logic and embedded processors, delivering throughput orders of magnitude higher than traditional CPU-GPU systems. Our single-chip solution minimizes communication latency and throughput bottlenecks, significantly boosting PPO training efficiency. Experimental results show a 30% increase in PPO speed and a substantial reduction in memory access time, underscoring HEPPO's potential for broad applicability in hardware-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2024 International Conference on Field Programmable Technology (ICFPT 2023)</p></details> |

While such dialogue systems have been developing rapidly with the help of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) has attracted attention to align LLM-based dialogue models for such dialogue impressions. In RLAIF, a reward model based on another LLM is used to create a training signal for an LLM-based dialogue model using zero-shot/few-shot prompting techniques. However, evaluating an entire dialogue only by prompting LLMs is challenging. In this study, the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs prepared reward models corresponding to 12 metrics related to the impression of the entire dialogue for evaluating dialogue responses. We tuned our dialogue models using the reward model signals as feedback to improve the impression of the system. The results of automatic and human evaluations showed that tuning the dialogue model using our reward model corresponding to dialogue impression improved the evaluation of individual metrics and the naturalness of the dialogue response.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose a novel merging control scheme based on reinforcement learning, which integrates lateral control mechanisms. This approach ensures the smooth integration of vehicles from the merging lane onto the main road, optimizing both fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Furthermore, we recognize the impact of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication on control strategies and introduce an enhanced protocol leveraging Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Mode 4. This protocol aims to reduce the Age of Information (AoI) and improve communication reliability. In our simulations, we employ two AoI-based metrics to rigorously assess the protocol's effectiveness in autonomous driving scenarios. By combining the NS3 network simulator with Python, we simulate V2V communication and vehicle control simultaneously. The results demonstrate that the enhanced C-V2X Mode 4 outperforms the standard version, while the proposed control scheme ensures safe and reliable vehicle operation during on-ramp merging.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Journal.

Furthermore, the advent of REST API documentation languages, such as the OpenAPI Specification, has led to the emergence of many black-box REST API testing tools. However, these tools often focus on individual test elements in isolation (e.g., APIs, parameters, values), resulting in lower coverage and less effectiveness in fault detection. To address these limitations, we present AutoRestTest, the first black-box tool to adopt a dependency-embedded multi-agent approach for REST API testing that integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with a semantic property dependency graph (SPDG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach treats REST API testing as a separable problem, where four agents -- API, dependency, parameter, and value agents -- collaborate to optimize API exploration. LLMs handle domain-specific value generation, the SPDG model simplifies the search space for dependencies using a similarity score between API operations, and MARL dynamically optimizes the agents' behavior. Our evaluation of AutoRestTest on 12 real-world REST services shows that it outperforms the four leading black-box REST API testing tools, including those assisted by RESTGPT (which generates realistic test inputs using LLMs), in terms of code coverage, operation coverage, and fault detection. Notably, AutoRestTest is the only tool able to trigger an internal server error in the Spotify service. Our ablation study illustrates that each component of AutoRestTest -- the SPDG, the LLM, and the agent-learning mechanism -- contributes to its overall effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the 47th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Switching Rewards and History Dependency for Characterizing Animal Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12633v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional approaches to studying decision-making in neuroscience focus on simplified behavioral tasks where animals perform repetitive, stereotyped actions to receive explicit rewards. While informative, these methods constrain our understanding of decision-making to short timescale behaviors driven by explicit goals. In natural environments, animals exhibit more complex, long-term behaviors driven by intrinsic motivations that are often unobservable. Recent works in time-varying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aim to capture shifting motivations in long-term, freely moving behaviors. However, a crucial challenge remains: animals make decisions based on their history, not just their current state. To address this, we introduce SWIRL (SWitching IRL), a novel framework that extends traditional IRL by incorporating time-varying, history-dependent reward functions. SWIRL models long behavioral sequences as transitions between short-term decision-making processes, each governed by a unique reward function. SWIRL incorporates biologically plausible history dependency to capture how past decisions and environmental contexts shape behavior, offering a more accurate description of animal decision-making. We apply SWIRL to simulated and real-world animal behavior datasets and show that it outperforms models lacking history dependency, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This work presents the first IRL model to incorporate history-dependent policies and rewards to advance our understanding of complex, naturalistic decision-making in animals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy Efficient Transmission Parameters Selection Method Using Reinforcement Learning in Distributed LoRa Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11270v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increase in demand for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, the number of IoT devices has drastically grown, making spectrum resources seriously insufficient. Transmission collisions and retransmissions increase power consumption. Therefore, even in long-range (LoRa) networks, selecting appropriate transmission parameters, such as channel and transmission power, is essential to improve energy efficiency. However, due to the limited computational ability and memory, traditional transmission parameter selection methods for LoRa networks are challenging to implement on LoRa devices. To solve this problem, a distributed reinforcement learning-based channel and transmission power selection method is proposed, which can be implemented on the LoRa devices to improve energy efficiency in this paper. Specifically, the channel and transmission power selection problem in LoRa networks is first mapped to the multi-armed-bandit (MAB) problem. Then, an MAB-based method is introduced to solve the formulated transmission parameter selection problem based on the acknowledgment (ACK) packet and the power consumption for data transmission of the LoRa device. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by the constructed actual LoRa network. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than fixed assignment, adaptive data rate low-complexity (ADR-Lite), and $\epsilon$-greedy-based methods in terms of both transmission success rate and energy efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

While single intrinsic rewards, such as curiosity-driven or novelty-based methods, have shown effectiveness, they often limit the diversity and efficiency of exploration. Moreover, the potential and principle of combining multiple intrinsic rewards remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we introduce HIRE (Hybrid Intrinsic REward), a flexible and elegant framework for creating hybrid intrinsic rewards through deliberate fusion strategies. With HIRE, we conduct a systematic analysis of the application of hybrid intrinsic rewards in both general and unsupervised RL across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIRE can significantly enhance exploration efficiency and diversity, as well as skill acquisition in complex and dynamic settings.</p></details> | 18 pages, 14 figures |

Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%).</p></details> | 25 pages |

Additionally, multiple LoRa parameters for packet transmission must be dynamically configured to tailor the performance metrics prioritization across varying channel environments. Because of the coupling relationship between LoRa parameters and metrics, existing works have opted to focus on certain parameters or specific metrics to circumvent the intricate coupling relationship, leading to limited adaptability. Therefore, we propose D-LoRa, a distributed parameter adaptation scheme, based on reinforcement learning towards network performance. We decompose the joint performance optimization problem into multiple independent Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems with different reward functions. We have also built a comprehensive analytical model for the LoRa network that considers path loss, quasi-orthogonality of spreading factor, and packet collision. Experimental results show that our scheme can increase packet delivery rate by up to 28.8% and demonstrates superior adaptability across different performance metrics.</p></details> |  |

This system is made possible by 1) a hierarchical design of a high-level policy for visual-mobile manipulation following instructions and a low-level policy for quadruped movement and limb control, 2) a progressive exploration and learning approach that leverages privileged task decomposition information to train the teacher policy for long-horizon tasks, which will guide an imitation-based student policy for efficient training of the high-level visuomotor policy, and 3) a suite of techniques for minimizing sim-to-real gaps. In contrast to previous approaches that use high-end equipment, our system demonstrates effective performance with more accessible hardware - specifically, a Unitree Go1 quadruped, a WidowX250S arm, and a single wrist-mounted RGB camera - despite the increased challenges of sim-to-real transfer. When fully trained in simulation, a single policy autonomously solves long-horizon tasks such as search, move, grasp, and drop-into, achieving nearly 80% success. This performance is comparable to that of expert human teleoperation on the same tasks but operates in a more efficient way, at 1.5 times the speed of human expert. The sim-to-real transfer is fluid across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes under varying lighting conditions. Finally, we discuss the key techniques that enable the entire pipeline, including efficient RL training and sim-to-real, to work effectively for legged mobile manipulation, and present their ablation results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Diversity-based Experience Replay for Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20487v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Experience replay is widely used to improve learning efficiency in reinforcement learning by leveraging past experiences. However, existing experience replay methods, whether based on uniform or prioritized sampling, often suffer from low efficiency, particularly in real-world scenarios with high-dimensional state spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach, Efficient Diversity-based Experience Replay (EDER). EDER employs a deterministic point process to model the diversity between samples and prioritizes replay based on the diversity between samples. To further enhance learning efficiency, we incorporate Cholesky decomposition for handling large state spaces in realistic environments. Additionally, rejection sampling is applied to select samples with higher diversity, thereby improving overall learning efficacy. Extensive experiments are conducted on robotic manipulation tasks in MuJoCo, Atari games, and realistic indoor environments in Habitat. The results demonstrate that our approach not only significantly improves learning efficiency but also achieves superior performance in high-dimensional, realistic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Constrained Beam Search for Parameter Optimization of Paper Drying Under Flexible Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12542v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches to enforcing design constraints in Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications often rely on training-time penalties in the reward function or training/inference-time invalid action masking, but these methods either cannot be modified after training, or are limited in the types of constraints that can be implemented. To address this limitation, we propose Reinforcement Learning Constrained Beam Search (RLCBS) for inference-time refinement in combinatorial optimization problems. This method respects flexible, inference-time constraints that support exclusion of invalid actions and forced inclusion of desired actions, and employs beam search to maximize sequence probability for more sensible constraint incorporation. RLCBS is extensible to RL-based planning and optimization problems that do not require real-time solution, and we apply the method to optimize process parameters for a novel modular testbed for paper drying. An RL agent is trained to minimize energy consumption across varying machine speed levels by generating optimal dryer module and air supply temperature configurations. Our results demonstrate that RLCBS outperforms NSGA-II under complex design constraints on drying module configurations at inference-time, while providing a 2.58-fold or higher speed improvement.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce a novel method: the compositionally-enabled reinforcement learning language agent (CERLLA). Our method reduces the sample complexity of tasks specified with language by leveraging compositional policy representations and a semantic parser trained using reinforcement learning and in-context learning. We evaluate our approach in an environment requiring function approximation and demonstrate compositional generalization to novel tasks. Our method significantly outperforms the previous best non-compositional baseline in terms of sample complexity on 162 tasks designed to test compositional generalization. Our model attains a higher success rate and learns in fewer steps than the non-compositional baseline. It reaches a success rate equal to an oracle policy's upper-bound performance of 92%. With the same number of environment steps, the baseline only reaches a success rate of 80%.</p></details> | TMLR 2024 |
| **[Social Interpretable Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15480v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) bears the promise of being a game-changer in many applications. However, since most of the literature in the field is currently focused on opaque models, the use of RL in high-stakes scenarios, where interpretability is crucial, is still limited. Recently, some approaches to interpretable RL, e.g., based on Decision Trees, have been proposed, but one of the main limitations of these techniques is their training cost. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new method, called Social Interpretable RL (SIRL), that can substantially reduce the number of episodes needed for training. Our method mimics a social learning process, where each agent in a group learns to solve a given task based both on its own individual experience as well as the experience acquired together with its peers. Our approach is divided into the following two phases. (1) In the collaborative phase, all the agents in the population interact with a shared instance of the environment, where each agent observes the state and independently proposes an action. Then, voting is performed to choose the action that will actually be deployed in the environment. (2) In the individual phase, then, each agent refines its individual performance by interacting with its own instance of the environment. This mechanism makes the agents experience a larger number of episodes with little impact on the computational cost of the process. Our results (on 6 widely-known RL benchmarks) show that SIRL not only reduces the computational cost by a factor varying from a minimum of 43% to a maximum 76%, but it also increases the convergence speed and, often, improves the quality of the solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 25 figures, accepted at evo*2025</p></details> |

While reward models (RMs) with reinforcement learning or test-time scaling offer the potential for improving generation quality, a critical gap remains: publicly available multi-modal RMs for LVLMs are scarce, and the implementation details of proprietary models are often unclear. We bridge this gap with InternLM-XComposer2.5-Reward (IXC-2.5-Reward), a simple yet effective multi-modal reward model that aligns LVLMs with human preferences. To ensure the robustness and versatility of IXC-2.5-Reward, we set up a high-quality multi-modal preference corpus spanning text, image, and video inputs across diverse domains, such as instruction following, general understanding, text-rich documents, mathematical reasoning, and video understanding. IXC-2.5-Reward achieves excellent results on the latest multi-modal reward model benchmark and shows competitive performance on text-only reward model benchmarks. We further demonstrate three key applications of IXC-2.5-Reward: (1) Providing a supervisory signal for RL training. We integrate IXC-2.5-Reward with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) yields IXC-2.5-Chat, which shows consistent improvements in instruction following and multi-modal open-ended dialogue; (2) Selecting the best response from candidate responses for test-time scaling; and (3) Filtering outlier or noisy samples from existing image and video instruction tuning training data.

Cyber-physical threats are becoming increasingly prevalent, as digital systems are ubiquitous in critical infrastructure. The challenge with determining the resilience of cyber-physical systems is identifying a set of resilience metrics that can adapt to the changing states of the system. A static resilience metric can lead to an inaccurate estimation of system state, and can result in unintended consequences against cyber threats. In this work, we propose a data-driven method for adaptive resilience metric learning. The primary goal is to learn a single resilience metric by formulating an inverse reinforcement learning problem that learns a reward or objective from a set of control actions from an expert. It learns the structure or parameters of the reward function based on information provided by expert demonstrations. Most prior work has considered static weights or theories from fuzzy logic to formulate a single resilience metric. Instead, this work learns the resilience metric, represented as reward function, using adversarial inverse reinforcement learning, to determine the optimal policy through training the generator discriminator in parallel. We evaluate our proposed technique in scenarios such as optimal communication network rerouting, power distribution network reconfiguration, and a combined cyber-physical restoration of critical load using the IEEE 123-bus system.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Behind the Myth of Exploration in Policy Gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00162v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy-gradient algorithms are effective reinforcement learning methods for solving control problems. To compute near-optimal policies, it is essential in practice to include exploration terms in the learning objective. Although the effectiveness of these terms is usually justified by an intrinsic need to explore environments, we propose a novel analysis with the lens of numerical optimization. Two criteria are introduced on the learning objective and two others on its stochastic gradient estimates, and are afterwards used to discuss the quality of the policy after optimization. The analysis sheds the light on two separate effects of exploration techniques. First, they make it possible to smooth the learning objective and to eliminate local optima while preserving the global maximum. Second, they modify the gradient estimates, increasing the probability that the stochastic parameter updates eventually provide an optimal policy. These effects are illustrated empirically on exploration strategies based on entropy bonuses, highlighting their limitations and opening avenues for future works in the design and analysis of such strategies.</p></details> |  |

In many modern applications such as autonomous driving, an overwhelming majority of videos serve as input for AI systems performing tasks like object recognition or segmentation, rather than being watched by humans. It is therefore useful to optimize the encoder for a downstream task instead of for perceptual image quality. However, a major challenge is how to combine such downstream optimization with existing standard video encoders, which are highly efficient and popular. Here, we address this challenge by controlling the Quantization Parameters (QPs) at the macro-block level to optimize the downstream task. This granular control allows us to prioritize encoding for task-relevant regions within each frame. We formulate this optimization problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) task, where the agent learns to balance long-term implications of choosing QPs on both task performance and bit-rate constraints. Notably, our policy does not require the downstream task as an input during inference, making it suitable for streaming applications and edge devices such as vehicles. We demonstrate significant improvements in two tasks, car detection, and ROI (saliency) encoding. Our approach improves task performance for a given bit rate compared to traditional task agnostic encoding methods, paving the way for more efficient task-aware video compression.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Search-to-Control Reinforcement Learning Based Framework for Quadrotor Local Planning in Dense Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00275v3)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agile flight in complex environments poses significant challenges to current motion planning methods, as they often fail to fully leverage the quadrotor's dynamic potential, leading to performance failures and reduced efficiency during aggressive maneuvers. Existing approaches frequently decouple trajectory optimization from control generation and neglect the dynamics, further limiting their ability to generate aggressive and feasible motions. To address these challenges, we introduce an enhanced Search-to-Control planning framework that integrates visibility path searching with reinforcement learning (RL) control generation, directly accounting for dynamics and bridging the gap between planning and control. Our method first extracts control points from collision-free paths using a proposed heuristic search, which are then refined by an RL policy to generate low-level control commands for the quadrotor's controller, utilizing reduced-dimensional obstacle observations for efficient inference with lightweight neural networks. We validate the framework through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved time efficiency and dynamic maneuverability compared to existing methods, while confirming its robustness and applicability. To support further research, We will release our implementation as an open-source package.</p></details> |  |
| **[Experience-replay Innovative Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12199v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite its groundbreaking success, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) still suffers from instability and nonstationarity. Replicator dynamics, the most well-known model from evolutionary game theory (EGT), provide a theoretical framework for the convergence of the trajectories to Nash equilibria and, as a result, have been used to ensure formal guarantees for MARL algorithms in stable game settings. However, they exhibit the opposite behavior in other settings, which poses the problem of finding alternatives to ensure convergence. In contrast, innovative dynamics, such as the Brown-von Neumann-Nash (BNN) or Smith, result in periodic trajectories with the potential to approximate Nash equilibria. Yet, no MARL algorithms based on these dynamics have been proposed. In response to this challenge, we develop a novel experience replay-based MARL algorithm that incorporates revision protocols as tunable hyperparameters. We demonstrate, by appropriately adjusting the revision protocols, that the behavior of our algorithm mirrors the trajectories resulting from these dynamics. Importantly, our contribution provides a framework capable of extending the theoretical guarantees of MARL algorithms beyond replicator dynamics. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with empirical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback without Reward Inference: Model-Free Algorithm and Instance-Dependent Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07455v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) under an episodic Markov decision process with a general trajectory-wise reward model. We developed a model-free RLHF best policy identification algorithm, called $\mathsf{BSAD}$, without explicit reward model inference, which is a critical intermediate step in the contemporary RLHF paradigms for training large language models (LLM). The algorithm identifies the optimal policy directly from human preference information in a backward manner, employing a dueling bandit sub-routine that constantly duels actions to identify the superior one. $\mathsf{BSAD}$ adopts a reward-free exploration and best-arm-identification-like adaptive stopping criteria to equalize the visitation among all states in the same decision step while moving to the previous step as soon as the optimal action is identifiable, leading to a provable, instance-dependent sample complexity $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(c_{\mathcal{M}}SA^3H^3M\log\frac{1}{\delta})$ which resembles the result in classic RL, where $c_{\mathcal{M}}$ is the instance-dependent constant and $M$ is the batch size. Moreover, $\mathsf{BSAD}$ can be transformed into an explore-then-commit algorithm with logarithmic regret and generalized to discounted MDPs using a frame-based approach. Our results show: (i) sample-complexity-wise, RLHF is not significantly harder than classic RL and (ii) end-to-end RLHF may deliver improved performance by avoiding pitfalls in reward inferring such as overfit and distribution shift.</p></details> |  |

However, popular adversarial policies are apt for fixed tokenization, hindering its efficacy for common character perturbations involving versatile tokenization. Based on existing adversarial generation via reinforcement learning~(RL), we propose the `DexChar policy' that introduces character perturbations for the existing mainstream adversarial policy based on token substitution. Furthermore, we improve the self-supervised matching that provides feedback in RL to cater to the semantic constraints required during training adversaries. Experiments show that our method is compatible with the scenario where baseline adversaries fail, and can generate high-efficiency adversarial examples for analysis and optimization of the system.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CCMT 2024()</p></details> |

However, DNR heavily relies on datasets composed of numerous ray-traced images and demands substantial computational resources. It remains under-explored how to reduce the reliance on high-quality ray-traced images while maintaining the rendering fidelity. In this paper, we propose DNRSelect, which integrates a reinforcement learning-based view selector and a 3D texture aggregator for deferred neural rendering. We first propose a novel view selector for deferred neural rendering based on reinforcement learning, which is trained on easily obtained rasterized images to identify the optimal views. By acquiring only a few ray-traced images for these selected views, the selector enables DNR to achieve high-quality rendering. To further enhance spatial awareness and geometric consistency in DNR, we introduce a 3D texture aggregator that fuses pyramid features from depth maps and normal maps with UV maps. Given that acquiring ray-traced images is more time-consuming than generating rasterized images, DNRSelect minimizes the need for ray-traced data by using only a few selected views while still achieving high-fidelity rendering results. We conduct detailed experiments and ablation studies on the NeRF-Synthetic dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of DNRSelect. The code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Despite progress in existing methods, the inherent modality heterogeneity limits the effective capture of interactive sentiment features across modalities. In this paper, by introducing a Multi-Modality Collaborative Learning (MMCL) framework, we facilitate cross-modal interactions and capture enhanced and complementary features from modality-common and modality-specific representations, respectively. Specifically, we design a parameter-free decoupling module and separate uni-modality into modality-common and modality-specific components through semantics assessment of cross-modal elements. For modality-specific representations, inspired by the act-reward mechanism in reinforcement learning, we design policy models to adaptively mine complementary sentiment features under the guidance of a joint reward. For modality-common representations, intra-modal attention is employed to highlight crucial components, playing enhanced roles among modalities. Experimental results, including superiority evaluations on four databases, effectiveness verification of each module, and assessment of complementary features, demonstrate that MMCL successfully learns collaborative features across modalities and significantly improves performance.

| **[Tackling Uncertainties in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning through Integration of Agent Termination Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12061v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has gained significant traction for solving complex real-world tasks, but the inherent stochasticity and uncertainty in these environments pose substantial challenges to efficient and robust policy learning. While Distributional Reinforcement Learning has been successfully applied in single-agent settings to address risk and uncertainty, its application in MARL is substantially limited. In this work, we propose a novel approach that integrates distributional learning with a safety-focused loss function to improve convergence in cooperative MARL tasks. Specifically, we introduce a Barrier Function based loss that leverages safety metrics, identified from inherent faults in the system, into the policy learning process. This additional loss term helps mitigate risks and encourages safer exploration during the early stages of training. We evaluate our method in the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark, where our approach demonstrates improved convergence and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both safety and task completion. Our results suggest that incorporating safety considerations can significantly enhance learning performance in complex, multi-agent environments.</p></details> |  |

These environments, originally with finite tasks, are expanded into innovative, endless formats, mirroring the escalating challenges of cumulative memory games such as "I packed my bag". This progression in task design shifts the focus from merely assessing sample efficiency to also probing the levels of memory effectiveness in dynamic, prolonged scenarios. To address the gap in available memory-based Deep Reinforcement Learning baselines, we introduce an implementation within the open-source CleanRL library that integrates Transformer-XL (TrXL) with Proximal Policy Optimization. This approach utilizes TrXL as a form of episodic memory, employing a sliding window technique. Our comparative study between the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and TrXL reveals varied performances across our finite and endless tasks. TrXL, on the finite environments, demonstrates superior effectiveness over GRU, but only when utilizing an auxiliary loss to reconstruct observations. Notably, GRU makes a remarkable resurgence in all endless tasks, consistently outperforming TrXL by significant margins.

Many methods directly use known state sequences for reasoning. However, this approach fails to enhance the quality of reasoning by capturing the subtle variation between states. Much like how humans infer trends in event development from this variation, in this work, we introduce Global-Local variation Awareness Mamba-based world model (GLAM) that improves reasoning quality by perceiving and predicting variation between states. GLAM comprises two Mambabased parallel reasoning modules, GMamba and LMamba, which focus on perceiving variation from global and local perspectives, respectively, during the reasoning process. GMamba focuses on identifying patterns of variation between states in the input sequence and leverages these patterns to enhance the prediction of future state variation. LMamba emphasizes reasoning about unknown information, such as rewards, termination signals, and visual representations, by perceiving variation in adjacent states. By integrating the strengths of the two modules, GLAM accounts for highervalue variation in environmental changes, providing the agent with more efficient imagination-based training. We demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in normalized human scores on the Atari 100k benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Hop for a Single-Legged Robot with Parallel Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11945v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents the application of reinforcement learning to improve the performance of a highly dynamic hopping system with a parallel mechanism. Unlike serial mechanisms, parallel mechanisms can not be accurately simulated due to the complexity of their kinematic constraints and closed-loop structures. Besides, learning to hop suffers from prolonged aerial phase and the sparse nature of the rewards. To address them, we propose a learning framework to encode long-history feedback to account for the under-actuation brought by the prolonged aerial phase. In the proposed framework, we also introduce a simplified serial configuration for the parallel design to avoid directly simulating parallel structure during the training. A torque-level conversion is designed to deal with the parallel-serial conversion to handle the sim-to-real issue. Simulation and hardware experiments have been conducted to validate this framework.</p></details> |  |

Different flight missions may have varying objectives, such as minimizing energy consumption, achieving precise positioning, or maximizing speed. A controller that can adapt to different objectives on the fly is highly valuable. Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers are one of the most popular and widely used control algorithms for drones and other control systems, but their linear control algorithm fails to capture the nonlinear nature of the dynamic wind conditions and complex drone system. Manually tuning the PID gains for various missions can be time-consuming and requires significant expertise. This paper aims to revolutionize drone flight control by presenting the AirPilot, a nonlinear Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - enhanced Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) drone controller using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). AirPilot controller combines the simplicity and effectiveness of traditional PID control with the adaptability, learning capability, and optimization potential of DRL. This makes it better suited for modern drone applications where the environment is dynamic, and mission-specific performance demands are high. We employed a COEX Clover autonomous drone for training the DRL agent within the simulator and implemented it in a real-world lab setting, which marks a significant milestone as one of the first attempts to apply a DRL-based flight controller on an actual drone. Airpilot is capable of reducing the navigation error of the default PX4 PID position controller by 90%, improving effective navigation speed of a fine-tuned PID controller by 21%, reducing settling time and overshoot by 17% and 16% respectively.</p></details> | 9 pages, 20 figures |
| **[Contrastive Representation for Interactive Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18396v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive Recommendation (IR) has gained significant attention recently for its capability to quickly capture dynamic interest and optimize both short and long term objectives. IR agents are typically implemented through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), because DRL is inherently compatible with the dynamic nature of IR. However, DRL is currently not perfect for IR. Due to the large action space and sample inefficiency problem, training DRL recommender agents is challenging. The key point is that useful features cannot be extracted as high-quality representations for the recommender agent to optimize its policy. To tackle this problem, we propose Contrastive Representation for Interactive Recommendation (CRIR). CRIR efficiently extracts latent, high-level preference ranking features from explicit interaction, and leverages the features to enhance users' representation. Specifically, the CRIR provides representation through one representation network, and refines it through our proposed Preference Ranking Contrastive Learning (PRCL). The key insight of PRCL is that it can perform contrastive learning without relying on computations involving high-level representations or large potential action sets. Furthermore, we also propose a data exploiting mechanism and an agent training mechanism to better adapt CRIR to the DRL backbone. Extensive experiments have been carried out to show our method's superior improvement on the sample efficiency while training an DRL-based IR agent.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI-...</summary><p>AAAI-2025 Accepted paper</p></details> |

The goal is to improve the learning performance of each individual agent. Under a more general heterogeneous setting where different agents learn using different algorithms, we advance GARL by designing novel and effective group-learning mechanisms. They guide the agents on whether and how to learn from action choices from the others, and allow the agents to adopt available policy and value function models sent by another agent if they perform better. We have conducted extensive experiments on a total of 43 different Atari 2600 games to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. After the group learning, among the 129 agents examined, 96% are able to achieve a learning speed-up, and 72% are able to learn over 100 times faster. Also, around 41% of those agents have achieved a higher accumulated reward score by learning in less than 5% of the time steps required by a single agent when learning on its own.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategy Masking: A Method for Guardrails in Value-based Reinforcement Learning Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05501v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of reward functions to structure AI learning and decision making is core to the current reinforcement learning paradigm; however, without careful design of reward functions, agents can learn to solve problems in ways that may be considered "undesirable" or "unethical." Without thorough understanding of the incentives a reward function creates, it can be difficult to impose principled yet general control mechanisms over its behavior. In this paper, we study methods for constructing guardrails for AI agents that use reward functions to learn decision making. We introduce a novel approach, which we call strategy masking, to explicitly learn and then suppress undesirable AI agent behavior. We apply our method to study lying in AI agents and show that it can be used to effectively modify agent behavior by suppressing lying post-training without compromising agent ability to perform effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Agents using Social Choice Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03121v3)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that many general evaluation problems can be viewed through the lens of voting theory. Each task is interpreted as a separate voter, which requires only ordinal rankings or pairwise comparisons of agents to produce an overall evaluation. By viewing the aggregator as a social welfare function, we are able to leverage centuries of research in social choice theory to derive principled evaluation frameworks with axiomatic foundations. These evaluations are interpretable and flexible, while avoiding many of the problems currently facing cross-task evaluation. We apply this Voting-as-Evaluation (VasE) framework across multiple settings, including reinforcement learning, large language models, and humans. In practice, we observe that VasE can be more robust than popular evaluation frameworks (Elo and Nash averaging), discovers properties in the evaluation data not evident from scores alone, and can predict outcomes better than Elo in a complex seven-player game. We identify one particular approach, maximal lotteries, that satisfies important consistency properties relevant to evaluation, is computationally efficient (polynomial in the size of the evaluation data), and identifies game-theoretic cycles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Language Model Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning and Inference Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11651v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches mainly rely on imitation learning and struggle to achieve effective test-time scaling. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for enabling self-exploration and learning from feedback, recent attempts yield only modest improvements in complex reasoning. In this paper, we present T1 to scale RL by encouraging exploration and understand inference scaling. We first initialize the LLM using synthesized chain-of-thought data that integrates trial-and-error and self-verification. To scale RL training, we promote increased sampling diversity through oversampling. We further employ an entropy bonus as an auxiliary loss, alongside a dynamic anchor for regularization to facilitate reward optimization. We demonstrate that T1 with open LLMs as its base exhibits inference scaling behavior and achieves superior performance on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. For example, T1 with Qwen2.5-32B as the base model outperforms the recent Qwen QwQ-32B-Preview model on MATH500, AIME2024, and Omni-math-500. More importantly, we present a simple strategy to examine inference scaling, where increased inference budgets directly lead to T1's better performance without any additional verification. We will open-source the T1 models and the data used to train them at \url{https://github.com/THUDM/T1}.</p></details> |  |

Accordingly, a key challenge in these networks is managing channel access amidst jammers and under dynamic channel conditions. In this context, we propose a robust learning-based mechanism for channel access in multi-cell quasi-static networks under jamming. The network comprises multiple legitimate UEs, including predefined UEs (pUEs) with stochastic predefined schedules and an intelligent UE (iUE) with an undefined transmission schedule, all transmitting over a shared, time-varying uplink channel. Jammers transmit unwanted packets to disturb the pUEs' and the iUE's communication. The iUE's learning process is based on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, utilizing a residual network (ResNet)-based deep Q-Network (DQN). To coexist in the network and maximize the network's sum cross-layer achievable rate (SCLAR), the iUE must learn the unknown network dynamics while concurrently adapting to dynamic channel conditions. Our simulation results reveal that, with properly defined state space, action space, and rewards in DRL, the iUE can effectively coexist in the network, maximizing channel utilization and the network's SCLAR by judiciously selecting transmission time slots and thus avoiding collisions and jamming.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, a unified framework has been proposed for allocating in-band resource blocks (RBs), i.e., within a multi-cell network, to 5G-NR users in co-existence with NB-IoT and LTE-M devices. First, a benchmark (upper-bound) scheduler has been designed for joint sub-carrier (SC) and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) allocation that maximizes instantaneous throughput and fairness among users/devices, while considering synchronous RB allocation in the neighboring cells. A series of numerical simulations with realistic ICI in an urban scenario have been used to compute benchmark upper-bound solutions for characterizing performance in terms of throughput, fairness, and delay. Next, an edge learning based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework has been developed for different DRL algorithms, specifically, a policy-based gradient network (PGN), a deep Q-learning based network (DQN), and an actor-critic based deep deterministic policy gradient network (DDPGN). The proposed DRL framework depends on interference allocation, where the actions are based on inter-cell-interference (ICI) instead of power, which can bypass the need for raw data sharing and/or inter-agent communication. The numerical results reveal that the interference allocation based DRL schedulers can significantly outperform their counterparts, where the actions are based on power allocation. Further, the performance of the proposed policy-based edge learning algorithms is close to the centralized ones.</p></details> |  |

Efficient and secure resource allocation in serverless multi-cloud edge computing environments is essential for supporting these demands and advancing distributed computing. However, existing solutions frequently struggle with the complexity of multi-cloud infrastructures, robust security integration, and effective application of traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques under system constraints. To address these challenges, we present SARMTO, a novel framework that integrates an action-constrained DRL model. SARMTO dynamically balances resource allocation, task offloading, security, and performance by utilizing a Markov decision process formulation, an adaptive security mechanism, and sophisticated optimization techniques. Extensive simulations across varying scenarios, including different task loads, data sizes, and MEC capacities, show that SARMTO consistently outperforms five baseline approaches, achieving up to a 40% reduction in system costs and a 41.5% improvement in energy efficiency over state-of-the-art methods. These enhancements highlight SARMTO's potential to revolutionize resource management in intricate distributed computing environments, opening the door to more efficient and secure IoT and edge computing applications.</p></details> |  |

To ensure consistent code quality while still allowing fast development cycles, Continuous Integration (CI) is commonly applied. However, operating CI at such scale not only leads to a single point of failure for many developers, but also requires computational resources that may reach feasibility limits and cause long feedback latencies. To address these issues, developers commonly split test executions across multiple pipelines, running small and fast tests in pre-submit stages while executing long-running and flaky tests in post-submit pipelines. Given the long runtimes of many pipelines and the substantial proportion of passing test executions (98% in our pre-submit pipelines), there not only a need but also potential for further improvements by prioritizing and selecting tests. However, many previously proposed regression optimization techniques are unfit for an industrial context, because they (1) rely on complex and difficult-to-obtain features like per-test code coverage that are not feasible in large, multi-language environments, (2) do not automatically adapt to rapidly changing systems where new tests are continuously added or modified, and (3) are not designed to distinguish the different objectives of pre- and post-submit pipelines: While pre-submit testing should prioritize failing tests, post-submit pipelines should prioritize tests that indicate non-flaky changes by transitioning from pass to fail outcomes or vice versa. To overcome these issues, we developed a lightweight and pipeline-aware regression test optimization approach that employs Reinforcement Learning models trained on language-agnostic features. We evaluated our approach on a large industry dataset collected over a span of 20 weeks of CI test executions.

| **[The impact of intrinsic rewards on exploration in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11533v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the open challenges in Reinforcement Learning is the hard exploration problem in sparse reward environments. Various types of intrinsic rewards have been proposed to address this challenge by pushing towards diversity. This diversity might be imposed at different levels, favouring the agent to explore different states, policies or behaviours (State, Policy and Skill level diversity, respectively). However, the impact of diversity on the agent's behaviour remains unclear. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by studying the effect of different levels of diversity imposed by intrinsic rewards on the exploration patterns of RL agents. We select four intrinsic rewards (State Count, Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), Maximum Entropy, and Diversity is all you need (DIAYN)), each pushing for a different diversity level. We conduct an empirical study on MiniGrid environment to compare their impact on exploration considering various metrics related to the agent's exploration, namely: episodic return, observation coverage, agent's position coverage, policy entropy, and timeframes to reach the sparse reward. The main outcome of the study is that State Count leads to the best exploration performance in the case of low-dimensional observations. However, in the case of RGB observations, the performance of State Count is highly degraded mostly due to representation learning challenges. Conversely, Maximum Entropy is less impacted, resulting in a more robust exploration, despite being not always optimal. Lastly, our empirical study revealed that learning diverse skills with DIAYN, often linked to improved robustness and generalisation, does not promote exploration in MiniGrid environments. This is because: i) learning the skill space itself can be challenging, and ii) exploration within the skill space prioritises differentiating between behaviours rather than achieving uniform state visitation.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 17 figures.

The IoT faces several challenges, including energy efficiency and scalability, that require consideration of enabling technologies such as network softwarization. This technology is an appropriate solution for IoT, leveraging Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) as two main techniques, especially when combined with Machine Learning (ML). Although many efforts have been made to optimize routing in softwarized IoT, the existing solutions do not take advantage of distributed intelligence. In this paper, we propose to optimize routing in softwarized IoT networks using Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL), where distributed network softwarization and intelligence (i.e., FDRL) join forces to improve routing in constrained IoT networks. Our proposal introduces the combination of two novelties (i.e., distributed controller design and intelligent routing) to meet the IoT requirements (mainly performance and energy efficiency). The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposal compared to the conventional counterparts.</p></details> |  |

This trade-off between diversity and alignment quality remains a significant challenge. Drawing inspiration from curiosity-driven exploration in reinforcement learning, we introduce curiosity-driven RLHF (CD-RLHF), a framework that incorporates intrinsic rewards for novel states, alongside traditional sparse extrinsic rewards, to optimize both output diversity and alignment quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CD-RLHF through extensive experiments on a range of tasks, including text summarization and instruction following. Our approach achieves significant gains in diversity on multiple diversity-oriented metrics while maintaining alignment with human preferences comparable to standard RLHF.

However, variationally preparing thermal states on near-term quantum processors for large systems (N>12, where N is the number of Majorana fermions) presents a significant challenge due to the rapid growth in the complexity of parameterized quantum circuits. This paper addresses this challenge by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with convolutional neural networks, employing an iterative approach to optimize the quantum circuit and its parameters. The refinement process is guided by a composite reward signal derived from entropy and the expectation values of the SYK Hamiltonian. This approach reduces the number of CNOT gates by two orders of magnitude for systems N>10 compared to traditional methods like first-order Trotterization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL framework in both noiseless and noisy quantum hardware environments, maintaining high accuracy in thermal state preparation. This work contributes to the advancement of a scalable, RL-based framework with applications for computations of thermal out-of-time-order correlators in quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity studies on near-term quantum hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and the data will be available soon.

Leveraging reinforcement learning principles, the framework integrates custom reward functions and dynamic context alignment mechanisms to address challenges inherent in maintaining long-range dependencies across extended sequences. The architecture incorporates multi-head attention layers and hierarchical encoding modules, enabling the model to produce outputs that align closely with human expectations of logical structure and semantic flow. Quantitative evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in coherence metrics, perplexity reduction, and semantic alignment, showcasing the framework's ability to outperform baseline models in both general and domain-specific tasks. Qualitative analyses further highlight the framework's capacity to generate text with improved narrative clarity and reduced redundancy, reflecting its effectiveness in balancing fluency with structural precision. In addition to its performance gains, the framework exhibits robustness in handling noisy input data and scalability across varying model sizes, reinforcing its versatility in practical applications. Experimental results reveal that optimal context window sizes significantly influence coherence outcomes, showing the importance of architectural flexibility in adapting to diverse linguistic structures. Cross-lingual performance evaluations affirm the framework's adaptability to multiple languages, extending its utility beyond monolingual contexts. Resource efficiency analyses indicate a reduction in computational overhead compared to traditional approaches, emphasizing the practicality of the framework for large-scale deployment.</p></details> |  |

In this context, serverless functions are emerging as a lightweight and effective paradigm for managing computational tasks on edge infrastructures. However, the placement of such functions in constrained edge nodes remains an open challenge. On one hand, it is key to minimize network delays and optimize resource consumption; on the other hand, decisions must be made in a timely manner due to the highly dynamic nature of edge environments. In this paper, we propose POSEIDON, a solution based on Deep Reinforcement Learning for the efficient placement of functions at the edge. POSEIDON leverages Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to place functions across a distributed network of nodes under highly dynamic workloads. A comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that POSEIDON significantly reduces execution time, network delay, and resource consumption compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted at ICSOC'24 (International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing)</p></details> |
| **[DutyTTE: Deciphering Uncertainty in Origin-Destination Travel Time Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12809v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification in travel time estimation (TTE) aims to estimate the confidence interval for travel time, given the origin (O), destination (D), and departure time (T). Accurately quantifying this uncertainty requires generating the most likely path and assessing travel time uncertainty along the path. This involves two main challenges: 1) Predicting a path that aligns with the ground truth, and 2) modeling the impact of travel time in each segment on overall uncertainty under varying conditions. We propose DutyTTE to address these challenges. For the first challenge, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning method to improve alignment between the predicted path and the ground truth, providing more accurate travel time information from road segments to improve TTE. For the second challenge, we propose a mixture of experts guided uncertainty quantification mechanism to better capture travel time uncertainty for each segment under varying contexts. Additionally, we calibrate our results using Hoeffding's upper-confidence bound to provide statistical guarantees for the estimated confidence intervals. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[The "Law" of the Unconscious Contrastive Learner: Probabilistic Alignment of Unpaired Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11326v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While internet-scale data often comes in pairs (e.g., audio/image, image/text), we often want to perform inferences over modalities unseen together in the training data (e.g., audio/text). Empirically, this can often be addressed by learning multiple contrastive embedding spaces between existing modality pairs, implicitly hoping that unseen modality pairs will end up being aligned. This theoretical paper proves that this hope is well founded, under certain assumptions. Starting with the proper Bayesian approach of integrating out intermediate modalities, we show that directly comparing the representations of data from unpaired modalities can recover the same likelihood ratio. Our analysis builds on prior work on the geometry and probabilistic interpretation of contrastive representations, showing how these representations can answer many of the same inferences as probabilistic graphical models. Our analysis suggests two new ways of using contrastive representations: in settings with pre-trained contrastive models, and for handling language ambiguity in reinforcement learning. Our numerical experiments study the importance of our assumptions and demonstrate these new applications.</p></details> |  |

Measurement-based-feedback strategies have demonstrated powerful performance, and the construction of quantum control signals using measurement information has attracted great interest. However, the interaction between quantum systems and the environment is inevitable, especially when measurements are introduced, which leads to decoherence. To mitigate decoherence, it is desirable to stabilize quantum systems faster, thereby reducing the time of interaction with the environment. In this paper, we utilize information obtained from measurement and apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, without explicitly constructing specific complex measurement-control mappings, to rapidly drive random initial quantum state to the target state. The proposed DRL algorithm has the ability to speed up the convergence to a target state, which shortens the interaction between quantum systems and their environments to protect coherence. Simulations are performed on two-qubit and three-qubit systems, and the results show that our algorithm can successfully stabilize random initial quantum system to the target entangled state, with a convergence time faster than traditional methods such as Lyapunov feedback control and several DRL algorithms with different reward functions. Moreover, it exhibits robustness against imperfect measurements and delays in system evolution.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore the untapped potential of scaling Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) data to 1000k samples, pioneering the development of a slow-thinking model, RedStar. Through extensive experiments with various LLMs and different sizes, we uncover the ingredients for specialization and scale for Long-CoT training. Surprisingly, even smaller models show significant performance gains with limited data, revealing the sample efficiency of Long-CoT and the critical role of sample difficulty in the learning process. Our findings demonstrate that Long-CoT reasoning can be effectively triggered with just a few thousand examples, while larger models achieve unparalleled improvements. We also introduce reinforcement learning (RL)-scale training as a promising direction for advancing slow-thinking systems. RedStar shines across domains: on the MATH-Hard benchmark, RedStar-code-math boosts performance from 66.2\% to 81.6\%, and on the USA Math Olympiad (AIME), it solves 46.7\% of problems using only 21k mixed-code-math datasets. In multimodal tasks like GeoQA and MathVista-GEO, RedStar-Geo achieves competitive results with minimal Long-CoT data, outperforming other slow-thinking systems like QvQ-Preview. Compared to QwQ, RedStar strikes the perfect balance between reasoning and generalizability. Our work highlights that, with careful tuning, scaling Long-CoT can unlock extraordinary reasoning capabilities-even with limited dataset and set a new standard for slow-thinking models across diverse challenges.

| **[A Survey on Uncertainty Quantification Methods for Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13425v6)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in making accurate predictions for computer vision, natural language processing, as well as science and engineering domains. However, it is also well-recognized that DNNs sometimes make unexpected, incorrect, but overconfident predictions. This can cause serious consequences in high-stake applications, such as autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and disaster response. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) aims to estimate the confidence of DNN predictions beyond prediction accuracy. In recent years, many UQ methods have been developed for DNNs. It is of great practical value to systematically categorize these UQ methods and compare their advantages and disadvantages. However, existing surveys mostly focus on categorizing UQ methodologies from a neural network architecture perspective or a Bayesian perspective and ignore the source of uncertainty that each methodology can incorporate, making it difficult to select an appropriate UQ method in practice. To fill the gap, this paper presents a systematic taxonomy of UQ methods for DNNs based on the types of uncertainty sources (data uncertainty versus model uncertainty). We summarize the advantages and disadvantages of methods in each category. We show how our taxonomy of UQ methodologies can potentially help guide the choice of UQ method in different machine learning problems (e.g., active learning, robustness, and reinforcement learning). We also identify current research gaps and propose several future research directions.</p></details> | 39 pages, 13 figures |

These devices support industries such as agriculture, forestry, and resource extraction. Due to the device location being in remote areas, satellites are frequently used to collect and deliver IoT device data to customers. As these devices become increasingly advanced and numerous, the amount of data produced has rapidly increased potentially straining the ability for radio frequency (RF) downlink capacity. Free space optical communications with their wide available bandwidths and high data rates are a potential solution, but these communication systems are highly vulnerable to weather-related disruptions. This results in certain communication opportunities being inefficient in terms of the amount of data received versus the power expended. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method using Deep Q-Networks that takes advantage of weather condition forecasts to improve energy efficiency while delivering the same number of packets as schemes that don't factor weather into routing decisions. We compare this method with simple approaches that utilize simple cloud cover thresholds to improve energy efficiency. In testing the DRL approach provides improved median energy efficiency without a significant reduction in median delivery ratio. Simple cloud cover thresholds were also found to be effective but the thresholds with the highest energy efficiency had reduced median delivery ratio values.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

Manual or random hyperparameter tuning methods can be problematic, as even slight variations in their values can result in significantly different outcomes in the learning process. In this paper, we propose a new method, QF-tuner, for automatic hyperparameter tuning in the Q-learning algorithm using the FOX optimization algorithm (FOX). A new objective function has been proposed for the FOX, prioritizing reward over learning error and time. QF-tuner starts by running the FOX and tries to minimize the fitness value derived from observations at each iteration by executing the Q-learning algorithm. The proposed method has been evaluated using two control tasks from the OpenAI Gym: CartPole and FrozenLake. The empirical results of the QF-tuner on the CartPole control task show a reward of 499, and on the FrozenLake control task, a reward of 1. These results indicate that the QF-tuner outperforms other optimization algorithms. On the FrozenLake control task, there was a 36\% increase in reward with a 26\% reduction in learning time; on the CartPole control task, there was a 57\% increase in reward with a 20\% decrease in learning time. Thus, the QF-tuner is an essential method for hyperparameter tuning in reinforcement learning algorithms, enabling more effective solutions to control task problems.</p></details> | 10 pages |

| **[Selective Uncertainty Propagation in Offline RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00284v4)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the finite-horizon offline reinforcement learning (RL) setting, and are motivated by the challenge of learning the policy at any step h in dynamic programming (DP) algorithms. To learn this, it is sufficient to evaluate the treatment effect of deviating from the behavioral policy at step h after having optimized the policy for all future steps. Since the policy at any step can affect next-state distributions, the related distributional shift challenges can make this problem far more statistically hard than estimating such treatment effects in the stochastic contextual bandit setting. However, the hardness of many real-world RL instances lies between the two regimes. We develop a flexible and general method called selective uncertainty propagation for confidence interval construction that adapts to the hardness of the associated distribution shift challenges. We show benefits of our approach on toy environments and demonstrate the benefits of these techniques for offline policy learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Switch-Type Policy Network for Resource Allocation Problems: Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11136v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has become a powerful tool for developing control policies in queueing networks, but the common use of Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks in these applications has significant drawbacks. MLP architectures, while versatile, often suffer from poor sample efficiency and a tendency to overfit training environments, leading to suboptimal performance on new, unseen networks. In response to these issues, we introduce a switch-type neural network (STN) architecture designed to improve the efficiency and generalization of DRL policies in queueing networks. The STN leverages structural patterns from traditional non-learning policies, ensuring consistent action choices across similar states. This design not only streamlines the learning process but also fosters better generalization by reducing the tendency to overfit. Our works presents three key contributions: first, the development of the STN as a more effective alternative to MLPs; second, empirical evidence showing that STNs achieve superior sample efficiency in various training scenarios; and third, experimental results demonstrating that STNs match MLP performance in familiar environments and significantly outperform them in new settings. By embedding domain-specific knowledge, the STN enhances the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm's effectiveness without compromising performance, suggesting its suitability for a wide range of queueing network control problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[REBEL: Reward Regularization-Based Approach for Robotic Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14436v3)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in continuous control robotics tasks is mainly dependent on the design of the underlying reward function, which is highly prone to reward hacking. A misalignment between the reward function and underlying human preferences (values, social norms) can lead to catastrophic outcomes in the real world especially in the context of robotics for critical decision making. Recent methods aim to mitigate misalignment by learning reward functions from human preferences and subsequently performing policy optimization. However, these methods inadvertently introduce a distribution shift during reward learning due to ignoring the dependence of agent-generated trajectories on the reward learning objective, ultimately resulting in sub-optimal alignment. Hence, in this work, we address this challenge by advocating for the adoption of regularized reward functions that more accurately mirror the intended behaviors of the agent. We propose a novel concept of reward regularization within the robotic RLHF (RL from Human Feedback) framework, which we refer to as \emph{agent preferences}. Our approach uniquely incorporates not just human feedback in the form of preferences but also considers the preferences of the RL agent itself during the reward function learning process. This dual consideration significantly mitigates the issue of distribution shift in RLHF with a computationally tractable algorithm. We provide a theoretical justification for the proposed algorithm by formulating the robotic RLHF problem as a bilevel optimization problem and developing a computationally tractable version of the same. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm {\ours} in several continuous control benchmarks in DeepMind Control Suite \cite{tassa2018deepmind}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Energy Efficient Multi-Functional RIS-Assisted Low-Earth Orbit Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11079v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a novel network architecture that deploys the multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS) in low-Earth orbit (LEO) is proposed. Unlike traditional RIS with only signal reflection capability, the MF-RIS can reflect, refract, and amplify signals, as well as harvest energy from wireless signals. Given the high energy demands in shadow regions where solar energy is unavailable, MF-RIS is deployed in LEO to enhance signal coverage and improve energy efficiency (EE). To address this, we formulate a long-term EE optimization problem by determining the optimal parameters for MF-RIS configurations, including amplification and phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratios, and LEO transmit beamforming. To address the complex non-convex and non-linear problem, a federated learning enhanced multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (FEMAD) scheme is designed. Multi-agent DDPG of each agent can provide the optimal action policy from its interaction to environments, whereas federated learning enables the hidden information exchange among multi-agents. In numerical results, we can observe significant EE improvements compared to the other benchmarks, including centralized deep reinforcement learning as well as distributed multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). Additionally, the proposed LEO-MF-RIS architecture has demonstrated its effectiveness, achieving the highest EE performance compared to the scenarios of fixed/no energy harvesting in MF-RIS, traditional reflection-only RIS, and deployment without RISs/MF-RISs.</p></details> |  |

In order to improve the perception ability of DRL on the network, some studies have combined graph neural networks (GNNs) with DRL, which use the GNNs to extract unstructured features of the network. However, as networks continue to evolve and become increasingly complex, existing GNN-DRL methods still face challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. Moreover, these methods are inadequate for addressing network security issues. From the perspective of security and robustness, this paper explores the solution of combining GNNs with DRL to build a resilient network. This article starts with a brief tutorial of GNNs and DRL, and introduces their existing applications in networks. Furthermore, we introduce the network security methods that can be strengthened by GNN-DRL approaches. Then, we designed a framework based on GNN-DRL to defend against attacks and enhance network resilience. Additionally, we conduct a case study using an encrypted traffic dataset collected from real IoT environments, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our framework. Finally, we highlight key open challenges and opportunities for enhancing network resilience with GNN-DRL.</p></details> |  |

With the development of communication technology, covert communication has expanded from the physical layer to the network and application layers, utilizing methods such as artificial noise, private networks, and semantic coding to transmit secret messages. However, as adversaries continuously eavesdrop on specific communication channels, the accumulation of sufficient data may reveal underlying patterns that influence concealment, and establishing a cross-layer covert communication mechanism emerges as an effective strategy to mitigate these regulatory challenges. In this article, we first survey the communication security solution based on covert communication, specifically targeting three typical scenarios: device-to-device, private network communication, and public network communication, and analyze their application scopes. Furthermore, we propose an end-to-end cross-layer covert communication scheme driven by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), highlighting challenges and their solutions. Additionally, a case study is conducted using diffusion reinforcement learning to sovle cloud edge internet of things cross-layer secure communication.</p></details> |  |

However, DRL faces two critical challenges in human-AI coordination (HAIC): sparse rewards and unpredictable human behaviors. These challenges significantly limit DRL to identify effective coordination policies, due to its impaired capability of optimizing exploration and exploitation. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative behavior- and context-aware reward (BCR) for DRL, which optimizes exploration and exploitation by leveraging human behaviors and contextual information in HAIC. Our BCR consists of two components: (i)~Novel dual intrinsic rewards to enhance exploration. This scheme composes an AI self-motivated intrinsic reward and a human-motivated intrinsic reward, which are designed to increase the capture of sparse rewards by a logarithmic-based strategy; and (ii)~New context-aware weights for the designed rewards to improve exploitation. This mechanism helps the AI agent prioritize actions that better coordinate with the human partner by utilizing contextual information that can reflect the evolution of learning in HAIC. Extensive simulations in the Overcooked environment demonstrate that our approach can increase the cumulative sparse rewards by approximately 20% and reduce the convergence time by about 67% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Beyond NLP, LLMs are increasingly used in software development tasks, such as code completion, modification, bug fixing, and code translation. Software engineers widely use tools like GitHub Copilot and Amazon Q, streamlining workflows and automating tasks with high accuracy. While the resource and energy intensity of LLM training is often highlighted, inference can be even more resource-intensive over time, as it's a continuous process with a high number of invocations. Therefore, developing resource-efficient alternatives for LLM inference is crucial for sustainability. This work proposes GREEN-CODE, a framework for energy-aware code generation in LLMs. GREEN-CODE performs dynamic early exit during LLM inference. We train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that learns to balance the trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and energy consumption. Our approach is evaluated on two open-source LLMs, Llama 3.2 3B and OPT 2.7B, using the JavaCorpus and PY150 datasets. Results show that our method reduces the energy consumption between 23-50 % on average for code generation tasks without significantly affecting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission in ACM/IEEE conference, 11 pages</p></details> |

However, MDRL comes with several challenges that hinder its usability, including sample efficiency, curse of dimensionality, and environment exploration. Recent works proposing Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) to tackle these issues suffer from problems related to model restrictions and maliciousness. Other proposals using reward shaping require considerable engineering and could lead to local optima. In this paper, we propose a novel Blockchain-assisted Multi-Expert Demonstration Cloning (MEDC) framework for MDRL. The proposed method utilizes expert demonstrations in guiding the learning of new MDRL agents, by suggesting exploration actions in the environment. A model sharing framework on Blockchain is designed to allow users to share their trained models, which can be allocated as expert models to requesting users to aid in training MDRL systems. A Consortium Blockchain is adopted to enable traceable and autonomous execution without the need for a single trusted entity. Smart Contracts are designed to manage users and models allocation, which are shared using IPFS. The proposed framework is tested on several applications, and is benchmarked against existing methods in FRL, Reward Shaping, and Imitation Learning-assisted RL. The results show the outperformance of the proposed framework in terms of learning speed and resiliency to faulty and malicious models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Target Localization under Uncertainty using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Knowledge Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10924v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Target localization is a critical task in sensitive applications, where multiple sensing agents communicate and collaborate to identify the target location based on sensor readings. Existing approaches investigated the use of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) to tackle target localization. Nevertheless, these methods do not consider practical uncertainties, like false alarms when the target does not exist or when it is unreachable due to environmental complexities. To address these drawbacks, this work proposes a novel MADRL-based method for target localization in uncertain environments. The proposed MADRL method employs Proximal Policy Optimization to optimize the decision-making of sensing agents, which is represented in the form of an actor-critic structure using Convolutional Neural Networks. The observations of the agents are designed in an optimized manner to capture essential information in the environment, and a team-based reward functions is proposed to produce cooperative agents. The MADRL method covers three action dimensionalities that control the agents' mobility to search the area for the target, detect its existence, and determine its reachability. Using the concept of Transfer Learning, a Deep Learning model builds on the knowledge from the MADRL model to accurately estimating the target location if it is unreachable, resulting in shared representations between the models for faster learning and lower computational complexity. Collectively, the final combined model is capable of searching for the target, determining its existence and reachability, and estimating its location accurately. The proposed method is tested using a radioactive target localization environment and benchmarked against existing methods, showing its efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classical and Deep Reinforcement Learning Inventory Control Policies for Pharmaceutical Supply Chains with Perishability and Non-Stationarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10895v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study inventory control policies for pharmaceutical supply chains, addressing challenges such as perishability, yield uncertainty, and non-stationary demand, combined with batching constraints, lead times, and lost sales. Collaborating with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), we develop a realistic case study incorporating these factors and benchmark three policies--order-up-to (OUT), projected inventory level (PIL), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm--against a BMS baseline based on human expertise. We derive and validate bounds-based procedures for optimizing OUT and PIL policy parameters and propose a methodology for estimating projected inventory levels, which are also integrated into the DRL policy with demand forecasts to improve decision-making under non-stationarity. Compared to a human-driven policy, which avoids lost sales through higher holding costs, all three implemented policies achieve lower average costs but exhibit greater cost variability. While PIL demonstrates robust and consistent performance, OUT struggles under high lost sales costs, and PPO excels in complex and variable scenarios but requires significant computational effort. The findings suggest that while DRL shows potential, it does not outperform classical policies in all numerical experiments, highlighting 1) the need to integrate diverse policies to manage pharmaceutical challenges effectively, based on the current state-of-the-art, and 2) that practical problems in this domain seem to lack a single policy class that yields universally acceptable performance.</p></details> |  |

However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Finite-time analysis of these algorithms has primarily focused on fixed point iterations where both time-scales have contractive mappings. In this paper, we study two-time-scale iterations, where the slower time-scale has a non-expansive mapping. For such algorithms, the slower time-scale can be considered a stochastic inexact Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. We show that the mean square error decays at a rate $O(1/k^{1/4-\epsilon})$, where $\epsilon>0$ is arbitrarily small. We also show almost sure convergence of iterates to the set of fixed points. We show the applicability of our framework by applying our results to minimax optimization, linear stochastic approximation, and Lagrangian optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization</p></details> |
| **[Schedule On the Fly: Diffusion Time Prediction for Faster and Better Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01243v2)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion and flow models have achieved remarkable successes in various applications such as text-to-image generation. However, these models typically rely on the same predetermined denoising schedules during inference for each prompt, which potentially limits the inference efficiency as well as the flexibility when handling different prompts. In this paper, we argue that the optimal noise schedule should adapt to each inference instance, and introduce the Time Prediction Diffusion Model (TPDM) to accomplish this. TPDM employs a plug-and-play Time Prediction Module (TPM) that predicts the next noise level based on current latent features at each denoising step. We train the TPM using reinforcement learning, aiming to maximize a reward that discounts the final image quality by the number of denoising steps. With such an adaptive scheduler, TPDM not only generates high-quality images that are aligned closely with human preferences but also adjusts the number of denoising steps and time on the fly, enhancing both performance and efficiency. We train TPDMs on multiple diffusion model benchmarks. With Stable Diffusion 3 Medium architecture, TPDM achieves an aesthetic score of 5.44 and a human preference score (HPS) of 29.59, while using around 50% fewer denoising steps to achieve better performance. We will release our best model alongside this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous Fractional Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Age-Minimal Mobile Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16832v4)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of emerging real-time networked applications like cyber-physical systems (CPS), the Age of Information (AoI) has merged as a pivotal metric for evaluating the timeliness. To meet the high computational demands, such as those in intelligent manufacturing within CPS, mobile edge computing (MEC) presents a promising solution for optimizing computing and reducing AoI. In this work, we study the timeliness of computational-intensive updates and explores jointly optimize the task updating and offloading policies to minimize AoI. Specifically, we consider edge load dynamics and formulate a task scheduling problem to minimize the expected time-average AoI. The fractional objective introduced by AoI and the semi-Markov game nature of the problem render this challenge particularly difficult, with existing approaches not directly applicable. To this end, we present a comprehensive framework to fractional reinforcement learning (RL). We first introduce a fractional single-agent RL framework and prove its linear convergence. We then extend this to a fractional multi-agent RL framework with a convergence analysis. To tackle the challenge of asynchronous control in semi-Markov game, we further design an asynchronous model-free fractional multi-agent RL algorithm, where each device makes scheduling decisions with the hybrid action space without knowing the system dynamics and decisions of other devices. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms reduce the average AoI by up to 52.6% compared with the best baseline algorithm in our experiments.</p></details> |  |

Existing preconditioners such as Jacobi, Incomplete LU, and Algebraic Multigrid methods offer problem-specific advantages but rely heavily on hyperparameter tuning. Recent advances have explored using deep neural networks to learn preconditioners, though challenges such as misbehaved objective functions and costly training procedures remain. PEARL introduces a reinforcement learning approach for learning preconditioners, specifically, a contextual bandit formulation. The framework utilizes an actor-critic model, where the actor generates the incomplete Cholesky decomposition of preconditioners, and the critic evaluates them based on reward-specific feedback. To further guide the training, we design a dual-objective function, combining updates from the critic and condition number. PEARL contributes a generalizable preconditioner learning method, dynamic sparsity exploration, and cosine schedulers for improved stability and exploratory power. We compare our approach to traditional and neural preconditioners, demonstrating improved flexibility and iterative solving speed.</p></details> |  |

However, it faces two major challenges: policy instability and sampling bottlenecks. In this paper, we revisit ensemble methods with massively parallel simulations on graphics processing units (GPUs), significantly enhancing the computational efficiency and robustness of trained models in volatile financial markets. Our approach leverages the parallel processing capability of GPUs to significantly improve the sampling speed for training ensemble models. The ensemble models combine the strengths of component agents to improve the robustness of financial decision-making strategies. We conduct experiments in both stock and cryptocurrency trading tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Massively parallel simulation on a single GPU improves the sampling speed by up to $1,746\times$ using $2,048$ parallel environments compared to a single environment. The ensemble models have high cumulative returns and outperform some individual agents, reducing maximum drawdown by up to $4.17\%$ and improving the Sharpe ratio by up to $0.21$. This paper describes trading tasks at ACM ICAIF FinRL Contests in 2023 and 2024.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Interpretable Neural Control Network with Adaptable Online Learning for Sample Efficient Robot Locomotion Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10698v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot locomotion learning using reinforcement learning suffers from training sample inefficiency and exhibits the non-understandable/black-box nature. Thus, this work presents a novel SME-AGOL to address such problems. Firstly, Sequential Motion Executor (SME) is a three-layer interpretable neural network, where the first produces the sequentially propagating hidden states, the second constructs the corresponding triangular bases with minor non-neighbor interference, and the third maps the bases to the motor commands. Secondly, the Adaptable Gradient-weighting Online Learning (AGOL) algorithm prioritizes the update of the parameters with high relevance score, allowing the learning to focus more on the highly relevant ones. Thus, these two components lead to an analyzable framework, where each sequential hidden state/basis represents the learned key poses/robot configuration. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the SME-AGOL requires 40% fewer samples and receives 150% higher final reward/locomotion performance on a simulated hexapod robot, while taking merely 10 minutes of learning time from scratch on a physical hexapod robot. Taken together, this work not only proposes the SME-AGOL for sample efficient and understandable locomotion learning but also emphasizes the potential exploitation of interpretability for improving sample efficiency and learning performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 Figures + 6 Figures in supplementary material section, 2 Tables, submitted to TNNLS (minor revision; revision submitted 5 October 2024)</p></details> |

However, existing approaches often struggle to achieve both objectives. In this paper, based on that empathic responses are modulated by inferred social relationships between agents, we propose LASE Learning to balance Altruism and Self-interest based on Empathy), a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that fosters altruistic cooperation through gifting while avoiding exploitation by other agents in mixed-motive games. LASE allocates a portion of its rewards to co-players as gifts, with this allocation adapting dynamically based on the social relationship -- a metric evaluating the friendliness of co-players estimated by counterfactual reasoning. In particular, social relationship measures each co-player by comparing the estimated $Q$-function of current joint action to a counterfactual baseline which marginalizes the co-player's action, with its action distribution inferred by a perspective-taking module. Comprehensive experiments are performed in spatially and temporally extended mixed-motive games, demonstrating LASE's ability to promote group collaboration without compromising fairness and its capacity to adapt policies to various types of interactive co-players.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically rely on gate-cycle priors or designated contact sensors. We design a contact estimator that is suitable for the emerging wheeled-biped robot types that do not have these features. To this end, we propose a Bayes filter in which update steps are learned from real-robot torque measurements while prediction steps rely on inertial measurements. We evaluate this approach in extensive real-robot and simulation experiments. Our method achieves better performance while being considerably more sample efficient than a comparable deep-learning baseline.</p></details> |  |

Their ability to adapt to surroundings, combined with advancements in actuation and manufacturing technologies, allows them to perform specialized manipulation tasks. This work presents an approach for design optimization of soft growing robots; specifically, the three-dimensional extension of the optimizer designed for planar manipulators. This tool is intended to be used by engineers and robot enthusiasts before manufacturing their robot: it suggests the optimal size of the robot for solving a specific task. The design process models a multi-objective optimization problem to refine a soft manipulator's kinematic chain. Thanks to the novel Rank Partitioning algorithm integrated into Evolutionary Computation (EC) algorithms, this method achieves high precision in reaching targets and is efficient in resource usage. Results show significantly high performance in solving three-dimensional tasks, whereas comparative experiments indicate that the optimizer features robust output when tested with different EC algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[A 3-Step Optimization Framework with Hybrid Models for a Humanoid Robot's Jump Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12594v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High dynamic jump motions are challenging tasks for humanoid robots to achieve environment adaptation and obstacle crossing. The trajectory optimization is a practical method to achieve high-dynamic and explosive jumping. This paper proposes a 3-step trajectory optimization framework for generating a jump motion for a humanoid robot. To improve iteration speed and achieve ideal performance, the framework comprises three sub-optimizations. The first optimization incorporates momentum, inertia, and center of pressure (CoP), treating the robot as a static reaction momentum pendulum (SRMP) model to generate corresponding trajectories. The second optimization maps these trajectories to joint space using effective Quadratic Programming (QP) solvers. Finally, the third optimization generates whole-body joint trajectories utilizing trajectories generated by previous parts. With the combined consideration of momentum and inertia, the robot achieves agile forward jump motions. A simulation and experiments (Fig. \ref{Fig First page fig}) of forward jump with a distance of 1.0 m and 0.5 m height are presented in this paper, validating the applicability of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

For robots to interact more naturally with humans, robot movement design should likewise integrate expressive qualities, such as intention, attention, and emotions, alongside traditional functional considerations like task fulfillment and time efficiency. In this paper, we present the design and prototyping of a lamp-like robot that explores the interplay between functional and expressive objectives in movement design. Using a research-through-design methodology, we document the hardware design process, define expressive movement primitives, and outline a set of interaction scenario storyboards. We propose a framework that incorporates both functional and expressive utilities during movement generation, and implement the robot behavior sequences in different function- and social- oriented tasks. Through a user study comparing expression-driven versus function-driven movements across six task scenarios, our findings indicate that expression-driven movements significantly enhance user engagement and perceived robot qualities. This effect is especially pronounced in social-oriented tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, manuscript under review</p></details> |

To improve the understanding of the robot, we have developed four levels of explanation (LOE) based on two questions: what needs to be explained, and why the robot has made a particular decision. The understandable robot requires a communicative action when there is disparity between the human s mental model of the robot and the robots state of mind. This communicative action was generated by utilizing a conversational AI platform to generate explanations. An adaptive dialog was implemented for transition from one LOE to another. Here, we demonstrate the adaptive dialog in a collaborative task with errors and provide results of a feasibility study with users.</p></details> | <details><summary>40th ...</summary><p>40th Anniversary, IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation,2024</p></details> |

In practice, when encountering unpredictable behavior of people or unexpected states of the environment, these frameworks may lack the ability to dynamically recognize such states, adapt and recover to resume the interaction. Large Language Models (LLMs), owing to their advanced reasoning capabilities and context retention, present a promising solution for enhancing robot adaptability. This potential, however, may not directly translate to improved interaction metrics. This paper considers a representative interaction with an industrial robot involving approach, instruction, and object manipulation, implemented in two conditions: (1) fully scripted and (2) including LLM-enhanced responses. We use gaze tracking and questionnaires to measure the participants' task efficiency, engagement, and robot perception. The results indicate higher subjective ratings for the LLM condition, but objective metrics show that the scripted condition performs comparably, particularly in efficiency and focus during simple tasks. We also note that the scripted condition may have an edge over LLM-enhanced responses in terms of response latency and energy consumption, especially for trivial and repetitive interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Late-Breaking Report to the 2025, 20th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)</p></details> |
| **[Towards autonomous photogrammetric forest inventory using a lightweight under-canopy robotic drone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12073v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drones are increasingly used in forestry to capture high-resolution remote sensing data. While operations above the forest canopy are already highly automated, flying inside forests remains challenging, primarily relying on manual piloting. Inside dense forests, reliance on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for localization is not feasible. Additionally, the drone must autonomously adjust its flight path to avoid collisions. Recently, advancements in robotics have enabled autonomous drone flights in GNSS-denied obstacle-rich areas. In this article, a step towards autonomous forest data collection is taken by building a prototype of a robotic under-canopy drone utilizing state-of-the-art open-source methods and validating its performance for data collection inside forests. The autonomous flight capability was evaluated through multiple test flights in two boreal forest test sites. The tree parameter estimation capability was studied by conducting diameter at breast height (DBH) estimation using onboard stereo camera data and photogrammetric methods. The prototype conducted flights in selected challenging forest environments, and the experiments showed excellent performance in forest reconstruction with a miniaturized stereoscopic photogrammetric system. The stem detection algorithm managed to identify 79.31 % of the stems. The DBH estimation had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.33 cm (12.79 %) and a bias of 1.01 cm (3.87 %) across all trees. For trees with a DBH less than 30 cm, the RMSE was 1.16 cm (5.74 %), and the bias was 0.13 cm (0.64 %). When considering the overall performance in terms of DBH accuracy, autonomy, and forest complexity, the proposed approach was superior compared to methods proposed in the scientific literature. Results provided valuable insights into autonomous forest reconstruction using drones, and several further development topics were proposed.</p></details> | 35 pages, 13 Figures |

Our software is able to handle large numbers of objects and materials in real-time, making it suitable for use in a variety of mobile robotics applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RadaRays through a series of experiments and show that it can more accurately reproduce the behavior of FMCW radar sensors in a variety of environments, compared to the ray casting-based lidar-like simulations that are commonly used in simulators for autonomous driving such as CARLA. Our experiments additionally serve as a valuable reference point for researchers to evaluate their own radar simulations. By using RadaRays, developers can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with prototyping and testing FMCW radar-based algorithms. We also provide a Gazebo plugin that makes our work accessible to the mobile robotics community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concurrent-Learning Based Relative Localization in Shape Formation of Robot Swarms (Extended version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06052v4)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the shape formation problem for massive robot swarms in environments where external localization systems are unavailable. Achieving this task effectively with solely onboard measurements is still scarcely explored and faces some practical challenges. To solve this challenging problem, we propose the following novel results. Firstly, to estimate the relative positions among neighboring robots, a concurrent-learning based estimator is proposed. It relaxes the persistent excitation condition required in the classical ones such as least-square estimator. Secondly, we introduce a finite-time agreement protocol to determine the shape location. This is achieved by estimating the relative position between each robot and a randomly assigned seed robot. The initial position of the seed one marks the shape location. Thirdly, based on the theoretical results of the relative localization, a novel behavior-based control strategy is devised. This strategy not only enables adaptive shape formation of large group of robots but also enhances the observability of inter-robot relative localization. Numerical simulation results are provided to verify the performance of our proposed strategy compared to the state-of-the-art ones. Additionally, outdoor experiments on real robots further demonstrate the practical effectiveness and robustness of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating Robot Swarm Through a Virtual Tube with Flow-Adaptive Distribution Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11938v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of robot swarm technology and its diverse applications, navigating robot swarms through complex environments has emerged as a critical research direction. To ensure safe navigation and avoid potential collisions with obstacles, the concept of virtual tubes has been introduced to define safe and navigable regions. However, current control methods in virtual tubes face the congestion issues, particularly in narrow virtual tubes with low throughput. To address these challenges, we first originally introduce the concepts of virtual tube area and flow capacity, and develop an new evolution model for the spatial density function. Next, we propose a novel control method that combines a modified artificial potential field (APF) for swarm navigation and density feedback control for distribution regulation, under which a saturated velocity command is designed. Then, we generate a global velocity field that not only ensures collision-free navigation through the virtual tube, but also achieves locally input-to-state stability (LISS) for density tracking errors, both of which are rigorously proven. Finally, numerical simulations and realistic applications validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method in managing robot swarms within narrow virtual tubes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Connection-Coordination Rapport (CCR) Scale: A Dual-Factor Scale to Measure Human-Robot Rapport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11887v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots, particularly in service and companionship roles, must develop positive relationships with people they interact with regularly to be successful. These positive human-robot relationships can be characterized as establishing "rapport," which indicates mutual understanding and interpersonal connection that form the groundwork for successful long-term human-robot interaction. However, the human-robot interaction research literature lacks scale instruments to assess human-robot rapport in a variety of situations. In this work, we developed the 18-item Connection-Coordination Rapport (CCR) Scale to measure human-robot rapport. We first ran Study 1 (N = 288) where online participants rated videos of human-robot interactions using a set of candidate items. Our Study 1 results showed the discovery of two factors in our scale, which we named "Connection" and "Coordination." We then evaluated this scale by running Study 2 (N = 201) where online participants rated a new set of human-robot interaction videos with our scale and an existing rapport scale from virtual agents research for comparison. We also validated our scale by replicating a prior in-person human-robot interaction study, Study 3 (N = 44), and found that rapport is rated significantly greater when participants interacted with a responsive robot (responsive condition) as opposed to an unresponsive robot (unresponsive condition). Results from these studies demonstrate high reliability and validity for the CCR scale, which can be used to measure rapport in both first-person and third-person perspectives. We encourage the adoption of this scale in future studies to measure rapport in a variety of human-robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Force-Aware Autonomous Robotic Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11742v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work demonstrates the benefits of using tool-tissue interaction forces in the design of autonomous systems in robot-assisted surgery (RAS). Autonomous systems in surgery must manipulate tissues of different stiffness levels and hence should apply different levels of forces accordingly. We hypothesize that this ability is enabled by using force measurements as input to policies learned from human demonstrations. To test this hypothesis, we use Action-Chunking Transformers (ACT) to train two policies through imitation learning for automated tissue retraction with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). To quantify the effects of using tool-tissue interaction force data, we trained a "no force policy" that uses the vision and robot kinematic data, and compared it to a "force policy" that uses force, vision and robot kinematic data. When tested on a previously seen tissue sample, the force policy is 3 times more successful in autonomously performing the task compared with the no force policy. In addition, the force policy is more gentle with the tissue compared with the no force policy, exerting on average 62% less force on the tissue. When tested on a previously unseen tissue sample, the force policy is 3.5 times more successful in autonomously performing the task, exerting an order of magnitude less forces on the tissue, compared with the no force policy. These results open the door to design force-aware autonomous systems that can meet the surgical guidelines for tissue handling, especially using the newly released RAS systems with force feedback capabilities such as the da Vinci 5.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Semidefinite Relaxations for Matrix-Weighted State-Estimation Problems in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07275v4)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in the development of so-called certifiable perception methods, which leverage semidefinite, convex relaxations to find global optima of perception problems in robotics. However, many of these relaxations rely on simplifying assumptions that facilitate the problem formulation, such as an isotropic measurement noise distribution. In this paper, we explore the tightness of the semidefinite relaxations of matrix-weighted (anisotropic) state-estimation problems and reveal the limitations lurking therein: matrix-weighted factors can cause convex relaxations to lose tightness. In particular, we show that the semidefinite relaxations of localization problems with matrix weights may be tight only for low noise levels. To better understand this issue, we introduce a theoretical connection between the posterior uncertainty of the state estimate and the certificate matrix obtained via convex relaxation. With this connection in mind, we empirically explore the factors that contribute to this loss of tightness and demonstrate that redundant constraints can be used to regain it. As a second technical contribution of this paper, we show that the state-of-the-art relaxation of scalar-weighted SLAM cannot be used when matrix weights are considered. We provide an alternate formulation and show that its SDP relaxation is not tight (even for very low noise levels) unless specific redundant constraints are used. We demonstrate the tightness of our formulations on both simulated and real-world data.</p></details> |  |

The scenarios highlight how personalization can be achieved through more human-robot collaboration, particularly in relation to individuals with visual, physical, cognitive, auditory impairments, clinical needs, environmental factors (noise, light levels, clutter), and daily living activities. Our goal is for this contribution to prompt reflection and aid in the design of improved robots (embodiment, sensors, actuation, cognition) and their behavior, and we aim to introduces a groundbreaking strategy to enhance human-robot collaboration, addressing the complexities of decision-making under uncertainty through a Scenario analysis approach. By emphasizing user-centered design principles and offering actionable solutions to real-world challenges, this work aims to identify key decision-making challenges and propose potential solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TAROS 2024</p></details> |

We develop a novel algorithm that leverages the presence of other assistive devices: a Hoyer sling and a wheelchair for coarse manipulation of heavy loads, alongside a robot arm for fine-grained manipulation of deformable objects (Hoyer sling straps). We instrument the Hoyer sling and wheelchair with actuators and sensors so that they can become intelligent agents in the algorithm. We then focus on one subtask of the transferring ADL -- tying Hoyer sling straps to the sling bar -- that exemplifies the challenges of transfer: multi-agent planning, deformable object manipulation, and generalization to varying hook shapes, sling materials, and care recipient bodies. To address these challenges, we propose CART-MPC, a novel algorithm based on turn-taking multi-agent model predictive control that uses a learned neural dynamics model for a keypoint-based representation of the deformable Hoyer sling strap, and a novel cost function that leverages linking numbers from knot theory and neural amortization to accelerate inference. We validate it in both RCareWorld simulation and real-world environments. In simulation, CART-MPC successfully generalizes across diverse hook designs, sling materials, and care recipient body shapes. In the real world, we show zero-shot sim-to-real generalization capabilities to tie deformable Hoyer sling straps on a sling bar towards transferring a manikin from a hospital bed to a wheelchair.

| **[REBEL: Reward Regularization-Based Approach for Robotic Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14436v3)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in continuous control robotics tasks is mainly dependent on the design of the underlying reward function, which is highly prone to reward hacking. A misalignment between the reward function and underlying human preferences (values, social norms) can lead to catastrophic outcomes in the real world especially in the context of robotics for critical decision making. Recent methods aim to mitigate misalignment by learning reward functions from human preferences and subsequently performing policy optimization. However, these methods inadvertently introduce a distribution shift during reward learning due to ignoring the dependence of agent-generated trajectories on the reward learning objective, ultimately resulting in sub-optimal alignment. Hence, in this work, we address this challenge by advocating for the adoption of regularized reward functions that more accurately mirror the intended behaviors of the agent. We propose a novel concept of reward regularization within the robotic RLHF (RL from Human Feedback) framework, which we refer to as \emph{agent preferences}. Our approach uniquely incorporates not just human feedback in the form of preferences but also considers the preferences of the RL agent itself during the reward function learning process. This dual consideration significantly mitigates the issue of distribution shift in RLHF with a computationally tractable algorithm. We provide a theoretical justification for the proposed algorithm by formulating the robotic RLHF problem as a bilevel optimization problem and developing a computationally tractable version of the same. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm {\ours} in several continuous control benchmarks in DeepMind Control Suite \cite{tassa2018deepmind}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Front Hair Styling Robot System Using Path Planning for Root-Centric Strand Adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10991v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hair styling is a crucial aspect of personal grooming, significantly influenced by the appearance of front hair. While brushing is commonly used both to detangle hair and for styling purposes, existing research primarily focuses on robotic systems for detangling hair, with limited exploration into robotic hair styling. This research presents a novel robotic system designed to automatically adjust front hairstyles, with an emphasis on path planning for root-centric strand adjustment. The system utilizes images to compare the current hair state with the desired target state through an orientation map of hair strands. By concentrating on the differences in hair orientation and specifically targeting adjustments at the root of each strand, the system performs detailed styling tasks. The path planning approach ensures effective alignment of the hairstyle with the target, and a closed-loop mechanism refines these adjustments to accurately evolve the hairstyle towards the desired outcome. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a high degree of similarity and consistency in front hair styling, showing promising results for automated, precise hairstyle adjustments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/SICE SII2025</p></details> |

Previous studies have attempted to address this issue through the development of a new BC technique: Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC). This new technique consistently outperformed the conventional Mean Squared Error (MSE) BC models in a variety of tasks. Our goal is to replicate the performance of the IBC model by Florence [in Proceedings of the 5th Conference on Robot Learning, 164:158-168, 2022], for social interaction tasks using our custom dataset. While previous studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for enhancing group conversations, they often overlook the significance of non-verbal cues, which constitute a substantial part of human communication. We propose using IBC to replicate nonverbal cues like gaze behaviors. The model is evaluated against various types of facilitator data and compared to an explicit, MSE BC model. Results show that the IBC model outperforms the MSE BC model across session types using the same metrics used in the previous IBC paper. Despite some metrics showing mixed results which are explainable for the custom dataset for social interaction, we successfully replicated the IBC model to generate nonverbal cues. Our contributions are (1) the replication and extension of the IBC model, and (2) a nonverbal cues generation model for social interaction. These advancements facilitate the integration of robots into the complex interactions between robots and humans, e.g., in the absence of a human facilitator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to as a short contribution to HRI2025</p></details> |

A good replacement for human intervention can be offered by climbing robots. The different solutions existing in the literature are not up to the task for the difficulty of the requirements (navigation, heavy payloads, flexibility in the execution of the tasks). In this paper, we propose a robotic platform that can fill this gap. Our solution is based on a robot that hangs on ropes, and uses a retractable leg to jump away from the mountain walls. Our package of mechanical solutions, along with the algorithms developed for motion planning and control, delivers swift navigation on irregular and steep slopes, the possibility to overcome or travel around significant natural barriers, and the ability to carry heavy payloads and execute complex tasks. In the paper, we give a full account of our main design and algorithmic choices and show the feasibility of the solution through a large number of physically simulated scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Thus, this work presents a novel SME-AGOL to address such problems. Firstly, Sequential Motion Executor (SME) is a three-layer interpretable neural network, where the first produces the sequentially propagating hidden states, the second constructs the corresponding triangular bases with minor non-neighbor interference, and the third maps the bases to the motor commands. Secondly, the Adaptable Gradient-weighting Online Learning (AGOL) algorithm prioritizes the update of the parameters with high relevance score, allowing the learning to focus more on the highly relevant ones. Thus, these two components lead to an analyzable framework, where each sequential hidden state/basis represents the learned key poses/robot configuration. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the SME-AGOL requires 40% fewer samples and receives 150% higher final reward/locomotion performance on a simulated hexapod robot, while taking merely 10 minutes of learning time from scratch on a physical hexapod robot. Taken together, this work not only proposes the SME-AGOL for sample efficient and understandable locomotion learning but also emphasizes the potential exploitation of interpretability for improving sample efficiency and learning performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 Figures + 6 Figures in supplementary material section, 2 Tables, submitted to TNNLS (minor revision; revision submitted 5 October 2024)</p></details> |

Leaf-level hyperspectral spectroscopy is shown to be a powerful tool for phenotyping, monitoring crop health, identifying essential nutrients within plants as well as detecting diseases and water stress. This work introduces RoMu4o, a robotic manipulation unit for orchard operations offering an automated solution for proximal hyperspectral leaf sensing. This ground robot is equipped with a 6DOF robotic arm and vision system for real-time deep learning-based image processing and motion planning. We developed robust perception and manipulation pipelines that enable the robot to successfully grasp target leaves and perform spectroscopy. These frameworks operate synergistically to identify and extract the 3D structure of leaves from an observed batch of foliage, propose 6D poses, and generate collision-free constraint-aware paths for precise leaf manipulation. The end-effector of the arm features a compact design that integrates an independent lighting source with a hyperspectral sensor, enabling high-fidelity data acquisition while streamlining the calibration process for accurate measurements. Our ground robot is engineered to operate in unstructured orchard environments. However, the performance of the system is evaluated in both indoor and outdoor plant models. The system demonstrated reliable performance for 1-LPB hyperspectral sampling, achieving 95% success rate in lab trials and 79% in field trials. Field experiments revealed an overall success rate of 70% for autonomous leaf grasping and hyperspectral measurement in a pistachio orchard.

Current robot deployments, which oftentimes rely on static configurations (of the OS, applications, etc.) and system over-provisioning, fall short since they do not account for the tasks' performance variations resulting in poor system-wide behavior such as robot instability and/or inefficient resource use. This paper presents ConfigBot, a system designed to adaptively reconfigure AMSR applications to meet a predefined performance specification by leveraging runtime profiling and automated configuration tuning. Through experiments on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot equipped with NVIDIA AGX Orin, we demonstrate ConfigBot's efficacy in maintaining system stability and optimizing resource allocation across diverse scenarios.

Its strength is based on the passivity theorem, which provides a powerful interconnection framework for robotics. However, the design of passivity-based controllers and their optimal tuning remain challenging. We propose here an intuitive design approach for fully actuated robots, where the control action is determined by a `virtual-mechanism' as in classical virtual model control. The result is a robot whose controlled behavior can be understood in terms of physics. We achieve optimal tuning by applying algorithmic differentiation to ODE simulations of the rigid body dynamics. Overall, this leads to a flexible design and optimization approach: stability is proven by passivity of the virtual mechanism, while performance is obtained by optimization using algorithmic differentiation.</p></details> | 14 pages, 17 figures |

We propose a non-autoregressive transformer architecture to leverage its parallel nature for easier training and fast, accurate predictions at test time. The proposed architecture divides human motion prediction into two parts: 1) the human trajectory, which is the hip joint 3D position over time and 2) the human pose which is the all other joints 3D positions over time with respect to a fixed hip joint. We propose to make the two predictions simultaneously, as the shared representation can improve the model performance. Therefore, the model consists of two sets of encoders and decoders. First, a multi-head attention module applied to encoder outputs improves human trajectory. Second, another multi-head self-attention module applied to encoder outputs concatenated with decoder outputs facilitates learning of temporal dependencies. Our model is well-suited for robotic applications in terms of test accuracy and speed, and compares favorably with respect to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our work via the Robot Follow-Ahead task, a challenging yet practical case study for our proposed model.</p></details> |  |

The system, named SPLITTER, comprises two sub-10 kg quadrupedal robots connected by a tether, capable of executing successive jumping gaits and stabilizing in-flight using inertial morphing technology. Through model predictive control (MPC), attitude control was demonstrated by adjusting the limbs and tether length to modulate the system's principal moments of inertia. Our results indicate that this control strategy allows the robot to stabilize during flight phases without needing traditional flywheel-based systems or relying on aerodynamics, making the approach mass-efficient and ideal for small-scale planetary robots' successive jumps. The paper outlines the dynamics, MPC formulation for inertial morphing, actuator requirements, and simulation results, illustrating the potential of agile exploration for small-scale rovers in low-gravity environments like the Moon or asteroids.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceeding to IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce a novel framework for learning world models that accurately capture complex, partially observable, and stochastic dynamics. The proposed method employs a dual-autoregressive mechanism and self-supervised training to achieve reliable long-horizon predictions without relying on domain-specific inductive biases, ensuring adaptability across diverse robotic tasks. We further propose a policy optimization framework that leverages world models for efficient training in imagined environments and seamless deployment in real-world systems. Through extensive experiments, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior autoregressive prediction accuracy, robustness to noise, and generalization across manipulation and locomotion tasks. Notably, policies trained with our method are successfully deployed on ANYmal D hardware in a zero-shot transfer, achieving robust performance with minimal sim-to-real performance loss. This work advances model-based reinforcement learning by addressing the challenges of long-horizon prediction, error accumulation, and sim-to-real transfer. By providing a scalable and robust framework, the introduced methods pave the way for adaptive and efficient robotic systems in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Our method introduces a distributionally robust control barrier function (DR-CBF) that directly integrates noisy sensor measurements and state estimates to define safety constraints. This approach is applicable to a wide range of control-affine dynamics, generalizable to robots with complex geometries, and capable of operating at real-time control frequencies. Coupled with a control Lyapunov function (CLF) for path following, the proposed CLF-DR-CBF control synthesis method achieves safe, robust, and efficient navigation in challenging environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach for safe autonomous navigation under uncertainty in simulations and real-world experiments with differential-drive robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://existentialrobotics.org/DRO_Safe_Navigation</p></details> |

In this paper, we address the problem of planning in uncertain environments with a heterogeneous robot team of fast scout vehicles for information gathering and more risk-averse carrier robots from which the scouts vehicles are deployed. To overcome the computational challenges, we represent the environment and operational scenario using a topological graph, where the parameters of the edge weight distributions vary with the state of the robot team on the graph, and we formulate a computationally efficient mixed-integer program which removes the dependence on the number of robots from its decision space. Our formulation results in the capability to generate optimal multi-robot, long-horizon plans in seconds that could otherwise be computationally intractable. Ultimately our approach enables real-time re-planning, since the computation time is significantly faster than the time to execute one step. We evaluate our approach in a scenario where the robot team must traverse an environment while minimizing detection by observers in positions that are uncertain to the robot team. We demonstrate that our approach is computationally tractable, can improve performance in the presence of imperfect information, and can be adjusted for different risk profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

To enhance scene reconstruction efficiency and ensure robot safety, we propose the Risk-aware Environment Masking (RaEM) framework. RaEM leverages coherent risk measures to dynamically prioritize safety-critical regions of the unknown environment, guiding active view acquisition algorithms toward identifying the next-best-view (NBV). Integrated with FisherRF, which selects the NBV by maximizing expected information gain, our framework achieves a dual objective: improving robot safety and increasing efficiency in risk-aware 3D scene reconstruction and understanding. Extensive high-fidelity experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to establish a robust and safety-focused framework for active robot exploration and 3D scene understanding.</p></details> |  |

This study implements a visual flocking model in a ``robot-in-the-loop'' approach to reproduce these behaviors with a flock composed of 10 independent spherical robots. The model achieves robotic collective motion by only using panoramic visual information of each robot, such as retinal position, optical size and optic flow of the neighboring robots. We introduce a virtual anchor to confine the collective robotic movements so to avoid wall interactions. For the first time, a simple visual robot-in-the-loop approach succeed in reproducing several collective motion phases, in particular, swarming, and milling. Another milestone achieved with by this model is bridging the gap between simulation and physical experiments by demonstrating nearly identical behaviors in both environments with the same visual model. To conclude, we show that our minimal visual collective motion model is sufficient to recreate most collective behaviors on a robot-in-the-loop system that is scalable, behaves as numerical simulations predict and is easily comparable to traditional models.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 16 figures, journal bioinspired and biomimetics</p></details> |

This limits their ability to reach certain configurations necessary for tasks such as inspection and pushing objects up. We have overcome this limitation by creating an electrically driven metamaterial soft arm using handed shearing auxetics (HSA) and bendable extendable torque resistant (BETR) shafts. These use the large force and torque capacity of HSAs and the nestable torque transmission of BETRs to create a strong soft arm. We found that the HSA arm was able to push 2.3 kg vertically and lift more than 600 g when positioned horizontally, supporting 0.33 Nm of torque at the base. The arm is able to move between waypoints while carrying the large payload and demonstrates consistent movement with path variance below 5 mm. The HSA arm's ability to perform active grasping with HSA grippers was also demonstrated, requiring 20 N of pull force to dislodge the object. Finally, we test the arm in a pipe inspection task. The arm is able to locate all the defects while sliding against the inner surface of the pipe, demonstrating its compliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, currently under review</p></details> |

For example, cutting the carrot requires adhering to a geometric constraint: the blade of the knife should be perpendicular to the carrot's direction. By interpreting these constraints through symbolic language representations and translating them into low-level actions, GeoManip bridges the gap between natural language and robotic execution, enabling greater generalizability across diverse even unseen tasks, objects, and scenarios. Unlike vision-language-action models that require extensive training, operates training-free by utilizing large foundational models: a constraint generation module that predicts stage-specific geometric constraints and a geometry parser that identifies object parts involved in these constraints. A solver then optimizes trajectories to satisfy inferred constraints from task descriptions and the scene. Furthermore, GeoManip learns in-context and provides five appealing human-robot interaction features: on-the-fly policy adaptation, learning from human demonstrations, learning from failure cases, long-horizon action planning, and efficient data collection for imitation learning. Extensive evaluations on both simulations and real-world scenarios demonstrate GeoManip's state-of-the-art performance, with superior out-of-distribution generalization while avoiding costly model training.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |

However, due to the complexity of deployment environments or the prevalence of ambiguous-condition objects, the practical application of robotics still faces many challenges, leading to frequent errors. Traditional methods and some LLM-based approaches, although improved, still require substantial human intervention and struggle with autonomous error correction in complex scenarios.In this work, we propose RoboReflect, a novel framework leveraging large vision-language models (LVLMs) to enable self-reflection and autonomous error correction in robotic grasping tasks. RoboReflect allows robots to automatically adjust their strategies based on unsuccessful attempts until successful execution is achieved.The corrected strategies are saved in a memory for future task reference.We evaluate RoboReflect through extensive testing on eight common objects prone to ambiguous conditions of three categories.Our results demonstrate that RoboReflect not only outperforms existing grasp pose estimation methods like AnyGrasp and high-level action planning techniques using GPT-4V but also significantly enhances the robot's ability to adapt and correct errors independently. These findings underscore the critical importance of autonomous selfreflection in robotic systems while effectively addressing the challenges posed by ambiguous environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interoceptive Robots for Convergent Shared Control in Collaborative Construction Work](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09290v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) with optimized efficiency and adaptive capabilities-able to respond to changing task demands and dynamic environments-is a strongly desired goal for advancing construction robotics. Such robots can play a critical role in enabling automation, reducing operational carbon footprints, and supporting modular construction processes. Inspired by the adaptive autonomy of living organisms, we introduce interoception, which centers on the robot's internal state representation, as a foundation for developing self-reflection and conscious learning to enable continual learning and adaptability in robotic agents. In this paper, we factorize internal state variables and mathematical properties as "cognitive dissonance" in shared control paradigms, where human interventions occasionally occur. We offer a new perspective on how interoception can help build adaptive motion planning in AMRs by integrating the legacy of heuristic costs from grid/graph-based algorithms with recent advances in neuroscience and reinforcement learning. Declarative and procedural knowledge extracted from human semantic inputs is encoded into a hypergraph model that overlaps with the spatial configuration of onsite layout for path planning. In addition, we design a velocity-replay module using an encoder-decoder architecture with few-shot learning to enable robots to replicate velocity profiles in contextualized scenarios for multi-robot synchronization and handover collaboration. These "cached" knowledge representations are demonstrated in simulated environments for multi-robot motion planning and stacking tasks. The insights from this study pave the way toward artificial general intelligence in AMRs, fostering their progression from complexity to competence in construction automation.</p></details> |  |

Both avenues have, however, shown their limitations; the former lacks structure and performs poorly outside training data, while the latter requires significant simplifications and extensive expert knowledge to be used in practice. This paper introduces a streamlined method for learning low-dimensional, physics-based models that are both accurate and easy to interpret. We start with an algorithm that uses image data (i.e., shape evolutions) to determine the minimal necessary segments for describing a soft robot's movement. Following this, we apply a dynamic regression and strain sparsification algorithm to identify relevant strains and define the model's dynamics. We validate our approach through simulations with various planar soft manipulators, comparing its performance against other learning strategies, showing that our models are both computationally efficient and 25x more accurate on out-of-training distribution inputs. Finally, we demonstrate that thanks to the capability of the method of generating physically compatible models, the learned models can be straightforwardly combined with model-based control policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, appearing in Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE 8th International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)</p></details> |

This paper investigates, for the first time, the application of general turn-taking models, specifically TurnGPT and Voice Activity Projection (VAP), to improve conversational dynamics in HRI. These models are trained on human-human dialogue data using self-supervised learning objectives, without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning.

In this paper, we present a novel method for characterizing and visualizing dynamic behavior, along with four benchmarks to evaluate the morphological performance of the robot. Analysis shows that our ModCube design is desirable for omnidirectional tasks, compared with the configurations widely used by commercial underwater robots. We run real robot experiments in two water tanks to demonstrate the robust control and self-assemble of the proposed system, We also open-source the design and code to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, letter</p></details> |
| **[RoboHorizon: An LLM-Assisted Multi-View World Model for Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06605v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient control in long-horizon robotic manipulation is challenging due to complex representation and policy learning requirements. Model-based visual reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in addressing these challenges but still faces notable limitations, particularly in handling sparse rewards and complex visual features in long-horizon environments. To address these limitations, we propose the Recognize-Sense-Plan-Act (RSPA) pipeline for long-horizon tasks and further introduce RoboHorizon, an LLM-assisted multi-view world model tailored for long-horizon robotic manipulation. In RoboHorizon, pre-trained LLMs generate dense reward structures for multi-stage sub-tasks based on task language instructions, enabling robots to better recognize long-horizon tasks. Keyframe discovery is then integrated into the multi-view masked autoencoder (MAE) architecture to enhance the robot's ability to sense critical task sequences, strengthening its multi-stage perception of long-horizon processes. Leveraging these dense rewards and multi-view representations, a robotic world model is constructed to efficiently plan long-horizon tasks, enabling the robot to reliably act through RL algorithms. Experiments on two representative benchmarks, RLBench and FurnitureBench, show that RoboHorizon outperforms state-of-the-art visual model-based RL methods, achieving a 23.35% improvement in task success rates on RLBench's 4 short-horizon tasks and a 29.23% improvement on 6 long-horizon tasks from RLBench and 3 furniture assembly tasks from FurnitureBench.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Image-to-Force Estimation for Soft Tissue Interaction in Robotic-Assisted Surgery Using Structured Light](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08593v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For Minimally Invasive Surgical (MIS) robots, accurate haptic interaction force feedback is essential for ensuring the safety of interacting with soft tissue. However, most existing MIS robotic systems cannot facilitate direct measurement of the interaction force with hardware sensors due to space limitations. This letter introduces an effective vision-based scheme that utilizes a One-Shot structured light projection with a designed pattern on soft tissue coupled with haptic information processing through a trained image-to-force neural network. The images captured from the endoscopic stereo camera are analyzed to reconstruct high-resolution 3D point clouds for soft tissue deformation. Based on this, a modified PointNet-based force estimation method is proposed, which excels in representing the complex mechanical properties of soft tissue. Numerical force interaction experiments are conducted on three silicon materials with different stiffness. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Dynamic Situational Awareness in Human Robot Teams: An Interview Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08507v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In human-robot teams, human situational awareness is the operator's conscious knowledge of the team's states, actions, plans and their environment. Appropriate human situational awareness is critical to successful human-robot collaboration. In human-robot teaming, it is often assumed that the best and required level of situational awareness is knowing everything at all times. This view is problematic, because what a human needs to know for optimal team performance varies given the dynamic environmental conditions, task context and roles and capabilities of team members. We explore this topic by interviewing 16 participants with active and repeated experience in diverse human-robot teaming applications. Based on analysis of these interviews, we derive a framework explaining the dynamic nature of required situational awareness in human-robot teaming. In addition, we identify a range of factors affecting the dynamic nature of required and actual levels of situational awareness (i.e., dynamic situational awareness), types of situational awareness inefficiencies resulting from gaps between actual and required situational awareness, and their main consequences. We also reveal various strategies, initiated by humans and robots, that assist in maintaining the required situational awareness. Our findings inform the implementation of accurate estimates of dynamic situational awareness and the design of user-adaptive human-robot interfaces. Therefore, this work contributes to the future design of more collaborative and effective human-robot teams.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative and Asynchronous Transformer-based Mission Planning for Heterogeneous Teams of Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06372v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative mission planning for heterogeneous teams of mobile robots presents a unique set of challenges, particularly when operating under communication constraints and limited computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose the Cooperative and Asynchronous Transformer-based Mission Planning (CATMiP) framework, which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to coordinate distributed decision making among agents with diverse sensing, motion, and actuation capabilities, operating under sporadic ad hoc communication. A Class-based Macro-Action Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (CMacDec-POMDP) is also formulated to effectively model asynchronous decision-making for heterogeneous teams of agents. The framework utilizes an asynchronous centralized training and distributed execution scheme that is developed based on the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) architecture. This design allows a single trained model to generalize to larger environments and accommodate varying team sizes and compositions. We evaluate CATMiP in a 2D grid-world simulation environment and compare its performance against planning-based exploration methods. Results demonstrate CATMiP's superior efficiency, scalability, and robustness to communication dropouts, highlighting its potential for real-world heterogeneous mobile robot systems. The code is available at https://github.com/mylad13/CATMiP.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, this work has been submitted to Elsevier for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Sight: Finetuning Generalist Robot Policies with Heterogeneous Sensors via Language Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04693v3)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interacting with the world is a multi-sensory experience: achieving effective general-purpose interaction requires making use of all available modalities -- including vision, touch, and audio -- to fill in gaps from partial observation. For example, when vision is occluded reaching into a bag, a robot should rely on its senses of touch and sound. However, state-of-the-art generalist robot policies are typically trained on large datasets to predict robot actions solely from visual and proprioceptive observations. In this work, we propose FuSe, a novel approach that enables finetuning visuomotor generalist policies on heterogeneous sensor modalities for which large datasets are not readily available by leveraging natural language as a common cross-modal grounding. We combine a multimodal contrastive loss with a sensory-grounded language generation loss to encode high-level semantics. In the context of robot manipulation, we show that FuSe enables performing challenging tasks that require reasoning jointly over modalities such as vision, touch, and sound in a zero-shot setting, such as multimodal prompting, compositional cross-modal prompting, and descriptions of objects it interacts with. We show that the same recipe is applicable to widely different generalist policies, including both diffusion-based generalist policies and large vision-language-action (VLA) models. Extensive experiments in the real world show that FuSeis able to increase success rates by over 20% compared to all considered baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[GestLLM: Advanced Hand Gesture Interpretation via Large Language Models for Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07295v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces GestLLM, an advanced system for human-robot interaction that enables intuitive robot control through hand gestures. Unlike conventional systems, which rely on a limited set of predefined gestures, GestLLM leverages large language models and feature extraction via MediaPipe to interpret a diverse range of gestures. This integration addresses key limitations in existing systems, such as restricted gesture flexibility and the inability to recognize complex or unconventional gestures commonly used in human communication. By combining state-of-the-art feature extraction and language model capabilities, GestLLM achieves performance comparable to leading vision-language models while supporting gestures underrepresented in traditional datasets. For example, this includes gestures from popular culture, such as the ``Vulcan salute" from Star Trek, without any additional pretraining, prompt engineering, etc. This flexibility enhances the naturalness and inclusivity of robot control, making interactions more intuitive and user-friendly. GestLLM provides a significant step forward in gesture-based interaction, enabling robots to understand and respond to a wide variety of hand gestures effectively. This paper outlines its design, implementation, and evaluation, demonstrating its potential applications in advanced human-robot collaboration, assistive robotics, and interactive entertainment.</p></details> |  |

Such classification problems arise in several applications including search-and-rescue and precision agriculture. Specifically, we want to classify the regions of a search environment into interesting and uninteresting as quickly as possible using a team of mobile sensors and mobile charging stations. We develop a data-driven strategy that accommodates the noise in sensed data and the limited energy capacity of the sensors, and generates collision-free motion plans for the team. We propose a bi-level approach, where a high-level planner leverages a multi-armed bandit framework to determine the potential regions of interest for the drones to visit next based on the data collected online. Then, a low-level path planner based on integer programming coordinates the paths for the team to visit the target regions subject to the physical constraints. We characterize several theoretical properties of the proposed approach, including anytime guarantees and task completion time. We show the efficacy of our approach in simulation, and further validate these observations in physical experiments using mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

These tasks are difficult to model, making classical control challenging. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution by enabling the learning of models and control policies directly from data. However, its application to real-world problems is limited by data inefficiency and unsafe exploration. Adaptive hybrid RL methods blend classical control and RL adaptively, combining the strengths of both: structure from control and learning from RL. This has led to improvements in data efficiency and exploration safety. However, their potential for hardware applications remains underexplored, with no evaluations on physical systems to date. Such evaluations are critical to fully assess the practicality and effectiveness of these methods in real-world settings. This work presents an experimental demonstration of the hybrid RL algorithm CHEQ for robotic polishing with variable impedance, a task requiring precise force and velocity tracking. In simulation, we show that variable impedance enhances polishing performance. We compare standalone RL with adaptive hybrid RL, demonstrating that CHEQ achieves effective learning while adhering to safety constraints. On hardware, CHEQ achieves effective polishing behaviour, requiring only eight hours of training and incurring just five failures. These results highlight the potential of adaptive hybrid RL for real-world, contact-rich tasks trained directly on hardware.</p></details> |  |

Its successor, Industry 5.0, envisions humans as collaborators and experts guiding these AI-driven manufacturing solutions. Developing these techniques necessitates algorithms capable of safe, real-time identification of human positions in a scene, particularly their hands, during collaborative assembly. Although substantial efforts have curated datasets for hand segmentation, most focus on residential or commercial domains. Existing datasets targeting industrial settings predominantly rely on synthetic data, which we demonstrate does not effectively transfer to real-world operations. Moreover, these datasets lack uncertainty estimations critical for safe collaboration. Addressing these gaps, we present HAGS: Hand and Glove Segmentation Dataset. This dataset provides challenging examples to build applications toward hand and glove segmentation in industrial human-robot collaboration scenarios as well as assess out-of-distribution images, constructed via green screen augmentations, to determine ML-classifier robustness. We study state-of-the-art, real-time segmentation models to evaluate existing methods.

Current research predominantly evaluates hand segmentation under in-distribution (ID) data, which reflects the training data of deep learning (DL) models. However, this approach fails to address out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios that often arise in real-world human-robot interactions. In this study, we present a novel approach by evaluating the performance of pre-trained DL models under both ID data and more challenging OOD scenarios. To mimic realistic industrial scenarios, we designed a diverse dataset featuring simple and cluttered backgrounds with industrial tools, varying numbers of hands (0 to 4), and hands with and without gloves. For OOD scenarios, we incorporated unique and rare conditions such as finger-crossing gestures and motion blur from fast-moving hands, addressing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. To ensure multiple point of views (PoVs), we utilized both egocentric cameras, mounted on the operator's head, and static cameras to capture RGB images of human-robot interactions. This approach allowed us to account for multiple camera perspectives while also evaluating the performance of models trained on existing egocentric datasets as well as static-camera datasets. For segmentation, we used a deep ensemble model composed of UNet and RefineNet as base learners. Performance evaluation was conducted using segmentation metrics and uncertainty quantification via predictive entropy. Results revealed that models trained on industrial datasets outperformed those trained on non-industrial datasets, highlighting the importance of context-specific training. Although all models struggled with OOD scenarios, those trained on industrial datasets demonstrated significantly better generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Synesthesia: A Sound and Emotion Guided AI Painter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04850v3)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>If a picture paints a thousand words, sound may voice a million. While recent robotic painting and image synthesis methods have achieved progress in generating visuals from text inputs, the translation of sound into images is vastly unexplored. Generally, sound-based interfaces and sonic interactions have the potential to expand accessibility and control for the user and provide a means to convey complex emotions and the dynamic aspects of the real world. In this paper, we propose an approach for using sound and speech to guide a robotic painting process, known here as robot synesthesia. For general sound, we encode the simulated paintings and input sounds into the same latent space. For speech, we decouple speech into its transcribed text and the tone of the speech. Whereas we use the text to control the content, we estimate the emotions from the tone to guide the mood of the painting. Our approach has been fully integrated with FRIDA, a robotic painting framework, adding sound and speech to FRIDA's existing input modalities, such as text and style. In two surveys, participants were able to correctly guess the emotion or natural sound used to generate a given painting more than twice as likely as random chance. On our sound-guided image manipulation and music-guided paintings, we discuss the results qualitatively.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Inductive Learning of Robot Task Knowledge from Raw Data and Online Expert Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07507v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing level of autonomy of robots poses challenges of trust and social acceptance, especially in human-robot interaction scenarios. This requires an interpretable implementation of robotic cognitive capabilities, possibly based on formal methods as logics for the definition of task specifications. However, prior knowledge is often unavailable in complex realistic scenarios. In this paper, we propose an offline algorithm based on inductive logic programming from noisy examples to extract task specifications (i.e., action preconditions, constraints and effects) directly from raw data of few heterogeneous (i.e., not repetitive) robotic executions. Our algorithm leverages on the output of any unsupervised action identification algorithm from video-kinematic recordings. Combining it with the definition of very basic, almost task-agnostic, commonsense concepts about the environment, which contribute to the interpretability of our methodology, we are able to learn logical axioms encoding preconditions of actions, as well as their effects in the event calculus paradigm. Since the quality of learned specifications depends mainly on the accuracy of the action identification algorithm, we also propose an online framework for incremental refinement of task knowledge from user feedback, guaranteeing safe execution. Results in a standard manipulation task and benchmark for user training in the safety-critical surgical robotic scenario, show the robustness, data- and time-efficiency of our methodology, with promising results towards the scalability in more complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Sense of Agency in Assistive Robotics Using Shared Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07462v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sense of agency is one factor that influences people's preferences for robot assistance and a phenomenon from cognitive science that represents the experience of control over one's environment. However, in assistive robotics literature, we often see paradigms that optimize measures like task success and cognitive load, rather than sense of agency. In fact, prior work has found that participants sometimes express a preference for paradigms, such as direct teleoperation, which do not perform well with those other metrics but give more control to the user. In this work, we focus on a subset of assistance paradigms for manipulation called shared autonomy in which the system combines control signals from the user and the automated control. We run a study to evaluate sense of agency and show that higher robot autonomy during assistance leads to improved task performance but a decreased sense of agency, indicating a potential trade-off between task performance and sense of agency. From our findings, we discuss the relation between sense of agency and optimality, and we consider a proxy metric for a component of sense of agency which might enable us to build systems that monitor and maintain sense of agency in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figure, HRI conference</p></details> |

Many depth sensing (or RGB-D) cameras are available on the market and selecting the best one for your application can be challenging. In this work, we tested four stereoscopic RGB-D cameras that sense the distance by using two images from slightly different views. We empirically compared four cameras (Intel RealSense D435, Intel RealSense D455, StereoLabs ZED 2, and Luxonis OAK-D Pro) in three scenarios: (i) planar surface perception, (ii) plastic doll perception, (iii) household object perception (YCB dataset). We recorded and evaluated more than 3,000 RGB-D frames for each camera. For table-top robotics scenarios with distance to objects up to one meter, the best performance is provided by the D435 camera. For longer distances, the other three models perform better, making them more suitable for some mobile robotics applications. OAK-D Pro additionally offers integrated AI modules (e.g., object and human keypoint detection). ZED 2 is not a standalone device and requires a computer with a GPU for depth data acquisition.

| **[Improving Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion Robustness Using Robust Control in Aerial Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07223v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving robustness to uncertainty and rejection of external disturbances represents a significant challenge in aerial robotics. Nonlinear controllers based on Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI), known for their ability in estimating disturbances through measured-filtered data, have been notably used in such applications. Typically, these controllers comprise two cascaded loops: an inner loop employing nonlinear dynamic inversion and an outer loop generating the virtual control inputs via linear controllers. In this paper, a novel methodology is introduced, that combines the advantages of INDI with the robustness of linear structured $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ controllers. A full cascaded architecture is proposed to control the dynamics of a multirotor drone, covering both stabilization and guidance. In particular, low-order $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ controllers are designed for the outer loop by properly structuring the problem and solving it through non-smooth optimization. A comparative analysis is conducted between an existing INDI/PD approach and the proposed INDI/$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ strategy, showing a notable enhancement in the rejection of external disturbances. It is carried out first using MATLAB simulations involving a nonlinear model of a Parrot Bebop quadcopter drone, and then experimentally using a customized quadcopter built by the ENAC team. The results show an improvement of more than 50\% in the rejection of disturbances such as gusts.</p></details> |  |

However, human oversight remains crucial. This study compared two touchless methods for directing mobile robots: voice control and gesture control, to investigate the efficiency of the methods and the preference of users. We tested these methods in two conditions: one in which participants remained stationary and one in which they walked freely alongside the robot. We hypothesized that walking alongside the robot would result in higher intuitiveness ratings and improved task performance, based on the idea that walking promotes spatial alignment and reduces the effort required for mental rotation. In a 2x2 within-subject design, 218 participants guided the quadruped robot Spot along a circuitous route with multiple 90-degree turns using rotate left, rotate right, and walk forward commands. After each trial, participants rated the intuitiveness of the command mapping, while post-experiment interviews were used to gather the participants' preferences. Results showed that voice control combined with walking with Spot was the most favored and intuitive, whereas gesture control while standing caused confusion for left/right commands. Nevertheless, 29% of participants preferred gesture control, citing increased task engagement and visual congruence as reasons. An odometry-based analysis revealed that participants often followed behind Spot, particularly in the gesture control condition, when they were allowed to walk. In conclusion, voice control with walking produced the best outcomes. Improving physical ergonomics and adjusting gesture types could make gesture control more effective.</p></details> |  |

These schemes, even if they assume an inherent simplification of the robot's dynamics, were shown to endow robots with a step-adjustment capability in reaction to small pushes, and, moreover, in the case of uncertain parameters - as unknown payloads - they were shown to be able to provide some practical, albeit limited, robustness. In this work, we provide rigorous certificates of their closed loop stability via a reformulation of the centroidal MPC controller. This is achieved thanks to a systematic procedure inspired by the machinery of adaptive control, together with ideas coming from Control Lyapunov functions. Our reformulation, in addition, provides robustness for a class of unmeasured constant disturbances. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we validated our formulation on a new generation of humanoid robots - the 56.7 kg ergoCub, as well as on a commercially available 21 kg quadruped robot, Aliengo.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional planning methods that rely on domain-specific knowledge and handcrafted rules, LMs generalize from diverse data and adapt to various tasks with minimal tuning, acting as a compressed knowledge base. However, LMs in their standard form face challenges with long-horizon tasks, particularly in partially observable multi-agent settings. We propose an LM-based Long-Horizon Planner for Multi-Agent Robotics (LLaMAR), a cognitive architecture for planning that achieves state-of-the-art results in long-horizon tasks within partially observable environments. LLaMAR employs a plan-act-correct-verify framework, allowing self-correction from action execution feedback without relying on oracles or simulators. Additionally, we present MAP-THOR, a comprehensive test suite encompassing household tasks of varying complexity within the AI2-THOR environment. Experiments show that LLaMAR achieves a 30% higher success rate than other state-of-the-art LM-based multi-agent planners in MAP-THOR and Search \& Rescue tasks.

To address this challenging task, we propose a novel group diffusion model (GDM) based architecture for robots to generate point cloud maps with very limited input information.Inspired from the blind humans' natural capability of imagining or generating mental maps, the proposed method can generate maps without visual perception data or depth data. With additional limited super-sparse spatial positioning data, like the extra contact-based positioning information the blind individuals can obtain, the map generation quality can be improved even more.Experiments on public datasets are conducted, and the results indicate that our method can generate reasonable maps solely based on path data, and produce even more refined maps upon incorporating exiguous LiDAR data.Compared to conventional mapping approaches, our novel method significantly mitigates sensor dependency, enabling the robots to imagine and generate elementary maps without heavy onboard sensory devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Error Awareness Through Human Reactions: Implementation, Evaluation, and Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05723v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective error detection is crucial to prevent task disruption and maintain user trust. Traditional methods often rely on task-specific models or user reporting, which can be inflexible or slow. Recent research suggests social signals, naturally exhibited by users in response to robot errors, can enable more flexible, timely error detection. However, most studies rely on post hoc analysis, leaving their real-time effectiveness uncertain and lacking user-centric evaluation. In this work, we developed a proactive error detection system that combines user behavioral signals (facial action units and speech), user feedback, and error context for automatic error detection. In a study (N = 28), we compared our proactive system to a status quo reactive approach. Results show our system 1) reliably and flexibly detects error, 2) detects errors faster than the reactive approach, and 3) is perceived more favorably by users than the reactive one. We discuss recommendations for enabling robot error awareness in future HRI systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Motion Tracks: A Unified Representation for Human-Robot Transfer in Few-Shot Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06994v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching robots to autonomously complete everyday tasks remains a challenge. Imitation Learning (IL) is a powerful approach that imbues robots with skills via demonstrations, but is limited by the labor-intensive process of collecting teleoperated robot data. Human videos offer a scalable alternative, but it remains difficult to directly train IL policies from them due to the lack of robot action labels. To address this, we propose to represent actions as short-horizon 2D trajectories on an image. These actions, or motion tracks, capture the predicted direction of motion for either human hands or robot end-effectors. We instantiate an IL policy called Motion Track Policy (MT-pi) which receives image observations and outputs motion tracks as actions. By leveraging this unified, cross-embodiment action space, MT-pi completes tasks with high success given just minutes of human video and limited additional robot demonstrations. At test time, we predict motion tracks from two camera views, recovering 6DoF trajectories via multi-view synthesis. MT-pi achieves an average success rate of 86.5% across 4 real-world tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art IL baselines which do not leverage human data or our action space by 40%, and generalizes to scenarios seen only in human videos. Code and videos are available on our website https://portal-cornell.github.io/motion_track_policy/.</p></details> |  |

The system integrates a vision module for detecting ingredient bottles and reading labels, a speech-to-text module for interpreting user commands, and a language model to generate task-specific robotic instructions. Force Torque (FT) sensors are employed to precisely measure the quantity of liquid poured, ensuring accuracy in ingredient proportions during the mixing process. The system architecture includes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module for accessing and adapting recipes, an anomaly detection mechanism to address ingredient availability issues, and bimanual robotic arms for dexterous manipulation. Experimental evaluations demonstrated a high success rate across system components, with the speech-to-text module achieving a 93% success rate in noisy environments, the vision module attaining a 91% success rate in object and label detection in cluttered environment, the anomaly module successfully identified 95% of discrepancies between detected ingredients and recipe requirements, and the system achieved an overall success rate of 100% in preparing cocktails, from recipe formulation to action generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/ACM HRI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Toward a Universal Concept of Artificial Personality: Implementing Robotic Personality in a Kinova Arm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06867v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fundamental role of personality in shaping interactions is increasingly being exploited in robotics. A carefully designed robotic personality has been shown to improve several key aspects of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). However, the fragmentation and rigidity of existing approaches reveal even greater challenges when applied to non-humanoid robots. On one hand, the state of the art is very dispersed; on the other hand, Industry 4.0 is moving towards a future where humans and industrial robots are going to coexist. In this context, the proper design of a robotic personality can lead to more successful interactions. This research takes a first step in that direction by integrating a comprehensive cognitive architecture built upon the definition of robotic personality - validated on humanoid robots - into a robotic Kinova Jaco2 arm. The robot personality is defined through the cognitive architecture as a vector in the three-dimensional space encompassing Conscientiousness, Extroversion, and Agreeableness, affecting how actions are executed, the action selection process, and the internal reaction to environmental stimuli. Our main objective is to determine whether users perceive distinct personalities in the robot, regardless of its shape, and to understand the role language plays in shaping these perceptions. To achieve this, we conducted a user study comprising 144 sessions of a collaborative game between a Kinova Jaco2 arm and participants, where the robot's behavior was influenced by its assigned personality. Furthermore, we compared two conditions: in the first, the robot communicated solely through gestures and action choices, while in the second, it also utilized verbal interaction.</p></details> |  |

This is true not only for model-based controllers, but also for model-free, real-time control methods such as extremum seeking control (ESC). In this paper, we propose a unicycle-based ESC design applicable to differential wheeled robots that: (1) is very simple design, based on one simple control-affine law, and without state integrators; (2) attenuates oscillations known to persist in ESC designs (i.e., fully stop at the source); and (3) operates in a model-free, real-time setting, tolerating environmental/sensor noise. We provide simulation and real-world robotic experimental results for fixed and moving light source seeking by a differential wheeled robot using our proposed design. Results indicate clear advantages of our proposed design when compared to the literature, including attenuation of undesired oscillations, improved convergence speed, and better handling of noise.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores developing a robotic finger with similar multi-stiffness characteristics. Specifically, we propose using a lattice configuration, parameterized by voxel size and unit cell geometry, to optimize and achieve fine-tuned stiffness properties with high granularity. A significant advantage of this approach is the feasibility of 3D printing the designs in a single process, eliminating the need for manual assembly of elements with differing stiffness. Based on this method, we present a novel, human-like finger, and a soft gripper. We integrate the latter with a rigid manipulator and demonstrate the effectiveness in pick and place tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Splat-Nav: Safe Real-Time Robot Navigation in Gaussian Splatting Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02751v3)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Splat-Nav, a real-time robot navigation pipeline for Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) scenes, a powerful new 3D scene representation. Splat-Nav consists of two components: 1) Splat-Plan, a safe planning module, and 2) Splat-Loc, a robust vision-based pose estimation module. Splat-Plan builds a safe-by-construction polytope corridor through the map based on mathematically rigorous collision constraints and then constructs a B\'ezier curve trajectory through this corridor. Splat-Loc provides real-time recursive state estimates given only an RGB feed from an on-board camera, leveraging the point-cloud representation inherent in GSplat scenes. Working together, these modules give robots the ability to recursively re-plan smooth and safe trajectories to goal locations. Goals can be specified with position coordinates, or with language commands by using a semantic GSplat. We demonstrate improved safety compared to point cloud-based methods in extensive simulation experiments. In a total of 126 hardware flights, we demonstrate equivalent safety and speed compared to motion capture and visual odometry, but without a manual frame alignment required by those methods. We show online re-planning at more than 2 Hz and pose estimation at about 25 Hz, an order of magnitude faster than Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based navigation methods, thereby enabling real-time navigation. We provide experiment videos on our project page at https://chengine.github.io/splatnav/. Our codebase and ROS nodes can be found at https://github.com/chengine/splatnav.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Automate This? Exploring the Connection between Time Use, Well-being and Robot Automation Across Social Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06348v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the motivations underlying the human inclination to automate tasks is vital to developing truly helpful robots integrated into daily life. Accordingly, we ask: are individuals more inclined to automate chores based on the time they consume or the feelings experienced while performing them? This study explores these preferences and whether they vary across different social groups (i.e., gender category and income level). Leveraging data from the BEHAVIOR-1K dataset, the American Time-Use Survey, and the American Time-Use Survey Well-Being Module, we investigate the relationship between the desire for automation, time spent on daily activities, and their associated feelings - Happiness, Meaningfulness, Sadness, Painfulness, Stressfulness, or Tiredness. Our key findings show that, despite common assumptions, time spent does not strongly relate to the desire for automation for the general population. For the feelings analyzed, only happiness and pain are key indicators. Significant differences by gender and economic level also emerged: Women prefer to automate stressful activities, whereas men prefer to automate those that make them unhappy; mid-income individuals prioritize automating less enjoyable and meaningful activities, while low and high-income show no significant correlations. We hope our research helps motivate technologies to develop robots that match the priorities of potential users, moving domestic robotics toward more socially relevant solutions. We open-source all the data, including an online tool that enables the community to replicate our analysis and explore additional trends at https://hri1260.github.io/why-automate-this.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

The challenge lies in finding the most adapted strategy for the control interface to effectively map user's motions in a low-dimensional space to complex robotic assistive devices, such as prostheses, supernumerary limbs, up to remote robotic avatars. The goal is a system which integrates the human and the robotic parts into a unique system, moving so as to reach the targets decided by the human while autonomously reducing the user's effort and discomfort. We present a framework to control general multi DoFs assistive systems, which translates user-performed compensatory motions into the necessary robot commands for reaching targets while canceling or reducing compensation. The framework extends to prostheses of any number of DoF up to full robotic avatars, regarded here as a sort of whole-body prosthesis of the person who sees the robot as an artificial extension of their own body without a physical link but with a sensory-motor integration. We have validated and applied this control strategy through tests encompassing simulated scenarios and real-world trials involving a virtual twin of the robotic parts (prosthesis and robot) and a physical humanoid avatar.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), under review since October 2024, 16 pages, 30 figures</p></details> |
| **[Robots in Family Routines: Development of and Initial Insights from the Family-Robot Routines Inventory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11136v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in areas such as the personalization of robots, sustaining adoption of robots for long-term use in families remains a challenge. Recent studies have identified integrating robots into families' routines and rituals as a promising approach to support long-term adoption. However, few studies explored the integration of robots into family routines and there is a gap in systematic measures to capture family preferences for robot integration. Building upon existing routine inventories, we developed Family-Robot Routines Inventory (FRRI), with 24 family routines and 24 child routine items, to capture parents' attitudes toward and expectations from the integration of robotic technology into their family routines. Using this inventory, we collected data from 150 parents through an online survey. Our analysis indicates that parents had varying perceptions for the utility of integrating robots into their routines. For example, parents found robot integration to be more helpful in children's individual routines, than to the collective routines of their families. We discuss the design implications of these preliminary findings, and how they may serve as a first step toward understanding the diverse challenges and demands of designing and integrating household robots for families.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Use of Robots for Diary Studies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04860v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As interest in studying in-the-wild human-robot interaction grows, there is a need for methods to collect data over time and in naturalistic or potentially private environments. HRI researchers have increasingly used the diary method for these studies, asking study participants to self-administer a structured data collection instrument, i.e., a diary, over a period of time. Although the diary method offers a unique window into settings that researchers may not have access to, they also lack the interactivity and probing that interview-based methods offer. In this paper, we explore a novel data collection method in which a robot plays the role of an interactive diary. We developed the Diary Robot system and performed in-home deployments for a week to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach. Using traditional text-based and audio-based diaries as benchmarks, we found that robots are able to effectively elicit the intended information. We reflect on our findings, and describe scenarios where the utilization of robots in diary studies as a data collection instrument may be especially applicable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 20th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human Robot Interaction (HRI 2025)</p></details> |

However, deeper areas, such as lunar caves and craters, require the mobility of legged robots. To do so, appropriate end effectors must be designed to enable climbing and walking on the granular surface of the Moon. This paper investigates the behavior of an underactuated soft gripper on deformable granular material when a legged robot is walking in soft soil. A modular test bench and a simulation model were developed to observe the gripper sinkage behavior under load. The gripper uses tendon-driven fingers to match its target shape and grasp on the target surface using multiple micro-spines. The sinkage of the gripper in silica sand was measured by comparing the axial displacement of the gripper with the nominal load of the robot mass. Multiple experiments were performed to observe the sinkage of the gripper over a range of slope angles. A simulation model accounting for the degrees of compliance of the gripper fingers was created using Altair MotionSolve software and coupled to Altair EDEM to compute the gripper interaction with particles utilizing the discrete element method. After validation of the model, complementary simulations using Lunar gravity and a regolith particle model were performed. The results show that a satisfactory gripper model with accurate freedom of motion can be created in simulation using the Altair simulation packages and expected sinkage under load in a particle-filled environment can be estimated using this model. By computing the sinkage of the end effector of legged robots, the results can be directly integrated into the motion control algorithm and improve the accuracy of mobility in a granular material environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 21st International and 12th Asia-Pacific Regional Conference of the ISTVS</p></details> |

Internet of Robotics Things (IoRT) is a concept that has been recently introduced to describe the integration of robotics technologies in IoT scenarios.

However, when working in an open, dynamic, and unstructured home environment, service robots still face challenges such as low intelligence for task execution and poor long-term autonomy (LTA), which has limited their deployment. As the basis of robotic task execution, environment modeling has attracted significant attention. This integrates core technologies such as environment perception, understanding, and representation to accurately recognize environmental information. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of environmental modeling from a new task-executionoriented perspective. In particular, guided by the requirements of robots in performing domestic service tasks in the home environment, we systematically review the progress that has been made in task-execution-oriented environmental modeling in four respects: 1) localization, 2) navigation, 3) manipulation, and 4) LTA.

| **[Towards Probabilistic Inference of Human Motor Intentions by Assistive Mobile Robots Controlled via a Brain-Computer Interface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05610v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assistive mobile robots are a transformative technology that helps persons with disabilities regain the ability to move freely. Although autonomous wheelchairs significantly reduce user effort, they still require human input to allow users to maintain control and adapt to changing environments. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) stands out as a highly user-friendly option that does not require physical movement. Current BCI systems can understand whether users want to accelerate or decelerate, but they implement these changes in discrete speed steps rather than allowing for smooth, continuous velocity adjustments. This limitation prevents the systems from mimicking the natural, fluid speed changes seen in human self-paced motion. The authors aim to address this limitation by redesigning the perception-action cycle in a BCI controlled robotic system: improving how the robotic agent interprets the user's motion intentions (world state) and implementing these actions in a way that better reflects natural physical properties of motion, such as inertia and damping. The scope of this paper focuses on the perception aspect. We asked and answered a normative question "what computation should the robotic agent carry out to optimally perceive incomplete or noisy sensory observations?" Empirical EEG data were collected, and probabilistic representation that served as world state distributions were learned and evaluated in a Generative Adversarial Network framework. The ROS framework was established that connected with a Gazebo environment containing a digital twin of an indoor space and a virtual model of a robotic wheelchair. Signal processing and statistical analyses were implemented to identity the most discriminative features in the spatial-spectral-temporal dimensions, which are then used to construct the world model for the robotic agent to interpret user motion intentions as a Bayesian observer.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Its whole-body dexterity allows the robot to utilize its entire body surface for manipulation, such as leveraging multiple contact points or navigating constrained spaces. Meanwhile, whole-body vision uses a camera system distributed over the robot's surface to provide comprehensive, multi-perspective visual feedback of its own and the environment's state. At its core, RoboPanoptes uses a whole-body visuomotor policy that learns complex manipulation skills directly from human demonstrations, efficiently aggregating information from the distributed cameras while maintaining resilience to sensor failures. Together, these design aspects unlock new capabilities and tasks, allowing RoboPanoptes to unbox in narrow spaces, sweep multiple or oversized objects, and succeed in multi-step stowing in cluttered environments, outperforming baselines in adaptability and efficiency.

We propose an Improved Q-learning (IQL) framework that enhances standard Q-learning in two significant ways. First, we introduce the Path Adaptive Collaborative Optimization (PACO) algorithm to optimize Q-table initialization, providing better initial estimates and accelerating learning. Second, we incorporate a Utility-Controlled Heuristic (UCH) mechanism with dynamically tuned parameters to optimize the reward function, enhancing the algorithm's accuracy and effectiveness in path-planning tasks. Extensive experiments in three different raster grid environments validate the superior performance of our IQL framework. The results demonstrate that our IQL algorithm outperforms existing methods, including FIQL, PP-QL-based CPP, DFQL, and QMABC algorithms, in terms of path-planning capabilities.</p></details> | 25 pages, 20 figures |
| **[Occupation-aware planning method for robotic monitoring missions in dynamic environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00846v2)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a method for robotic monitoring missions in the presence of moving obstacles. Although the scenario map is known, the robot lacks information about the movement of dynamic obstacles during the monitoring mission. Numerous local planners have been developed in recent years for navigating highly dynamic environments. However, the absence of a global planner for these environments can result in unavoidable collisions or the inability to successfully complete missions in densely populated areas, such as a scenario monitoring in our case. This work addresses the development and evaluation of a global planner, $MADA$ (Monitoring Avoiding Dynamic Areas), aimed at enhancing the deployment of robots in such challenging conditions. The robot plans and executes the mission using the proposed two-step approach. The first step involves selecting the observation goal based on the environment's distribution and estimated monitoring costs. In the second step, the robot identifies areas with moving obstacles and obtains paths avoiding densely occupied dynamic regions based on their occupation. Quantitative and qualitative results based on simulations and on real-world experimentation, confirm that the proposed method allows the robot to effectively monitor most of the environment while avoiding densely occupied dynamic areas.</p></details> |  |

AI's role in enhancing robotic manipulators - key drivers in the Fourth Industrial Revolution - is rapidly leading to significant innovations in smart manufacturing. The objective of this article is to frame these innovations in practical force-controlled applications - e.g. deburring, polishing, and assembly tasks like peg-in-hole (PiH) - highlighting their necessity for maintaining high-quality production standards. By reporting on recent AI-based methodologies, this article contrasts them and identifies current challenges to be addressed in future research. The analysis concludes with a perspective on future research directions, emphasizing the need for common performance metrics to validate AI techniques, integration of various enhancements for performance optimization, and the importance of validating them in relevant scenarios.

These VSN models are typically tested in those virtual environments where they are trained, mainly using reinforcement learning based approaches. Therefore, we do not yet have an in-depth analysis of how these models would behave in the real world. In this work, we propose a new solution to integrate VSN models into real robots, so that we have true embodied agents. We also release a novel ROS-based framework for VSN, ROS4VSN, so that any VSN-model can be easily deployed in any ROS-compatible robot and tested in a real setting. Our experiments with two different robots, where we have embedded two state-of-the-art VSN agents, confirm that there is a noticeable performance difference of these VSN solutions when tested in real-world and simulation environments. We hope that this research will endeavor to provide a foundation for addressing this consequential issue, with the ultimate aim of advancing the performance and efficiency of embodied agents within authentic real-world scenarios. Code to reproduce all our experiments can be found at https://github.com/gramuah/ros4vsn.</p></details> |  |

However, in entertainment applications, the design and control of these robots face additional challenges in appealing to human audiences. This work aims to unify expressive, artist-directed motions and robust dynamic mobility for legged robots. To this end, we introduce a new bipedal robot, designed with a focus on character-driven mechanical features. We present a reinforcement learning-based control architecture to robustly execute artistic motions conditioned on command signals. During runtime, these command signals are generated by an animation engine which composes and blends between multiple animation sources. Finally, an intuitive operator interface enables real-time show performances with the robot. The complete system results in a believable robotic character, and paves the way for enhanced human-robot engagement in various contexts, in entertainment robotics and beyond.</p></details> |  |

We explore teleoperating a robot arm through motion-capture (MoCap) of the human operator's arm with the assistance of augmented reality (AR) visualisations. We investigate how AR helps teleoperation by visualising a virtual reference of the human arm alongside the robot arm to help users understand the movement mapping.

| **[OfficeMate: Pilot Evaluation of an Office Assistant Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05141v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Office Assistant Robots (OARs) offer a promising solution to proactively provide in-situ support to enhance employee well-being and productivity in office spaces. We introduce OfficeMate, a social OAR designed to assist with practical tasks, foster social interaction, and promote health and well-being. Through a pilot evaluation with seven participants in an office environment, we found that users see potential in OARs for reducing stress and promoting healthy habits and value the robot's ability to provide companionship and physical activity reminders in the office space. However, concerns regarding privacy, communication, and the robot's interaction timing were also raised. The feedback highlights the need to carefully consider the robot's appearance and behaviour to ensure it enhances user experience and aligns with office social norms. We believe these insights will better inform the development of adaptive, intelligent OAR systems for future office space integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, accepted to HRI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing the Power of Vibration Motors to Develop Miniature Untethered Robotic Fishes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05107v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Miniature underwater robots play a crucial role in the exploration and development of marine resources, particularly in confined spaces and high-pressure deep-sea environments. This study presents the design, optimization, and performance of a miniature robotic fish, powered by the oscillation of bio-inspired fins. These fins feature a rigid-flexible hybrid structure and use an eccentric rotating mass (ERM) vibration motor as the excitation source to generate high-frequency unidirectional oscillations that induce acoustic streaming for propulsion. The drive mechanism, powered by miniature ERM vibration motors, eliminates the need for complex mechanical drive systems, enabling complete isolation of the entire drive system from the external environment and facilitating the miniaturization of the robotic fish. A compact, untethered robotic fish, measuring 85*60*45 mm^3, is equipped with three bio-inspired fins located at the pectoral and caudal positions. Experimental results demonstrate that the robotic fish achieves a maximum forward swimming speed of 1.36 body lengths (BL) per second powered by all fins and minimum turning radius of 0.6 BL when powered by a single fin. These results underscore the significance of employing the ERM vibration motor in advancing the development of highly maneuverable, miniature untethered underwater robots for various marine exploration tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Unlike traditional fixed-base handovers, this task requires a mobile robot to reliably receive objects in a large workspace enabled by its mobility. Our key insight is that generalizable handover skills can be developed in simulators using high-quality synthetic data, without the need for real-world demonstrations. To achieve this, we propose a scalable pipeline for generating diverse synthetic full-body human motion data, an automated method for creating safe and imitation-friendly demonstrations, and an efficient 4D imitation learning method for distilling large-scale demonstrations into closed-loop policies with base-arm coordination. Experimental evaluations in both simulators and the real world show significant improvements (at least +15% success rate) over baseline methods in all cases. Experiments also validate that large-scale and diverse synthetic data greatly enhances robot learning, highlighting our scalable framework.</p></details> |  |

Language interfaces, particularly those powered by Large Language Models (LLM) and Vision Language Models (VLM), hold significant promise in this context, as they can interpret visual scenes and correlate them with semantic information. However, such interfaces are also known for their hallucinated predictions. In addition, language instructions provided by humans can also be ambiguous and lack precise details about specific locations, objects, or actions, exacerbating the hallucination issue. In this work, we introduce Seeing with Partial Certainty (SwPC) - a framework designed to measure and align uncertainty in VLM-based place recognition, enabling the model to recognize when it lacks confidence and seek assistance when necessary. This framework is built on the theory of conformal prediction to provide statistical guarantees on place recognition while minimizing requests for human help in complex indoor environment settings. Through experiments on the widely used richly-annotated scene dataset Matterport3D, we show that SwPC significantly increases the success rate and decreases the amount of human intervention required relative to the prior art. SwPC can be utilized with any VLMs directly without requiring model fine-tuning, offering a promising, lightweight approach to uncertainty modeling that complements and scales alongside the expanding capabilities of foundational models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 Figures |
| **[What Drives You to Interact?: The Role of User Motivation for a Robot in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04929v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we aim to understand how user motivation shapes human-robot interaction (HRI) in the wild. To explore this, we conducted a field study by deploying a fully autonomous conversational robot in a shopping mall over two days. Through sequential video analysis, we identified five patterns of interaction fluency (Smooth, Awkward, Active, Messy, and Quiet), four types of user motivation for interacting with the robot (Function, Experiment, Curiosity, and Education), and user positioning towards the robot. We further analyzed how these motivations and positioning influence interaction fluency. Our findings suggest that incorporating users' motivation types into the design of robot behavior can enhance interaction fluency, engagement, and user satisfaction in real-world HRI scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Constraints as Rewards: Reinforcement Learning for Robots without Reward Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04228v2)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has become an essential algorithm for generating complex robotic behaviors. However, to learn such behaviors, it is necessary to design a reward function that describes the task, which often consists of multiple objectives that needs to be balanced. This tuning process is known as reward engineering and typically involves extensive trial-and-error. In this paper, to avoid this trial-and-error process, we propose the concept of Constraints as Rewards (CaR). CaR formulates the task objective using multiple constraint functions instead of a reward function and solves a reinforcement learning problem with constraints using the Lagrangian-method. By adopting this approach, different objectives are automatically balanced, because Lagrange multipliers serves as the weights among the objectives. In addition, we will demonstrate that constraints, expressed as inequalities, provide an intuitive interpretation of the optimization target designed for the task. We apply the proposed method to the standing-up motion generation task of a six-wheeled-telescopic-legged robot and demonstrate that the proposed method successfully acquires the target behavior, even though it is challenging to learn with manually designed reward functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[TCAFF: Temporal Consistency for Robot Frame Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05210v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of collaborative robotics, the ability to communicate spatial information like planned trajectories and shared environment information is crucial. When no global position information is available (e.g., indoor or GPS-denied environments), agents must align their coordinate frames before shared spatial information can be properly expressed and interpreted. Coordinate frame alignment is particularly difficult when robots have no initial alignment and are affected by odometry drift. To this end, we develop a novel multiple hypothesis algorithm, called TCAFF, for aligning the coordinate frames of neighboring robots. TCAFF considers potential alignments from associating sparse open-set object maps and leverages temporal consistency to determine an initial alignment and correct for drift, all without any initial knowledge of neighboring robot poses. We demonstrate TCAFF being used for frame alignment in a collaborative object tracking application on a team of four robots tracking six pedestrians and show that TCAFF enables robots to achieve a tracking accuracy similar to that of a system with ground truth localization. The code and hardware dataset are available at https://github.com/mit-acl/tcaff.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |
