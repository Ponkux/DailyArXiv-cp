| **[TwinOR: Photorealistic Digital Twins of Dynamic Operating Rooms for Embodied AI Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07412v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing embodied AI for intelligent surgical systems requires safe, controllable environments for continual learning and evaluation. However, safety regulations and operational constraints in operating rooms (ORs) limit embodied agents from freely perceiving and interacting in realistic settings. Digital twins provide high-fidelity, risk-free environments for exploration and training. How we may create photorealistic and dynamic digital representations of ORs that capture relevant spatial, visual, and behavioral complexity remains unclear. We introduce TwinOR, a framework for constructing photorealistic, dynamic digital twins of ORs for embodied AI research. The system reconstructs static geometry from pre-scan videos and continuously models human and equipment motion through multi-view perception of OR activities. The static and dynamic components are fused into an immersive 3D environment that supports controllable simulation and embodied exploration. The proposed framework reconstructs complete OR geometry with centimeter level accuracy while preserving dynamic interaction across surgical workflows, enabling realistic renderings and a virtual playground for embodied AI systems. In our experiments, TwinOR simulates stereo and monocular sensor streams for geometry understanding and visual localization tasks. Models such as FoundationStereo and ORB-SLAM3 on TwinOR-synthesized data achieve performance within their reported accuracy on real indoor datasets, demonstrating that TwinOR provides sensor-level realism sufficient for perception and localization challenges. By establishing a real-to-sim pipeline for constructing dynamic, photorealistic digital twins of OR environments, TwinOR enables the safe, scalable, and data-efficient development and benchmarking of embodied AI, ultimately accelerating the deployment of embodied AI from sim-to-real.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Do VLAs Effectively Inherit from VLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06619v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models hold the promise to attain generalizable embodied control. To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement this diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and compare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we investigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing, co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions. Through systematic evaluation, our work not only demonstrates the critical importance of preserving VLM priors for the generalization of VLA but also establishes guidelines for future research in developing truly generalizable embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[10 Open Challenges Steering the Future of Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05936v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their ability of follow natural language instructions, vision-language-action (VLA) models are increasingly prevalent in the embodied AI arena, following the widespread success of their precursors -- LLMs and VLMs. In this paper, we discuss 10 principal milestones in the ongoing development of VLA models -- multimodality, reasoning, data, evaluation, cross-robot action generalization, efficiency, whole-body coordination, safety, agents, and coordination with humans. Furthermore, we discuss the emerging trends of using spatial understanding, modeling world dynamics, post training, and data synthesis -- all aiming to reach these milestones. Through these discussions, we hope to bring attention to the research avenues that may accelerate the development of VLA models into wider acceptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 (Senior Track)</p></details> |
| **[psiUnity: A Platform for Multimodal Data-Driven XR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05304v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extended reality (XR) research increasingly relies on the ability to stream and synchronize multimodal data between headsets and immersive applications for data-driven interaction and experimentation. However, developers face a critical gap: the Platform for Situated Intelligence (psi), which excels at deterministic temporal alignment and multimodal data management, has been largely inaccessible to the dominant Unity/MRTK ecosystem used for HoloLens development. We introduce psiUnity, an open-source C# integration that bridges psi's .NET libraries with Unity 2022.3 and MRTK3 for HoloLens 2. psiUnity enables bidirectional, real-time streaming of head pose, hand tracking, gaze, IMU, audio, and depth sensor data (AHAT and long-throw) with microsecond-level temporal precision, allowing Unity applications to both consume and produce synchronized multimodal data streams. By embedding psi's native serialization, logging, and temporal coordination directly within Unity's architecture, psiUnity extends psi beyond its previous StereoKit limitations and empowers the HRI, HCI, and embodied-AI communities to develop reproducible, data-driven XR interactions and experiments within the familiar Unity environment. The integration is available at https://github.com/sailgt/psiUnity.</p></details> |  |
| **[iFlyBot-VLM Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04976v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce iFlyBot-VLM, a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (VLM) used to improve the domain of Embodied Intelligence. The central objective of iFlyBot-VLM is to bridge the cross-modal semantic gap between high-dimensional environmental perception and low-level robotic motion control. To this end, the model abstracts complex visual and spatial information into a body-agnostic and transferable Operational Language, thereby enabling seamless perception-action closed-loop coordination across diverse robotic platforms. The architecture of iFlyBot-VLM is systematically designed to realize four key functional capabilities essential for embodied intelligence: 1) Spatial Understanding and Metric Reasoning; 2) Interactive Target Grounding; 3) Action Abstraction and Control Parameter Generation; 4) Task Planning and Skill Sequencing. We envision iFlyBot-VLM as a scalable and generalizable foundation model for embodied AI, facilitating the progression from specialized task-oriented systems toward generalist, cognitively capable agents. We conducted evaluations on 10 current mainstream embodied intelligence-related VLM benchmark datasets, such as Blink and Where2Place, and achieved optimal performance while preserving the model's general capabilities. We will publicly release both the training data and model weights to foster further research and development in the field of Embodied Intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Action Deviation-Aware Inference for Low-Latency Wireless Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02851v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML with computational resources in mobile, edge, and cloud connected over hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: a lightweight on-device model locally generates drafts while a more capable remote target model on a server verifies and corrects them in parallel with speculative sampling, thus resulting in lower latency without compromising accuracy. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each generated action depends on observation updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference (ADAHI), wherein drafts are selectively transmitted and verified based on action deviation, which has a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model. By invoking server operation only when necessary, communication and computational overhead can be reduced while accuracy gain from speculative sampling is preserved. Experiments on our testbed show that ADAHI reduces transmission and server operations by approximately 40%, lowers end-to-end latency by 39.2%, and attains up to 97.2% of the task-success rate of baseline that invokes speculative sampling for every draft embedding vector.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysCorr: Dual-Reward DPO for Physics-Constrained Text-to-Video Generation with Automated Preference Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03997v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics, incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaRF: Enhancing Multi-View Consistency in Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03992v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically, CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization. Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively. Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and autonomous perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROSBag MCP Server: Analyzing Robot Data with LLMs for Agentic Embodied AI Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03497v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models. The code is available with a permissive license at https://github.com/binabik-ai/mcp-rosbags.</p></details> |  |
| **[EQ-Negotiator: Dynamic Emotional Personas Empower Small Language Models for Edge-Deployable Credit Negotiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03370v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in automated negotiation has set a high performance benchmark, but their computational cost and data privacy requirements render them unsuitable for many privacy-sensitive, on-device applications such as mobile assistants, embodied AI agents or private client interactions. While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative, they suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing emotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This paper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability gap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates game theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional states online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs with the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating conflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent simulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial debtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show that a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its size. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles to dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints. Besides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw model scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation, paving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators that can operate on the edge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02912v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), which uses the agent's own policy to simulate future states. A Message Generation Network (MGN) then compresses this plan into a message. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems, while scaling environmental complexity. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

| **[Learning Interactive World Model for Object-Centric Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02225v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents that understand objects and their interactions can learn policies that are more robust and transferable. However, most object-centric RL methods factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular interaction learning is crucial for robust control.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[URDF-Anything: Constructing Articulated Objects with 3D Multimodal Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00940v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing accurate digital twins of articulated objects is essential for robotic simulation training and embodied AI world model building, yet historically requires painstaking manual modeling or multi-stage pipelines. In this work, we propose \textbf{URDF-Anything}, an end-to-end automatic reconstruction framework based on a 3D multimodal large language model (MLLM). URDF-Anything utilizes an autoregressive prediction framework based on point-cloud and text multimodal input to jointly optimize geometric segmentation and kinematic parameter prediction. It implements a specialized $[SEG]$ token mechanism that interacts directly with point cloud features, enabling fine-grained part-level segmentation while maintaining consistency with the kinematic parameter predictions. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches regarding geometric segmentation (mIoU 17\% improvement), kinematic parameter prediction (average error reduction of 29\%), and physical executability (surpassing baselines by 50\%). Notably, our method exhibits excellent generalization ability, performing well even on objects outside the training set. This work provides an efficient solution for constructing digital twins for robotic simulation, significantly enhancing the sim-to-real transfer capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Spatial Reasoning in the Large Model Era: A Survey and Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25760v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However, systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space. We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated information about this survey, codes and implementation of the open benchmarks can be found at https://github.com/zhengxuJosh/Awesome-Spatial-Reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Modal Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Spatial Reasoning-Based Visual Grounding in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27033v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual reasoning, particularly spatial reasoning, is a challenging cognitive task that requires understanding object relationships and their interactions within complex environments, especially in robotics domain. Existing vision_language models (VLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning due to their implicit, correlation-driven reasoning and reliance solely on images. We propose a novel neuro_symbolic framework that integrates both panoramic-image and 3D point cloud information, combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning to explicitly model spatial and logical relationships. Our framework consists of a perception module for detecting entities and extracting attributes, and a reasoning module that constructs a structured scene graph to support precise, interpretable queries. Evaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, our approach demonstrates superior performance and reliability in crowded, human_built environments while maintaining a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[PoseDiff: A Unified Diffusion Model Bridging Robot Pose Estimation and Video-to-Action Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24591v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI. The video visualization results can be found on the project page: https://haozhuo-zhang.github.io/PoseDiff-project-page/.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The experimental setup and metrics lacks rigor, affecting the fairness of the comparisons</p></details> |
| **[SynHLMA:Synthesizing Hand Language Manipulation for Articulated Object with Discrete Human Object Interaction Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25268v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating hand grasps with language instructions is a widely studied topic that benefits from embodied AI and VR/AR applications. While transferring into hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[SceneWeaver: All-in-One 3D Scene Synthesis with an Extensible and Self-Reflective Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20414v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

| **[Two-Steps Diffusion Policy for Robotic Manipulation via Genetic Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21991v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, such as diffusion policy, have achieved state-of-the-art results in robotic manipulation by imitating expert demonstrations. While diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and video generation, many of their inference strategies have been directly transferred to control domains without adaptation. In this work, we show that by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied AI tasks -- particularly structured, low-dimensional nature of action distributions -- diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as 5 neural function evaluations (NFE). Building on this insight, we propose a population-based sampling strategy, genetic denoising, which enhances both performance and stability by selecting denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk. Our method solves challenging tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. We evaluate our approach across 14 robotic manipulation tasks from D4RL and Robomimic, spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets. In over 2 million evaluations, our method consistently outperforms standard diffusion-based policies, achieving up to 20\% performance gains with significantly fewer inference steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figure, 2 tables, accepted at Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[MEReQ: Max-Ent Residual-Q Inverse RL for Sample-Efficient Alignment from Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16258v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning robot behavior with human preferences is crucial for deploying embodied AI agents in human-centered environments. A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmbodiedBrain: Expanding Performance Boundaries of Task Planning for Embodied Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20578v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model (GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency. For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks, highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data, model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at https://zterobot.github.io/EmbodiedBrain.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05341v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://directlayout.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Seed3D 1.0: From Images to High-Fidelity Simulation-Ready 3D Assets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19944v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing embodied AI agents requires scalable training environments that balance content diversity with physics accuracy. World simulators provide such environments but face distinct limitations: video-based methods generate diverse content but lack real-time physics feedback for interactive learning, while physics-based engines provide accurate dynamics but face scalability limitations from costly manual asset creation. We present Seed3D 1.0, a foundation model that generates simulation-ready 3D assets from single images, addressing the scalability challenge while maintaining physics rigor. Unlike existing 3D generation models, our system produces assets with accurate geometry, well-aligned textures, and realistic physically-based materials. These assets can be directly integrated into physics engines with minimal configuration, enabling deployment in robotic manipulation and simulation training.

They also serve as the foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project and benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/MV-RoboBench</p></details> |

A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned from limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural network-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that paradoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper introduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization. Specifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it transforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal calibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii) it reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization problem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments. Extensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation tasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in generalization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |

While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://faceong.github.io/VIKI-R/</p></details> |
| **[3D Audio-Visual Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02236v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing the sounding objects in scenes is a longstanding objective in embodied AI, with diverse applications in robotics and AR/VR/MR. To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been proposed as a language guided generalized control framework for real robots. However, their deployment has been limited to conventional serial link manipulators. Coupled by their rigidity and unpredictability of learning based control, the ability to safely interact with the environment is missing yet critical. In this work, we present the deployment of a VLA model on a soft continuum manipulator to demonstrate autonomous safe human-robot interaction. We present a structured finetuning and deployment pipeline evaluating two state-of-the-art VLA models (OpenVLA-OFT and $\pi_0$) across representative manipulation tasks, and show while out-of-the-box policies fail due to embodiment mismatch, through targeted finetuning the soft robot performs equally to the rigid counterpart. Our findings highlight the necessity of finetuning for bridging embodiment gaps, and demonstrate that coupling VLA models with soft robots enables safe and flexible embodied AI in human-shared environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 SpaVLE workshop. 4 pages, 2 figures(in main paper, excluding references and supplements)</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has led to a growing demand for AI-enabled wireless networks. The open-source DeepSeek models are famous for their innovative designs, such as large-scale pure RL and cost-efficient training, which make them well-suited for practical deployment in wireless networks. By integrating DeepSeek-style LLMs with wireless infrastructures, a synergistic opportunity arises: the DeepSeek-style LLMs enhance network optimization with strong reasoning and decision-making abilities, while wireless infrastructure enables the broad deployment of these models. Motivated by this convergence, this survey presents a comprehensive DeepSeek-inspired exploration of RL-based LLMs in the context of wireless networks. We begin by reviewing key techniques behind network optimization to establish a foundation for understanding DeepSeek-style LLM integration. Next, we examine recent advancements in RL-based LLMs, using DeepSeek models as a representative example. Building on this, we explore the synergy between the two domains, highlighting motivations, challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we highlight emerging directions for integrating LLMs with wireless networks, such as quantum, on-device, and neural-symbolic LLM models, as well as embodied AI agents. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive examination of the interplay between DeepSeek-style LLMs and wireless networks, demonstrating how these domains can mutually enhance each other to drive innovation.</p></details> | 45 pages, 12 figures |

World models serve as internal simulators that capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2) Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges, including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal consistency while mitigating error accumulation.

| **[Elevating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs with Visual Embedding Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09585v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, the standard practice for developing MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/visper_lm/</p></details> |

Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware, interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Project Page: https://cl-splats.github.io</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel framework, named SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> |

However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2) Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of 8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for future embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Quality Assessment for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16815v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI has developed rapidly in recent years, but it is still mainly deployed in laboratories, with various distortions in the Real-world limiting its application. Traditionally, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are applied to predict human preferences for distorted images; however, there is no IQA method to assess the usability of an image in embodied tasks, namely, the perceptual quality for robots. To provide accurate and reliable quality indicators for future embodied scenarios, we first propose the topic: IQA for Embodied AI. Specifically, we (1) based on the Mertonian system and meta-cognitive theory, constructed a perception-cognition-decision-execution pipeline and defined a comprehensive subjective score collection process; (2) established the Embodied-IQA database, containing over 36k reference/distorted image pairs, with more than 5m fine-grained annotations provided by Vision Language Models/Vision Language Action-models/Real-world robots; (3) trained and validated the performance of mainstream IQA methods on Embodied-IQA, demonstrating the need to develop more accurate quality indicators for Embodied AI. We sincerely hope that through evaluation, we can promote the application of Embodied AI under complex distortions in the Real-world.

However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond 'Templates': Category-Agnostic Object Pose, Size, and Shape Estimation from a Single View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11687v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL, spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D understanding in robotics and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy. For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables, NeurIPS 2025 Camera Ready Version (oral)</p></details> |

However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall, our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied tasks.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Although recent advances in simulation platforms have greatly enhanced task diversity to train embodied Vision Language Models (VLMs), most platforms rely on simplified robot morphologies and bypass the stochastic nature of low-level execution, which limits their transferability to real-world robots. To address these issues, we present a physics-based simulation platform DualTHOR for complex dual-arm humanoid robots, built upon an extended version of AI2-THOR. Our simulator includes real-world robot assets, a task suite for dual-arm collaboration, and inverse kinematics solvers for humanoid robots. We also introduce a contingency mechanism that incorporates potential failures through physics-based low-level execution, bridging the gap to real-world scenarios. Our simulator enables a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness and generalization of VLMs in household environments. Extensive evaluations reveal that current VLMs struggle with dual-arm coordination and exhibit limited robustness in realistic environments with contingencies, highlighting the importance of using our simulator to develop more capable VLMs for embodied tasks.

We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.</p></details> | 6 pages |

A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly triggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions, potentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor attacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on untargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of targeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor attacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such attacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant inference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve attack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal that the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors succeed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger design, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and inference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense against TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream to flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the vulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores the need for more advanced defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 tables, 1 figure.

FormCoach transforms a simple camera into an always-on, interactive AI training partner, capable of spotting subtle form errors and delivering tailored corrections in real time, leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

In a grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop, plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search, belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Unlike previous surveys that often focus on specific modalities or limited fusion strategies, our work presents a structure-centric and method-driven framework that emphasizes generalizable techniques. We systematically categorize and analyze key approaches to alignment and fusion through both structural perspectives -- data-level, feature-level, and output-level fusion -- and methodological paradigms -- including statistical, kernel-based, graphical, generative, contrastive, attention-based, and large language model (LLM)-based methods, drawing insights from an extensive review of over 260 relevant studies. Furthermore, this survey highlights critical challenges such as cross-modal misalignment, computational bottlenecks, data quality issues, and the modality gap, along with recent efforts to address them. Applications ranging from social media analysis and medical imaging to emotion recognition and embodied AI are explored to illustrate the real-world impact of robust multimodal systems. The insights provided aim to guide future research toward optimizing multimodal learning systems for improved scalability, robustness, and generalizability across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCV 2025</p></details> |

For any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs. It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source, specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

These aspects are critical for embodied AI, where agents must act under uncertainty and delayed perception. We introduce FOGMACHINE , an open-source framework that fuses DSGs with discrete-event simulation to model object dynamics, agent observations, and interactions at scale. This setup enables the study of uncertainty propagation, planning under limited perception, and emergent multi-agent behavior. Experiments in urban scenarios illustrate realistic temporal and spatial patterns while revealing the challenges of belief estimation under sparse observations. By combining structured representations with efficient simulation, FOGMACHINE establishes an effective tool for benchmarking, model training, and advancing embodied AI in complex, uncertain environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the IEEE for possible publication; 8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Goal-oriented Backdoor Attack against Vision-Language-Action Models via Physical Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09269v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have greatly improved embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers. Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions. In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and BadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at https://goba-attack.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTR-Bench: Evaluating Geo-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07791v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

While recent studies leverage visual or textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain. Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise, prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D affordance segmentation.</p></details> | Work in process |

While current learning tools show promise for speaking practice, most focus on dyadic, scripted scenarios, limiting opportunities for dynamic group interactions. To address this gap, we present ConversAR, a Mixed Reality system that leverages Generative AI and XR to support situated and personalized group conversations. It integrates embodied AI agents, scene recognition, and generative 3D props anchored to real-world surroundings. Based on a formative study with experts in language acquisition, we developed and tested this system with a user study with 21 second-language learners. Results indicate that the system enhanced learner engagement, increased willingness to communicate, and offered a safe space for speaking. We discuss the implications for integrating Generative AI and XR into the design of future language learning applications.</p></details> | 22 pages |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in semantic reasoning and task planning, a significant gap persists between their high-level understanding and the precise physical execution required for real-world manipulation. To bridge this "semantic-to-physical" gap, we introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world environments, without requiring task-specific training.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, submitted for ICLR 2026 conference</p></details> |

However, their robustness to natural language variability in real-world scenarios has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a novel systematic study of the robustness of state-of-the-art VLA models under linguistic perturbations. Specifically, we evaluate model performance under two types of instruction noise: (1) human-generated paraphrasing and (2) the addition of irrelevant context. We further categorize irrelevant contexts into two groups according to their length and their semantic and lexical proximity to robot commands. In this study, we observe consistent performance degradation as context size expands. We also demonstrate that the model can exhibit relative robustness to random context, with a performance drop within 10%, while semantically and lexically similar context of the same length can trigger a quality decline of around 50%. Human paraphrases of instructions lead to a drop of nearly 20%. To mitigate this, we propose an LLM-based filtering framework that extracts core commands from noisy inputs. Incorporating our filtering step allows models to recover up to 98.5% of their original performance under noisy conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this context, World Models (WMs) have been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a quantitative evaluation of the results.</p></details> |  |

Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative: they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction, enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation. Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at https://worv-ai.github.io/d2e/</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 17 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

These models have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark, VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation. Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.</p></details> | We are revising it |

Despite the rapid progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation. It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs, mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions, conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, Project Page:https://hyelinnam.github.io/Cameo/</p></details> |

Furthermore, we extend our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system.

However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1.

To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions.

These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete. Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models, provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand, advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility, dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers.

| **[What Can RL Bring to VLA Generalization? An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

However, existing interactive segmentation methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained, multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new 3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale, scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines, PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, conference</p></details> |

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Embodied Planning with Verifiable Reward for Real-World Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25852v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the planner. We will open-source both the dataset and the trained model upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning with Vision-Language Models in Ego-Centric Multi-View Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06266v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-and-Language Navigation with Analogical Textual Descriptions in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25139v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions. We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in navigation performance.</p></details> |  |

Yet prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge; and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders, suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability. Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time, and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across four public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a poster in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Intentional Gesture: Deliver Your Intentions with Gestures for Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15197v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When humans speak, gestures help convey communicative intentions, such as adding emphasis or describing concepts. However, current co-speech gesture generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (e.g. speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To address this gap, we introduce Intentional-Gesture, a novel framework that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in high-level communicative functions. First, we curate the InG dataset by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (i.e., text sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the Intentional Gesture Motion Tokenizer to leverage these intention annotations. It injects high-level communicative functions (e.g., intentions) into tokenized motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture</p></details> |  |
| **[Can AI Perceive Physical Danger and Intervene?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21651v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent -- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions. The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at https://asimov-benchmark.github.io/v2</p></details> |  |

Interactable digital twins of such objects have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. Unfortunately, current methods to digitize articulated real-world objects require carefully captured data, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable acquisition. We focus on motion analysis and part-level segmentation of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to obtain at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is challenging due to simultaneous object and camera motion and significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iTACO: a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories that is 20$\times$ larger than available in prior work. We then compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Our experiments show that iTACO outperforms existing articulated object digital twin methods on both synthetic and real casually captured RGBD videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website can be found at https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/video2articulation/</p></details> |

Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models (WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building internal representations and future predictions of the external world, facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances, covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e., embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs, meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE CASM</p></details> |

However, deploying such agents in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes. Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards real-world assistive robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plan Verification for LLM-Based Embodied Task Completion Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02761v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions, redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout). The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25 fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view), providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially, we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the leaderboards of Embodied Arena.

Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.</p></details> |  |

As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate improvements of 20% and 40% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover, our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87-0.97) for the reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to diverse environments with minimal effort.

The main limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent, which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models (VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition.

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

To overcome these obstacles, we propose RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot seamlessly, without any fine-tuning.

| **[Embodied Navigation Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12129v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation is a fundamental capability in embodied AI, representing the intelligence required to perceive and interact within physical environments following language instructions. Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pku-epic.github.io/NavFoM-Web/</p></details> |

Compared to traditional pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception, omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems. Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose omnidirectional AI systems in the embodied AI era.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper presents a draft overview of the emerging field of omnidirectional vision in the context of embodied AI</p></details> |
| **[Learning Precise Affordances from Egocentric Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10123v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Affordance, defined as the potential actions that an object offers, is crucial for embodied AI agents. For example, such knowledge directs an agent to grasp a knife by the handle for cutting or by the blade for safe handover. While existing approaches have made notable progress, affordance research still faces three key challenges: data scarcity, poor generalization, and real-world deployment. Specifically, there is a lack of large-scale affordance datasets with precise segmentation maps, existing models struggle to generalize across different domains or novel object and affordance classes, and little work demonstrates deployability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a complete affordance learning system that (1) takes in egocentric videos and outputs precise affordance annotations without human labeling, (2) leverages geometric information and vision foundation models to improve generalization, and (3) introduces a framework that facilitates affordance-oriented robotic manipulation such as tool grasping and robot-to-human tool handover. Experimental results show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by 13.8% in mIoU, and the framework achieves 77.1% successful grasping among 179 trials, including evaluations on seen, unseen classes, and cluttered scenes.

| **[Integrating Prior Observations for Incremental 3D Scene Graph Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11895v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships. While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world, incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g., CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented architecture will be made available at https://github.com/m4renz/incremental-scene-graph-prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 24th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'25)</p></details> |

It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents.

| **[Nav-R1: Reasoning and Navigation in Embodied Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10884v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation requires agents to integrate perception, reasoning, and action for robust interaction in complex 3D environments. Existing approaches often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought (CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format, understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its robustness under limited onboard resources. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/Nav-R1.

| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v6)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |

Traditional sequential computation patterns, while effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by 2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and providing high throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

| **[Robot Learning from a Physical World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07416v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce PhysWorld, a framework that enables robot learning from video generation through physical world modeling. Recent video generation models can synthesize photorealistic visual demonstrations from language commands and images, offering a powerful yet underexplored source of training signals for robotics. However, directly retargeting pixel motions from generated videos to robots neglects physics, often resulting in inaccurate manipulations. PhysWorld addresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world reconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates task-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the videos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate actions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the physical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into physically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot data collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks demonstrate that PhysWorld substantially improves manipulation accuracy compared to previous approaches.

| **[Unified Humanoid Fall-Safety Policy from a Few Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07407v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Falling is an inherent risk of humanoid mobility. Maintaining stability is thus a primary safety focus in robot control and learning, yet no existing approach fully averts loss of balance. When instability does occur, prior work addresses only isolated aspects of falling: avoiding falls, choreographing a controlled descent, or standing up afterward. Consequently, humanoid robots lack integrated strategies for impact mitigation and prompt recovery when real falls defy these scripts. We aim to go beyond keeping balance to make the entire fall-and-recovery process safe and autonomous: prevent falls when possible, reduce impact when unavoidable, and stand up when fallen. By fusing sparse human demonstrations with reinforcement learning and an adaptive diffusion-based memory of safe reactions, we learn adaptive whole-body behaviors that unify fall prevention, impact mitigation, and rapid recovery in one policy. Experiments in simulation and on a Unitree G1 demonstrate robust sim-to-real transfer, lower impact forces, and consistently fast recovery across diverse disturbances, pointing towards safer, more resilient humanoids in real environments.

| **[Provable Benefit of Curriculum in Transformer Tree-Reasoning Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07372v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent curriculum techniques in the post-training stage of LLMs have been widely observed to outperform non-curriculum approaches in enhancing reasoning performance, yet a principled understanding of why and to what extent they work remains elusive. To address this gap, we develop a theoretical framework grounded in the intuition that progressively learning through manageable steps is more efficient than directly tackling a hard reasoning task, provided each stage stays within the model's effective competence. Under mild complexity conditions linking consecutive curriculum stages, we show that curriculum post-training avoids the exponential complexity bottleneck. To substantiate this result, drawing insights from the Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) solving mathematical problems such as Countdown and parity, we model CoT generation as a states-conditioned autoregressive reasoning tree, define a uniform-branching base model to capture pretrained behavior, and formalize curriculum stages as either depth-increasing (longer reasoning chains) or hint-decreasing (shorter prefixes) subtasks. Our analysis shows that, under outcome-only reward signals, reinforcement learning finetuning achieves high accuracy with polynomial sample complexity, whereas direct learning suffers from an exponential bottleneck. We further establish analogous guarantees for test-time scaling, where curriculum-aware querying reduces both reward oracle calls and sampling cost from exponential to polynomial order.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Computer Use Agents on Human Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07332v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building reliable computer-use agents requires grounding: accurately connecting natural language instructions to the correct on-screen elements. While large datasets exist for web and mobile interactions, high-quality resources for desktop environments are limited. To address this gap, we introduce GroundCUA, a large-scale desktop grounding dataset built from expert human demonstrations. It covers 87 applications across 12 categories and includes 56K screenshots, with every on-screen element carefully annotated for a total of over 3.56M human-verified annotations. From these demonstrations, we generate diverse instructions that capture a wide range of real-world tasks, providing high-quality data for model training. Using GroundCUA, we develop the GroundNext family of models that map instructions to their target UI elements. At both 3B and 7B scales, GroundNext achieves state-of-the-art results across five benchmarks using supervised fine-tuning, while requiring less than one-tenth the training data of prior work. Reinforcement learning post-training further improves performance, and when evaluated in an agentic setting on the OSWorld benchmark using o3 as planner, GroundNext attains comparable or superior results to models trained with substantially more data,. These results demonstrate the critical role of high-quality, expert-driven datasets in advancing general-purpose computer-use agents.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing RAG methods focus on single-step retrieval, which is often insufficient for answering complex questions that require multi-step search. Recently, multi-step retrieval approaches have emerged, typically involving the fine-tuning of small LLMs to perform multi-step retrieval. This type of fine-tuning is highly resource-intensive and does not enable the use of larger LLMs. In this work, we propose Q-RAG, a novel approach that fine-tunes the Embedder model for multi-step retrieval using reinforcement learning (RL). Q-RAG offers a competitive, resource-efficient alternative to existing multi-step retrieval methods for open-domain question answering and achieves state-of-the-art results on the popular long-context benchmarks Babilong and RULER for contexts up to 10M tokens.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\% to 42.5\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks. These findings position IterResearch as a versatile solution for long-horizon reasoning, effective both as a trained agent and as a prompting paradigm for frontier models.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/DeepResearch</p></details> |

In this paper, we formulate the Equity Research Report (ERR) Generation task for the first time. To address the data scarcity and the evaluation metrics absence, we present an open-source evaluation benchmark for ERR generation - FinRpt. We frame a Dataset Construction Pipeline that integrates 7 financial data types and produces a high-quality ERR dataset automatically, which could be used for model training and evaluation. We also introduce a comprehensive evaluation system including 11 metrics to assess the generated ERRs. Moreover, we propose a multi-agent framework specifically tailored to address this task, named FinRpt-Gen, and train several LLM-based agents on the proposed datasets using Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning. Experimental results indicate the data quality and metrics effectiveness of the benchmark FinRpt and the strong performance of FinRpt-Gen, showcasing their potential to drive innovation in the ERR generation field.

| **[RLVE: Scaling Up Reinforcement Learning for Language Models with Adaptive Verifiable Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07317v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Adaptive Verifiable Environments (RLVE), an approach using verifiable environments that procedurally generate problems and provide algorithmically verifiable rewards, to scale up RL for language models (LMs). RLVE enables each verifiable environment to dynamically adapt its problem difficulty distribution to the policy model's capabilities as training progresses. In contrast, static data distributions often lead to vanishing learning signals when problems are either too easy or too hard for the policy. To implement RLVE, we create RLVE-Gym, a large-scale suite of 400 verifiable environments carefully developed through manual environment engineering. Using RLVE-Gym, we show that environment scaling, i.e., expanding the collection of training environments, consistently improves generalizable reasoning capabilities. RLVE with joint training across all 400 environments in RLVE-Gym yields a 3.37% absolute average improvement across six reasoning benchmarks, starting from one of the strongest 1.5B reasoning LMs. By comparison, continuing this LM's original RL training yields only a 0.49% average absolute gain despite using over 3x more compute. We release our code publicly.</p></details> |  |

Among these, Stratego -- a board wargame exemplifying the challenge of strategic decision making under massive amounts of hidden information -- stands apart as a case where such efforts failed to produce performance at the level of top humans. This work establishes a step change in both performance and cost for Stratego, showing that it is now possible not only to reach the level of top humans, but to achieve vastly superhuman level -- and that doing so requires not an industrial budget, but merely a few thousand dollars. We achieved this result by developing general approaches for self-play reinforcement learning and test-time search under imperfect information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tool Zero: Training Tool-Augmented LLMs via Pure RL from Scratch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01934v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training tool-augmented LLMs has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our methods.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 finding |

Imitation Learning (IL) from expert demonstrations bypasses this reliance on rewards. However, state-of-the-art IL methods, exemplified by Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL)Ho et. al, suffer from severe sample inefficiency. This is a direct consequence of their foundational on-policy algorithms, such as TRPO Schulman et.al. In this work, we introduce an adversarial imitation learning algorithm that incorporates off-policy learning to improve sample efficiency. By combining an off-policy framework with auxiliary techniques specifically, double Q network based stabilization and value learning without reward function inference we demonstrate a reduction in the samples required to robustly match expert behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages and 4 images</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation. We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding, mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2 exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://visual-agent.github.io/</p></details> |

This design improves robustness to gradient noise while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of first-order methods. We further propose Anolog, which removes sensitivity to the momentum coefficient by expanding its window over time via a logarithmic schedule. We establish non-convex convergence guarantees with a convergence rate similar to other sign-based methods, and empirically show that Ano provides substantial gains in noisy and non-stationary regimes such as reinforcement learning, while remaining competitive on low-noise tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review for ICLR 2026, 25 pages total with appendix, 7 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

The dominant algorithm, Proximal Policy Optimization~(PPO), employs a critic network to estimate advantages, which introduces significant computational and memory overhead. To address this, a family of critic-free algorithms (e.g., GRPO, RLOO) has emerged. However, these methods typically rely on \textit{prompt-level (local)} advantage normalization, which suffers from inaccurate advantage estimation, a tendency to overfit, and, as we show, is a theoretically biased estimator. To solve these challenges, we introduce REINFORCE++, a critic-free framework centered on \textbf{Global Advantage Normalization}. By normalizing advantages across the entire global batch rather than small, prompt-specific groups, our method provides a more stable and theoretically sound, \textit{effectively unbiased} estimate (whose bias vanishes as batch size increases). We introduce two variants: REINFORCE++, a highly efficient and general algorithm ($k \ge 1$) for general-domain RLHF, and REINFORCE++ /w baseline, a robust group-sampling variant ($k > 1$) for complex reasoning tasks. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that each variant shows superior stability and performance in its respective domain, outperforming existing methods and even PPO in complex agentic settings.</p></details> | refactor |

This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture.

While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have enabled the sampling of chemically plausible compositions and structures, a fundamental challenge remains: the objective misalignment between likelihood-based sampling in generative modelling and targeted focus on underexplored regions where novel compounds reside. Here, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework that guides latent denoising diffusion models toward diverse and novel, yet thermodynamically viable crystalline compounds. Our approach integrates group relative policy optimisation with verifiable, multi-objective rewards that jointly balance creativity, stability, and diversity. Beyond de novo generation, we demonstrate enhanced property-guided design that preserves chemical validity, while targeting desired functional properties. This approach establishes a modular foundation for controllable AI-driven inverse design that addresses the novelty-validity trade-off across scientific discovery applications of generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamics-Decoupled Trajectory Alignment for Sim-to-Real Transfer in Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07155v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in robotics, but deploying RL on real vehicles remains challenging due to the complexity of vehicle dynamics and the mismatch between simulation and reality. Factors such as tire characteristics, road surface conditions, aerodynamic disturbances, and vehicle load make it infeasible to model real-world dynamics accurately, which hinders direct transfer of RL agents trained in simulation. In this paper, we present a framework that decouples motion planning from vehicle control through a spatial and temporal alignment strategy between a virtual vehicle and the real system. An RL agent is first trained in simulation using a kinematic bicycle model to output continuous control actions. Its behavior is then distilled into a trajectory-predicting agent that generates finite-horizon ego-vehicle trajectories, enabling synchronization between virtual and real vehicles. At deployment, a Stanley controller governs lateral dynamics, while longitudinal alignment is maintained through adaptive update mechanisms that compensate for deviations between virtual and real trajectories. We validate our approach on a real vehicle and demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy enables robust zero-shot transfer of RL-based motion planning from simulation to reality, successfully decoupling high-level trajectory generation from low-level vehicle control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mirror Descent Policy Optimisation for Robust Constrained Markov Decision Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23165v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes, making use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser) and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian representing a constrained Markov decision process. Our proposed algorithm obtains an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/T^{1/3}\right)$ convergence rate in the sample-based robust constrained Markov decision process setting. The paper also contributes an algorithm for approximate gradient descent in the space of transition kernels, which is of independent interest for designing adversarial environments in general Markov decision processes. Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-assimilated model-informed reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01755v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The control of spatio-temporally chaos is challenging because of high dimensionality and unpredictability. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) discovers optimal control policies by interacting with the system, typically requiring observations of the full physical state. In practice, sensors often provide only partial and noisy measurements (observations) of the system. The objective of this paper is to develop a framework that enables the control of chaotic systems with partial and noisy observability. The proposed method, data-assimilated model-informed reinforcement learning (DA-MIRL), integrates (i) low-order models to approximate high-dimensional dynamics; (ii) sequential data assimilation to correct the model prediction when observations become available; and (iii) an off-policy actor-critic RL algorithm to adaptively learn an optimal control strategy based on the corrected state estimates. We test DA-MIRL on the spatiotemporally chaotic solutions of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We estimate the full state of the environment with (i) a physics-based model, here, a coarse-grained model; and (ii) a data-driven model, here, the control-aware echo state network, which is proposed in this paper. We show that DA-MIRL successfully estimates and suppresses the chaotic dynamics of the environment in real time from partial observations and approximate models. This work opens opportunities for the control of partially observable chaotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two Heads are Better than One: Distilling Large Language Model Features Into Small Models with Feature Decomposition and Mixture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07110v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Market making (MM) through Reinforcement Learning (RL) has attracted significant attention in financial trading. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an H\'{a}jek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies.</p></details> |  |

Existing prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods remain fixed by prompt rules or training corpora, and are usually benchmarked only on well-structured wiki sources, limiting real-world adaptability. We introduce WebPuzzle, a 24k-sample training and 275-sample test benchmark that evaluates information seeking on the live internet, across both wiki and open-domain queries. Leveraging 7k WebPuzzle instances, we develop DeepDiver, a reinforcement-learning (RL) framework that cultivates Search Intensity Scaling (SIS)-an emergent ability to escalate search frequency and depth instead of settling on overconfident, under-evidenced answers. With SIS, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Pangu-7B-Reasoner attain performance on real-web tasks comparable to the 671B-parameter DeepSeek-R1. We detail DeepDiver's curriculum from cold-start SFT to a well designed RL procedure, and show that its seeking policy generalized from closed-ended queries to open-ended generation such as long-form writing. Our results advance adaptive information seeking in LLMs and provide a rigorous benchmark for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Deadlock Handling among Autonomous Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07071v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This dissertation explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for handling deadlocks in intralogistics systems that rely on autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). AMRs enhance operational flexibility but also increase the risk of deadlocks, which degrade system throughput and reliability. Existing approaches often neglect deadlock handling in the planning phase and rely on rigid control rules that cannot adapt to dynamic operational conditions. To address these shortcomings, this work develops a structured methodology for integrating MARL into logistics planning and operational control. It introduces reference models that explicitly consider deadlock-capable multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems, enabling systematic evaluation of MARL strategies. Using grid-based environments and an external simulation software, the study compares traditional deadlock handling strategies with MARL-based solutions, focusing on PPO and IMPALA algorithms under different training and execution modes. Findings reveal that MARL-based strategies, particularly when combined with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE), outperform rule-based methods in complex, congested environments. In simpler environments or those with ample spatial freedom, rule-based methods remain competitive due to their lower computational demands. These results highlight that MARL provides a flexible and scalable solution for deadlock handling in dynamic intralogistics scenarios, but requires careful tailoring to the operational context.</p></details> | <details><summary>for a...</summary><p>for associated repositories, see https://github.com/Nerozud/dl_reference_models and https://github.com/Nerozud/FTS_simpel</p></details> |
| **[Deep Pareto Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03580v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously is an important task for recommendation platforms to improve their performance. However, this task is particularly challenging since the relationships between different objectives are heterogeneous across different consumers and dynamically fluctuating according to different contexts. Especially in those cases when objectives become conflicting with each other, the result of recommendations will form a pareto-frontier, where the improvements of any objective comes at the cost of a performance decrease of another objective. Existing multi-objective recommender systems do not systematically consider such dynamic relationships; instead, they balance between these objectives in a static and uniform manner, resulting in only suboptimal multi-objective recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a Deep Pareto Reinforcement Learning (DeepPRL) approach, where we (1) comprehensively model the complex relationships between multiple objectives in recommendations; (2) effectively capture personalized and contextual consumer preference for each objective to provide better recommendations; (3) optimize both the short-term and the long-term performance of multi-objective recommendations. As a result, our method achieves significant pareto-dominance over the state-of-the-art baselines in the offline experiments. Furthermore, we conducted a controlled experiment at the video streaming platform of Alibaba, where our method simultaneously improved three conflicting business objectives over the latest production system significantly, demonstrating its tangible economic impact in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Deepfake Detection with Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07051v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generalization capability of deepfake detectors is critical for real-world use. Data augmentation via synthetic fake face generation effectively enhances generalization, yet current SoTA methods rely on fixed strategies-raising a key question: Is a single static augmentation sufficient, or does the diversity of forgery features demand dynamic approaches? We argue existing methods overlook the evolving complexity of real-world forgeries (e.g., facial warping, expression manipulation), which fixed policies cannot fully simulate. To address this, we propose CRDA (Curriculum Reinforcement-Learning Data Augmentation), a novel framework guiding detectors to progressively master multi-domain forgery features from simple to complex. CRDA synthesizes augmented samples via a configurable pool of forgery operations and dynamically generates adversarial samples tailored to the detector's current learning state. Central to our approach is integrating reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference. An RL agent dynamically selects augmentation actions based on detector performance to efficiently explore the vast augmentation space, adapting to increasingly challenging forgeries. Simultaneously, the agent introduces action space variations to generate heterogeneous forgery patterns, guided by causal inference to mitigate spurious correlations-suppressing task-irrelevant biases and focusing on causally invariant features. This integration ensures robust generalization by decoupling synthetic augmentation patterns from the model's learned representations. Extensive experiments show our method significantly improves detector generalizability, outperforming SOTA methods across multiple cross-domain datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Quantized Continuous Controllers for Integer Hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07046v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying continuous-control reinforcement learning policies on embedded hardware requires meeting tight latency and power budgets. Small FPGAs can deliver these, but only if costly floating point pipelines are avoided. We study quantization-aware training (QAT) of policies for integer inference and we present a learning-to-hardware pipeline that automatically selects low-bit policies and synthesizes them to an Artix-7 FPGA. Across five MuJoCo tasks, we obtain policy networks that are competitive with full precision (FP32) policies but require as few as 3 or even only 2 bits per weight, and per internal activation value, as long as input precision is chosen carefully. On the target hardware, the selected policies achieve inference latencies on the order of microseconds and consume microjoules per action, favorably comparing to a quantized reference. Last, we observe that the quantized policies exhibit increased input noise robustness compared to the floating-point baseline.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Dissecting Long-Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Models: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04913v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in training long-chain-of-thought reasoning models via scaling reinforcement learning (RL), its underlying training dynamics remain poorly understood, and several counterintuitive behaviors persist. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in scaling RL, revealing that positive samples mainly facilitate precise fitting to the training data, whereas negative samples significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, while positive samples are essential for convergence in the zero-RL setting, training on negative samples alone suffices to attain strong reasoning performance and even better generalization in cold-start scenarios. (2) We identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization, where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we explore two strategies, including relative length rewards and offline sample injection, to leverage these data better and enhance reasoning efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that greedy decoding can distort evaluation by flipping the correctness of responses.

CUAs present unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction. GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available, instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to facilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop CUAs. The full dataset has been made public on https://huggingface.co/datasets/vyokky/GUI-360.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rectifying Regression in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00885v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06503v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), which enables reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn from human feedback. This is particularly valuable when defining a fine-grain reward function is not feasible. However, this approach is inefficient and impractical for promoting deep exploration in hard-exploration tasks with long horizons and sparse rewards. To tackle this issue, we introduce LOPE: \textbf{L}earning \textbf{O}nline with trajectory \textbf{P}reference guidanc\textbf{E}, an end-to-end preference-guided RL framework that enhances exploration efficiency in hard-exploration tasks. Our intuition is that LOPE directly adjusts the focus of online exploration by considering human feedback as guidance, thereby avoiding the need to learn a separate reward model from preferences. Specifically, LOPE includes a two-step sequential policy optimization technique consisting of trust-region-based policy improvement and preference guidance steps. We reformulate preference guidance as a trajectory-wise state marginal matching problem that minimizes the maximum mean discrepancy distance between the preferred trajectories and the learned policy. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to characterize the performance improvement bound and evaluate the effectiveness of the LOPE. When assessed in various challenging hard-exploration environments, LOPE outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence rate and overall performance.The code used in this study is available at https://github.com/buaawgj/LOPE.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures |

However, unlike natural language corpora, RL trajectories are sparse and reward-driven, making standard self-attention inefficient because it distributes weight uniformly across all past tokens rather than emphasizing the few transitions critical for control. To address this, we introduce structured inductive priors into the self-attention mechanism of the dynamics head: (i) per-head memory-length priors that constrain attention to task-specific windows, and (ii) distributional priors that learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs. We integrate these mechanisms into UniZero, a model-based RL agent with a Transformer-based world model that supports planning under partial observability. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most efficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates attention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate useful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian Attention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores over UniZero. These findings suggest that in partially observable RL domains with non-stationary temporal dependencies, discrete memory windows are difficult to learn reliably, whereas smooth distributional priors flexibly adapt across horizons and yield more robust data efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that encoding structured temporal priors directly into self-attention improves the prioritization of informative histories for dynamics modeling under partial observability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Embodied World Models for Decision Making (EWM) Workshop at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fine-Tuning Diffusion-Based Recommender Systems via Reinforcement Learning with Reward Function Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06937v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for recommender systems, offering state-of-the-art performance by modeling the generative process of user-item interactions. However, training such models from scratch is both computationally expensive and yields diminishing returns once convergence is reached. To remedy these challenges, we propose ReFiT, a new framework that integrates Reinforcement learning (RL)-based Fine-Tuning into diffusion-based recommender systems. In contrast to prior RL approaches for diffusion models depending on external reward models, ReFiT adopts a task-aligned design: it formulates the denoising trajectory as a Markov decision process (MDP) and incorporates a collaborative signal-aware reward function that directly reflects recommendation quality. By tightly coupling the MDP structure with this reward signal, ReFiT empowers the RL agent to exploit high-order connectivity for fine-grained optimization, while avoiding the noisy or uninformative feedback common in naive reward designs. Leveraging policy gradient optimization, ReFiT maximizes exact log-likelihood of observed interactions, thereby enabling effective post hoc fine-tuning of diffusion recommenders. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ReFiT framework (a) exhibits substantial performance gains over strong competitors (up to 36.3% on sequential recommendation), (b) demonstrates strong efficiency with linear complexity in the number of users or items, and (c) generalizes well across multiple diffusion-based recommendation scenarios. The source code and datasets are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReFiT-4C60.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

We present preliminary evidence that DD exists in model-free DRL, investigating it systematically across varying model capacity using the Actor-Critic framework. We rely on an information-theoretic metric, Policy Entropy, to measure policy uncertainty throughout training. Preliminary results show a clear epoch-wise DD curve; the policy's entrance into the second descent region correlates with a sustained, significant reduction in Policy Entropy. This entropic decay suggests that over-parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, guiding the policy towards robust, flatter minima in the loss landscape. These findings establish DD as a factor in DRL and provide an information-based mechanism for designing agents that are more general, transferable, and robust.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the accumulation of model errors over long-horizon rollouts, such methods often face challenges in maintaining modeling stability. To address this, we propose CtrlFlow, a trajectory-level synthetic method using conditional flow matching (CFM), which directly modeling the distribution of trajectories from initial states to high-return terminal states without explicitly modeling the environment transition function. Our method ensures optimal trajectory sampling by minimizing the control energy governed by the non-linear Controllability Gramian Matrix, while the generated diverse trajectory data significantly enhances the robustness and cross-task generalization of policy learning. In online settings, CtrlFlow demonstrates the better performance on common MuJoCo benchmark tasks than dynamics models and achieves superior sample efficiency compared to standard MBRL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, The Fortieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence(AAAI2026)</p></details> |

This algorithm provides solutions to Mean Field Game (MFG) or Mean Field Control (MFC) problems depending on the ratio between two learning rates: one for the value function and the other for the mean field term. In the MFC case, to rigorously identify the limit, we introduce a discretization of the state and action spaces, following the approach used in the finite-space case in [Angiuli et al., 2023b]. The convergence proofs rely on a generalization of the two-timescale framework introduced in [Borkar, 1997]. We further extend our convergence results to Mean Field Control Games, which involve locally cooperative and globally competitive populations. Finally, we present numerical experiments for linear-quadratic problems in one and two dimensions, for which explicit solutions are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[PreferThinker: Reasoning-based Personalized Image Preference Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00609v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized image preference assessment aims to evaluate an individual user's image preferences by relying only on a small set of reference images as prior information. Existing methods mainly focus on general preference assessment, training models with large-scale data to tackle well-defined tasks such as text-image alignment. However, these approaches struggle to handle personalized preference because user-specific data are scarce and not easily scalable, and individual tastes are often diverse and complex. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a common preference profile that serves as a bridge across users, allowing large-scale user data to be leveraged for training profile prediction and capturing complex personalized preferences. Building on this idea, we propose a reasoning-based personalized image preference assessment framework that follows a \textit{predict-then-assess} paradigm: it first predicts a user's preference profile from reference images, and then provides interpretable, multi-dimensional scores and assessments of candidate images based on the predicted profile. To support this, we first construct a large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-style personalized assessment dataset annotated with diverse user preference profiles and high-quality CoT-style reasoning, enabling explicit supervision of structured reasoning. Next, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase to empower the model with structured reasoning capabilities, followed by reinforcement learning to incentivize the model to explore more reasonable assessment paths and enhance generalization. Furthermore, we propose a similarity-aware prediction reward to encourage better prediction of the user's preference profile, which facilitates more reasonable assessments exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods. Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset, and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Ontology, as a structured, information-rich knowledge representation, can provide context, particularly in learning problems. This paper presents OntoTune, an ontology-based platform for enhancing learning for query optimization. By connecting SQL queries, database metadata, and statistics, the ontology developed in this research is promising in capturing relationships and important determinants of query performance. This research also develops a method to embed ontologies while preserving as much of the relationships and key information as possible, before feeding it into learning algorithms such as tree-based and graph-based convolutional networks. A case study shows how OntoTune's ontology-driven learning delivers performance gains compared with database system default query execution.</p></details> |  |

However, a central challenge is the goal setting problem: robots must propose feasible and diverse goals that are achievable in their current environment. Existing methods like RIG (Visual Reinforcement Learning with Imagined Goals) use variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate goals in a learned latent space but have the limitation of producing physically implausible goals that hinder learning efficiency. We propose Physics-Informed RIG (PI-RIG), which integrates physical constraints directly into the VAE training process through a novel Enhanced Physics-Informed Variational Autoencoder (Enhanced p3-VAE), enabling the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals. Our key innovation is the explicit separation of the latent space into physics variables governing object dynamics and environmental factors capturing visual appearance, while enforcing physical consistency through differential equation constraints and conservation laws. This enables the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals that respect fundamental physical principles such as object permanence, collision constraints, and dynamic feasibility. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this physics-informed goal generation significantly improves the quality of proposed goals, leading to more effective exploration and better skill acquisition in visual robotic manipulation tasks including reaching, pushing, and pick-and-place scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Building on the success of Deepseek-R1, researchers extended multimodal reasoning to post-training paradigms based on reinforcement learning (RL), focusing predominantly on mathematical datasets. However, existing post-training paradigms tend to neglect two critical aspects: (1) The lack of quantifiable difficulty metrics capable of strategically screening samples for post-training optimization. (2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose two novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation, while Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction complexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we design a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate consistent superiority of GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples compared to conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines, indicating that strategic data sampling can obviate the need for supervised fine-tuning while improving model accuracy.

To address these challenges, we introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts, DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[F2RVLM: Boosting Fine-grained Fragment Retrieval for Multi-Modal Long-form Dialogue with Vision Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17714v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional dialogue retrieval aims to select the most appropriate utterance or image from recent dialogue history. However, they often fail to meet users' actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments, comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs, these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Markovian Thinker](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06557v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget. With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus. The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink. Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B) often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient, scalable reasoning LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Secure Low-altitude Maritime Communications via Intelligent Jamming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06659v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have emerged as a viable solution for maritime communications. In these maritime LAWNs, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serve as practical low-altitude platforms for wireless communications due to their flexibility and ease of deployment. However, the open and clear UAV communication channels make maritime LAWNs vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. Existing security approaches often assume eavesdroppers follow predefined trajectories, which fails to capture the dynamic movement patterns of eavesdroppers in realistic maritime environments. To address this challenge, we consider a low-altitude maritime communication system that employs intelligent jamming to counter dynamic eavesdroppers with uncertain positioning to enhance the physical layer security. Since such a system requires balancing the conflicting performance metrics of the secrecy rate and energy consumption of UAVs, we formulate a secure and energy-efficient maritime communication multi-objective optimization problem (SEMCMOP). To solve this dynamic and long-term optimization problem, we first reformulate it as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We then propose a novel soft actor-critic with conditional variational autoencoder (SAC-CVAE) algorithm, which is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm improved by generative artificial intelligence. Specifically, the SAC-CVAE algorithm employs advantage-conditioned latent representations to disentangle and optimize policies, while enhancing computational efficiency by reducing the state space dimension. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed intelligent jamming approach achieves secure and energy-efficient maritime communications.</p></details> |  |

However, the extensive coverage of LEO satellites, combined with the openness of channels, can cause the communication process to suffer from security risks. This paper presents a LEO satellite-maritime communication system assisted by low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) friendly-jamming to ensure data security at the physical layer. Since such a system requires balancing the conflicting performance metrics of secrecy rate and energy consumption of the UAV to meet evolving scenario demands, we formulate a secure satellite-maritime communication multi-objective optimization problem (SSMCMOP). In order to solve the dynamic and long-term optimization problem, we reformulate it into a Markov decision process. We then propose a transformer-enhanced soft actor-critic (TransSAC) algorithm, which is a generative artificial intelligence-enabled deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the reformulated problem, thus capturing strong temporal correlations and diversely exploring weights. Simulation results demonstrate that the TransSAC algorithm outperforms comparative approaches and algorithms, maximizing the secrecy rate while effectively minimizing the energy consumption of the UAV. Moreover, the results identify more suitable constraints for the system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bernstein-von Mises for Adaptively Collected Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06639v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for adaptively collected data, such as that coming from adaptive experiments, bandits, or reinforcement learning, is necessary for critical elements of data collection such as ensuring safety and conducting after-study inference. The data's adaptivity creates significant challenges for frequentist UQ, yet Bayesian UQ remains the same as if the data were independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), making it an appealing and commonly used approach. Bayesian UQ requires the (correct) specification of a prior distribution while frequentist UQ does not, but for i.i.d. data the celebrated Bernstein-von Mises theorem shows that as the sample size grows, the prior 'washes out' and Bayesian UQ becomes frequentist-valid, implying that the choice of prior need not be a major impediment to Bayesian UQ as it makes no difference asymptotically. This paper for the first time extends the Bernstein-von Mises theorem to adaptively collected data, proving asymptotic equivalence between Bayesian UQ and Wald-type frequentist UQ in this challenging setting. Our result showing this asymptotic agreement does not require the standard stability condition required by works studying validity of Wald-type frequentist UQ; in cases where stability is satisfied, our results combined with these prior studies of frequentist UQ imply frequentist validity of Bayesian UQ. Counterintuitively however, they also provide a negative result that Bayesian UQ is not asymptotically frequentist valid when stability fails, despite the fact that the prior washes out and Bayesian UQ asymptotically matches standard Wald-type frequentist UQ. We empirically validate our theory (positive and negative) via a range of simulations.</p></details> |  |

Given these document properties, contract drafting and manual examination of contracts have proven to be both arduous and susceptible to errors. This work aims to simplify and automate the task of contract review and analysis using a novel framework for transforming legal contracts into structured semantic graphs, enabling computational analysis and data-driven insights. We introduce a detailed ontology mapping core legal contract elements to their graph-theoretic equivalents of nodes and edges. We then present a reinforcement learning based Large Language Model (LLM) framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships from contracts. Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By applying a carefully drafted reward function of graph metrics, we demonstrate the ability to automatically identify direct relationships between clauses, and even uncover hidden dependencies. Our introduction of the gated GRPO approach shows a strong learning signal and can move contract analysis from a linear, manual reading process to an easily visualized graph. This allows for a more dynamic analysis, including building the groundwork for contract linting similar to what is now practiced in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

Although recent innovations, particularly multimodal large language models, have shown improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO, a mixed-policy reinforcement learning algorithm designed specifically to optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B, EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4\% in clinical metrics across four major datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9\% on unseen datasets.</p></details> | AACL 2025 |

Recent video generation models can synthesize photorealistic visual demonstrations from language commands and images, offering a powerful yet underexplored source of training signals for robotics. However, directly retargeting pixel motions from generated videos to robots neglects physics, often resulting in inaccurate manipulations. PhysWorld addresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world reconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates task-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the videos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate actions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the physical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into physically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot data collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks demonstrate that PhysWorld substantially improves manipulation accuracy compared to previous approaches.

Yet, how to effectively use these models for closed-loop symbolic planning remains largely unexplored. Because they operate as black boxes, LLMs and VLMs can produce unpredictable or costly errors, making their use in high-level robotic planning especially challenging. In this work, we investigate how to use VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners for robotic applications from a control-theoretic perspective. Concretely, we study how the control horizon and warm-starting impact the performance of VLM symbolic planners. We design and conduct controlled experiments to gain insights that are broadly applicable to utilizing VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners, and we discuss recommendations that can help improve the performance of VLM symbolic planners.</p></details> |  |

Simulation provides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often fail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body interactions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots, objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian Splatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation tasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing, demonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world execution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies. Our results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation of robotic manipulation policies.

Personnel with this expertise are often not available outside of larger cities, leading to difficult, costly travel and long wait times for rural populations. To address this issue, tele-ultrasound techniques are being developed, including robotic teleoperation and recently human teleoperation, in which a novice user is remotely guided in a hand-over-hand manner through mixed reality to perform an ultrasound exam. These methods have not been compared, and their relative strengths are unknown. Human teleoperation may be more practical than robotics for small communities due to its lower cost and complexity, but this is only relevant if the performance is comparable. This paper therefore evaluates the differences between human and robotic teleoperation, examining practical aspects such as setup time and flexibility and experimentally comparing performance metrics such as completion time, position tracking, and force consistency. It is found that human teleoperation does not lead to statistically significant differences in completion time or position accuracy, with mean differences of 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively, and provides more consistent force application despite being substantially more practical and accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE TMRB.

Roadmap design, specifying feasible transport routes, directly affects fleet coordination and computational performance. Existing approaches are either grid-based, compromising geometric precision, or continuous-space approaches that disregard practical constraints. This paper presents an automated roadmap generation approach that bridges this gap by operating in continuous-space, integrating station-to-station transport demand and enforcing minimum distance constraints for nodes and edges. By combining free space discretization, transport demand-driven $K$-shortest-path optimization, and path smoothing, the approach produces roadmaps tailored to intralogistics applications. Evaluation across multiple intralogistics use cases demonstrates that the proposed approach consistently outperforms established baselines (4-connected grid, 8-connected grid, and random sampling), achieving lower structural complexity, higher redundancy, and near-optimal path lengths, enabling efficient and robust routing of mobile robot fleets.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the IEEE for possible publication; 8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Deadlock Handling among Autonomous Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07071v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This dissertation explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for handling deadlocks in intralogistics systems that rely on autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). AMRs enhance operational flexibility but also increase the risk of deadlocks, which degrade system throughput and reliability. Existing approaches often neglect deadlock handling in the planning phase and rely on rigid control rules that cannot adapt to dynamic operational conditions. To address these shortcomings, this work develops a structured methodology for integrating MARL into logistics planning and operational control. It introduces reference models that explicitly consider deadlock-capable multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems, enabling systematic evaluation of MARL strategies. Using grid-based environments and an external simulation software, the study compares traditional deadlock handling strategies with MARL-based solutions, focusing on PPO and IMPALA algorithms under different training and execution modes. Findings reveal that MARL-based strategies, particularly when combined with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE), outperform rule-based methods in complex, congested environments. In simpler environments or those with ample spatial freedom, rule-based methods remain competitive due to their lower computational demands. These results highlight that MARL provides a flexible and scalable solution for deadlock handling in dynamic intralogistics scenarios, but requires careful tailoring to the operational context.</p></details> | <details><summary>for a...</summary><p>for associated repositories, see https://github.com/Nerozud/dl_reference_models and https://github.com/Nerozud/FTS_simpel</p></details> |

This paper presents Raspi$^2$USBL, an open-source, Raspberry Pi-based passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) positioning system designed to provide a low-cost and accessible solution for underwater robotic research. The system comprises a passive acoustic receiver and an active beacon. The receiver adopts a modular hardware architecture that integrates a hydrophone array, a multichannel preamplifier, an oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO), a Raspberry Pi 5, and an MCC-series data acquisition (DAQ) board. Apart from the Pi 5, OCXO, and MCC board, the beacon comprises an impedance-matching network, a power amplifier, and a transmitting transducer. An open-source C++ software framework provides high-precision clock synchronization and triggering for one-way travel-time (OWTT) messaging, while performing real-time signal processing, including matched filtering, array beamforming, and adaptive gain control, to estimate the time of flight (TOF) and direction of arrival (DOA) of received signals. The Raspi$^2$USBL system was experimentally validated in an anechoic tank, freshwater lake, and open-sea trials. Results demonstrate a slant-range accuracy better than 0.1%, a bearing accuracy within 0.1$^\circ$, and stable performance over operational distances up to 1.3 km. These findings confirm that low-cost, reproducible hardware can deliver research-grade underwater positioning accuracy. By releasing both the hardware and software as open-source, Raspi$^2$USBL provides a unified reference platform that lowers the entry barrier for underwater robotics laboratories, fosters reproducibility, and promotes collaborative innovation in underwater acoustic navigation and swarm robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Free-T2M: Robust Text-to-Motion Generation for Humanoid Robots via Frequency-Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18232v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling humanoid robots to synthesize complex, physically coherent motions from natural language commands is a cornerstone of autonomous robotics and human-robot interaction. While diffusion models have shown promise in this text-to-motion (T2M) task, they often generate semantically flawed or unstable motions, limiting their applicability to real-world robots. This paper reframes the T2M problem from a frequency-domain perspective, revealing that the generative process mirrors a hierarchical control paradigm. We identify two critical phases: a semantic planning stage, where low-frequency components establish the global motion trajectory, and a fine-grained execution stage, where high-frequency details refine the movement. To address the distinct challenges of each phase, we introduce Frequency enhanced text-to-motion (Free-T2M), a framework incorporating stage-specific frequency-domain consistency alignment. We design a frequency-domain temporal-adaptive module to modulate the alignment effects of different frequency bands. These designs enforce robustness in the foundational semantic plan and enhance the accuracy of detailed execution. Extensive experiments show our method dramatically improves motion quality and semantic correctness. Notably, when applied to the StableMoFusion baseline, Free-T2M reduces the FID from 0.152 to 0.060, establishing a new state-of-the-art within diffusion architectures. These findings underscore the critical role of frequency-domain insights for generating robust and reliable motions, paving the way for more intuitive natural language control of robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Aided Online A* Path Planning for Efficient and Safe Navigation of Service Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06801v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of autonomous service robots in human-centric environments is hindered by a critical gap in perception and planning. Traditional navigation systems rely on expensive LiDARs that, while geometrically precise, are seman- tically unaware, they cannot distinguish a important document on an office floor from a harmless piece of litter, treating both as physically traversable. While advanced semantic segmentation exists, no prior work has successfully integrated this visual intelligence into a real-time path planner that is efficient enough for low-cost, embedded hardware. This paper presents a frame- work to bridge this gap, delivering context-aware navigation on an affordable robotic platform. Our approach centers on a novel, tight integration of a lightweight perception module with an online A* planner. The perception system employs a semantic segmentation model to identify user-defined visual constraints, enabling the robot to navigate based on contextual importance rather than physical size alone. This adaptability allows an operator to define what is critical for a given task, be it sensitive papers in an office or safety lines in a factory, thus resolving the ambiguity of what to avoid. This semantic perception is seamlessly fused with geometric data. The identified visual constraints are projected as non-geometric obstacles onto a global map that is continuously updated from sensor data, enabling robust navigation through both partially known and unknown environments. We validate our framework through extensive experiments in high-fidelity simulations and on a real-world robotic platform. The results demonstrate robust, real-time performance, proving that a cost- effective robot can safely navigate complex environments while respecting critical visual cues invisible to traditional planners.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[SlotVLA: Towards Modeling of Object-Relation Representations in Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06754v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by how humans reason over discrete objects and their relationships, we explore whether compact object-centric and object-relation representations can form a foundation for multitask robotic manipulation. Most existing robotic multitask models rely on dense embeddings that entangle both object and background cues, raising concerns about both efficiency and interpretability. In contrast, we study object-relation-centric representations as a pathway to more structured, efficient, and explainable visuomotor control. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained benchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in robotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric annotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well as instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable visuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based framework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding. It uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object representations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant embeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into executable actions. Experiments on LIBERO+ demonstrate that object-centric slot and object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of required visual tokens, while providing competitive generalization. Together, LIBERO+ and SlotVLA provide a compact, interpretable, and effective foundation for advancing object-relation-centric robotic manipulation.</p></details> | under review |
| **[A Step Toward World Models: A Survey on Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02097v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents are increasingly expected to operate in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments, performing tasks such as manipulation, navigation, and decision-making. Achieving these capabilities requires agents to understand the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of the world, moving beyond reactive control or simple replication of observed states. This motivates the development of world models as internal representations that encode environmental states, capture dynamics, and support prediction, planning, and reasoning. Despite growing interest, the definition, scope, architectures, and essential capabilities of world models remain ambiguous. In this survey, we go beyond prescribing a fixed definition and limiting our scope to methods explicitly labeled as world models. Instead, we examine approaches that exhibit the core capabilities of world models through a review of methods in robotic manipulation. We analyze their roles across perception, prediction, and control, identify key challenges and solutions, and distill the core components, capabilities, and functions that a fully realized world model should possess. Building on this analysis, we aim to motivate further development toward generalizable and practical world models for robotics.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |

However, there is no current way to tractably and directly exploit the design freedom due to the curse of dimensionality. Parameterisable sets of designs offer a pathway towards tractable, modular soft robotics that appropriately harness the behavioural freeform of soft structures to create rich embodied behaviours. In this work, we present a parametrised class of soft actuators, Programmable Telescopic Soft Pneumatic Actuators (PTSPAs). PTSPAs expand axially on inflation for deployable structures and manipulation in challenging confined spaces. We introduce a parametric geometry generator to customise actuator models from high-level inputs, and explore the new design space through semi-automated experimentation and systematic exploration of key parameters. Using it we characterise the actuators' extension/bending, expansion, and stiffness and reveal clear relationships between key design parameters and performance. Finally we demonstrate the application of the actuators in a deployable soft quadruped whose legs deploy to walk, enabling automatic adaptation to confined spaces. PTSPAs present new design paradigm for deployable and shape morphing structures and wherever large length changes are required.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, Submitted to Robosoft 2026</p></details> |
| **[Rapidly Learning Soft Robot Control via Implicit Time-Stepping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06667v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the explosive growth of rigid-body simulators, policy learning in simulation has become the de facto standard for most rigid morphologies. In contrast, soft robotic simulation frameworks remain scarce and are seldom adopted by the soft robotics community. This gap stems partly from the lack of easy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational cost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy learning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy learning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of choice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator capable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further introduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint position control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective means of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of implicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive comparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most widely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping, parallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for non-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a comprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and evaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a rare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/QuantuMope/dismech-rl</p></details> |
| **[CoFineLLM: Conformal Finetuning of LLMs for Language-Instructed Robot Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06575v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as planners for language-instructed agents, generating sequences of actions to accomplish natural language tasks. However, their reliability remains a challenge, especially in long-horizon tasks, since they often produce overconfident yet wrong outputs. Conformal Prediction (CP) has been leveraged to address this issue by wrapping LLM outputs into prediction sets that contain the correct action with a user-defined confidence. When the prediction set is a singleton, the planner executes that action; otherwise, it requests help from a user. This has led to LLM-based planners that can ensure plan correctness with a user-defined probability. However, as LLMs are trained in an uncertainty-agnostic manner, without awareness of prediction sets, they tend to produce unnecessarily large sets, particularly at higher confidence levels, resulting in frequent human interventions limiting autonomous deployment. To address this, we introduce CoFineLLM (Conformal Finetuning for LLMs), the first CP-aware finetuning framework for LLM-based planners that explicitly reduces prediction-set size and, in turn, the need for user interventions. We evaluate our approach on multiple language-instructed robot planning problems and show consistent improvements over uncertainty-aware and uncertainty-agnostic finetuning baselines in terms of prediction-set size, and help rates. Finally, we demonstrate robustness of our method to out-of-distribution scenarios in hardware experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Learning-Based Control Barrier Function for Car-Like Robots: Toward Less Conservative Collision Avoidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08999v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a learning-based Control Barrier Function (CBF) to reduce conservatism in collision avoidance for car-like robots. Traditional CBFs often use the Euclidean distance between robots' centers as a safety margin, which neglects their headings and approximates their geometries as circles. Although this simplification meets the smoothness and differentiability requirements of CBFs, it may result in overly conservative behavior in dense environments. We address this by designing a safety margin that considers both the robot's heading and actual shape, thereby enabling a more precise estimation of safe regions. Because this safety margin is non-differentiable, we approximate it with a neural network to ensure differentiability. In addition, we propose a notion of relative dynamics that makes the learning process tractable. In a case study, we establish the theoretical foundation for applying this notion to a nonlinear kinematic bicycle model. Numerical experiments in overtaking and bypassing scenarios show that our approach reduces conservatism (e.g., requiring 33.5% less lateral space for bypassing) without incurring significant extra computation time.

Whether a legged robot making-and-breaking contact with a floor, or a manipulator grasping objects, contact is everywhere. Unfortunately, the switching of dynamics at contact boundaries makes control difficult. Predictive controllers face non-convex optimization problems when contact is involved. Here, we overcome this difficulty by applying Koopman operators to subsume the segmented dynamics due to contact changes into a unified, globally-linear model in an embedding space. We show that viscoelastic contact at robot-environment interactions underpins the use of Koopman operators without approximation to control inputs. This methodology enables the convex Model Predictive Control of a legged robot, and the real-time control of a manipulator engaged in dynamic pushing. In this work, we show that our method allows robots to discover elaborate control strategies in real-time over time horizons with multiple contact changes, and the method is applicable to broad fields beyond robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive PID Control for Robotic Systems via Hierarchical Meta-Learning and Reinforcement Learning with Physics-Based Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06500v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers remain the predominant choice in industrial robotics due to their simplicity and reliability. However, manual tuning of PID parameters for diverse robotic platforms is time-consuming and requires extensive domain expertise. This paper presents a novel hierarchical control framework that combines meta-learning for PID initialization and reinforcement learning (RL) for online adaptation. To address the sample efficiency challenge, a \textit{physics-based data augmentation} strategy is introduced that generates virtual robot configurations by systematically perturbing physical parameters, enabling effective meta-learning with limited real robot data. The proposed approach is evaluated on two heterogeneous platforms: a 9-DOF Franka Panda manipulator and a 12-DOF Laikago quadruped robot. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 16.6\% average improvement on Franka Panda (6.26{\deg} MAE), with exceptional gains in high-load joints (J2: 80.4\% improvement from 12.36{\deg} to 2.42{\deg}). Critically, this work discovers the \textit{optimization ceiling effect}: RL achieves dramatic improvements when meta-learning exhibits localized high-error joints, but provides no benefit (0.0\%) when baseline performance is uniformly strong, as observed in Laikago. The method demonstrates robust performance under disturbances (parameter uncertainty: +19.2\%, no disturbance: +16.6\%, average: +10.0\%) with only 10 minutes of training time. Multi-seed analysis across 100 random initializations confirms stable performance (4.81+/-1.64\% average). These results establish that RL effectiveness is highly dependent on meta-learning baseline quality and error distribution, providing important design guidance for hierarchical control systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages,12 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |

However, most research simplifies calculations by ignoring leg dynamics, thereby restricting the robot's full motion potential. Additionally, robots face challenges when traversing uneven terrain. To address the aforementioned issue, we develop a complete dynamics model and design a whole-body control framework with terrain estimation for a novel 6 degrees of freedom wheeled bipedal robot. This model incorporates the closed-loop dynamics of the robot and a ground contact model based on the estimated ground normal vector. We use a LiDAR inertial odometry framework and improved Principal Component Analysis for terrain estimation. Task controllers, including PD control law and LQR, are employed for pose control and centroidal dynamics-based balance control, respectively. Furthermore, a hierarchical optimization approach is used to solve the whole-body control problem. We validate the performance of the terrain estimation algorithm and demonstrate the algorithm's robustness and ability to traverse uneven terrain through both simulation and real-world experiments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

The first research community focuses on multimodal sensing of PD-related biomarkers using noninvasive technologies such as inertial measurement units (IMUs), force/pressure insoles, electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), speech and acoustic analysis, and RGB/RGB-D motion capture systems. These studies emphasize data acquisition, feature extraction, and machine learning-based classification for PD screening, diagnosis, and disease progression modeling. In parallel, a second research community has concentrated on robotic intervention and rehabilitation, employing socially assistive robots (SARs), robot-assisted rehabilitation (RAR) systems, and virtual reality (VR)-integrated robotic platforms for improving motor and cognitive function, enhancing social engagement, and supporting caregivers. Despite the complementary goals of these two domains, their methodological and technological integration remains limited, with minimal data- level or decision-level coupling between the two. With the advent of advanced artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), agentic AI systems, a unique opportunity now exists to unify these research streams. We envision a closed-loop sensor-AI-robot framework in which multimodal sensing continuously guides the interaction between the patient, caregiver, humanoid robot (and physician) through AI agents that are powered by a multitude of AI models such as robotic and wearables foundation models, LLM-based reasoning, reinforcement learning, and continual learning. Such closed-loop system enables personalized, explainable, and context-aware intervention, forming the basis for digital twin of the PD patient that can adapt over time to deliver intelligent, patient-centered PD care.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, under review with a journal</p></details> |

Developing robotic systems that emulate human-like operational characteristics through musculoskeletal structures has long been a research focus. In this study, we designed a novel lightweight tendon-driven musculoskeletal arm (LTDM-Arm), featuring a seven degree-of-freedom (DOF) skeletal joint system and a modularized artificial muscular system (MAMS) with 15 actuators. Additionally, we employed a Hilly-type muscle model and data-driven iterative learning control (DDILC) to learn and refine activation signals for repetitive tasks within a finite time frame. We validated the anti-interference capabilities of the musculoskeletal system through both simulations and experiments. The results show that the LTDM-Arm system can effectively achieve desired trajectory tracking tasks, even under load disturbances of 20 % in simulation and 15 % in experiments. This research lays the foundation for developing advanced robotic systems with human-like operational performance.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

However, a key hurdle in achieving this goal lies in the robots' ability to manipulate objects in their unstructured surrounding environments according to different tasks. The learning-based approach is considered an effective way to address generalization. The impressive performance of foundation models in the fields of computer vision and natural language suggests the potential of embedding foundation models into manipulation tasks as a viable path toward achieving general manipulation capability. However, we believe achieving general manipulation capability requires an overarching framework akin to auto driving. This framework should encompass multiple functional modules, with different foundation models assuming distinct roles in facilitating general manipulation capability. This survey focuses on the contributions of foundation models to robot learning for manipulation. We propose a comprehensive framework and detail how foundation models can address challenges in each module of the framework. What's more, we examine current approaches, outline challenges, suggest future research directions, and identify potential risks associated with integrating foundation models into this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Words to Safety: Language-Conditioned Safety Filtering for Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05889v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robots become increasingly integrated into open-world, human-centered environments, their ability to interpret natural language instructions and adhere to safety constraints is critical for effective and trustworthy interaction. Existing approaches often focus on mapping language to reward functions instead of safety specifications or address only narrow constraint classes (e.g., obstacle avoidance), limiting their robustness and applicability. We propose a modular framework for language-conditioned safety in robot navigation. Our framework is composed of three core components: (1) a large language model (LLM)-based module that translates free-form instructions into structured safety specifications, (2) a perception module that grounds these specifications by maintaining object-level 3D representations of the environment, and (3) a model predictive control (MPC)-based safety filter that enforces both semantic and geometric constraints in real time. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through both simulation studies and hardware experiments, demonstrating that it robustly interprets and enforces diverse language-specified constraints across a wide range of environments and scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Mapping Using a Lightweight and Low-Power Monocular Camera Embedded inside a Gripper of Limbed Climbing Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05816v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Limbed climbing robots are designed to explore challenging vertical walls, such as the skylights of the Moon and Mars. In such robots, the primary role of a hand-eye camera is to accurately estimate 3D positions of graspable points (i.e., convex terrain surfaces) thanks to its close-up views. While conventional climbing robots often employ RGB-D cameras as hand-eye cameras to facilitate straightforward 3D terrain mapping and graspable point detection, RGB-D cameras are large and consume considerable power. This work presents a 3D terrain mapping system designed for space exploration using limbed climbing robots equipped with a monocular hand-eye camera. Compared to RGB-D cameras, monocular cameras are more lightweight, compact structures, and have lower power consumption. Although monocular SLAM can be used to construct 3D maps, it suffers from scale ambiguity. To address this limitation, we propose a SLAM method that fuses monocular visual constraints with limb forward kinematics. The proposed method jointly estimates time-series gripper poses and the global metric scale of the 3D map based on factor graph optimization. We validate the proposed framework through both physics-based simulations and real-world experiments. The results demonstrate that our framework constructs a metrically scaled 3D terrain map in real-time and enables autonomous grasping of convex terrain surfaces using a monocular hand-eye camera, without relying on RGB-D cameras. Our method contributes to scalable and energy-efficient perception for future space missions involving limbed climbing robots.

Their compliance and complex, coupled dynamics, however, present modeling and control challenges, hindering path planning and obstacle avoidance. This paper presents a complete, open-source, and reproducible system that enables navigation for a 3-bar tensegrity robot. The system comprises: (i) an inexpensive, open-source hardware design, and (ii) an integrated, open-source software stack for physics-based modeling, system identification, state estimation, path planning, and control. All hardware and software are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/tensegrity-navigation/. The proposed system tracks the robot's pose and executes collision-free paths to a specified goal among known obstacle locations. System robustness is demonstrated through experiments involving unmodeled environmental challenges, including a vertical drop, an incline, and granular media, culminating in an outdoor field demonstration. To validate reproducibility, experiments were conducted using robot instances at two different laboratories. This work provides the robotics community with a complete navigation system for a compliant, impact-resistant, and shape-morphing robot. This system is intended to serve as a springboard for advancing the navigation capabilities of other unconventional robotic platforms.</p></details> |  |

Similarly, physical systems composed of gases, liquids, and solids exhibit random particle motion governed by entropy maximization, yet do not achieve collective objectives. Despite this analogy, no unified framework exists to explain the stochastic behavior in both biological and physical systems. Here, we present empirical evidence from \textit{Formica polyctena} ants that reveals a shared statistical mechanism underlying both systems: maximization under different energy function constraints. We further demonstrate that robotic swarms governed by this principle can exhibit scalable, decentralized cooperation, mimicking physical phase-like behaviors with minimal individual computation. These findings established a unified stochastic model linking biological, physical, and robotic swarms, offering a scalable principle for designing robust and intelligent swarm robotics.</p></details> |  |

In general, we must construct such a 3D interpretation of a complex scene based on limited input, such as a single RGB-D image. We describe SceneComplete, a system for constructing a complete, segmented, 3D model of a scene from a single view. SceneComplete is a novel pipeline for composing general-purpose pretrained perception modules (vision-language, segmentation, image-inpainting, image-to-3D, visual-descriptors and pose-estimation) to obtain highly accurate results. We demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness with respect to ground-truth models in a large benchmark dataset and show that its accurate whole-object reconstruction enables robust grasp proposal generation, including for a dexterous hand.

This work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying small Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on mobile robots to achieve real-time scene understanding and reasoning under strict computational constraints. Unlike prior approaches that separate perception from mobility, the proposed framework enables simultaneous movement and reasoning in dynamic environments using only on-board hardware. The system integrates a compact VLM with multimodal perception to perform contextual interpretation directly on embedded hardware, eliminating reliance on cloud connectivity. Experimental validation highlights the balance between computational efficiency, task accuracy, and system responsiveness. Implementation on a mobile robot confirms one of the first successful deployments of small VLMs for concurrent reasoning and mobility at the edge. This work establishes a foundation for scalable, assured autonomy in applications such as service robotics, disaster response, and defense operations.</p></details> |  |

The system integrates a torque-controlled robotic manipulator with interchangeable passive props (silicone hand replicas and a baton), marker-based physical-virtual registration via a ChArUco board, and a safety monitor that gates motion based on the user's head and hand pose. We introduce two control strategies: (i) a static mode that presents a stationary prop aligned with its virtual counterpart, consistent with prior ETHD baselines, and (ii) a dynamic mode that continuously updates prop position by exponentially blending an initial mid-point trajectory with real-time hand tracking, generating a unique contact point for each interaction. Bench tests show static colocation accuracy of 5.09 +/- 0.94 mm, while user interactions achieved temporal alignment with an average contact latency of 28.53 +/- 31.21 ms across all interaction and control conditions. These results demonstrate the feasibility of recreating socially meaningful haptics in VR. By incorporating essential safety and control mechanisms, ETHOS establishes a practical foundation for high-fidelity, dynamic interpersonal interactions in virtual environments.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, existing obstacle detection and avoidance methods do not consider limits on the forces that manipulators may exert upon contact with delicate obstacles. This work introduces a framework that maps force safety criteria from task space (i.e. positions along the robot's body) to configuration space (i.e. the robot's joint angles) and enables real-time force safety detection. We incorporate limits on allowable environmental contact forces for given task-space obstacles, and map them into configuration space (C-space) through the manipulator's forward kinematics. This formulation ensures that configurations classified as safe are provably below the maximum force thresholds, thereby allowing us to determine force-safe configurations of the soft robot manipulator in real-time. We validate our approach in simulation and hardware experiments on a two-segment pneumatic soft robot manipulator. Results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately detects force safety during interactions with deformable obstacles, thereby laying the foundation for real-time safe planning of soft manipulators in delicate, cluttered environments.</p></details> |  |

Advanced robotic systems often rely on extensive datasets to learn manipulation tasks. In contrast, when humans are faced with unfamiliar tasks, such as assembling a chair, a common approach is to learn by watching video demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning robot policies by Retrieving-from-Video (RfV), using analogies from human demonstrations to address manipulation tasks. Our system constructs a video bank comprising recordings of humans performing diverse daily tasks. To enrich the knowledge from these videos, we extract mid-level information, such as object affordance masks and hand motion trajectories, which serve as additional inputs to enhance the robot model's learning and generalization capabilities. We further feature a dual-component system: a video retriever that taps into an external video bank to fetch task-relevant video based on task specification, and a policy generator that integrates this retrieved knowledge into the learning cycle. This approach enables robots to craft adaptive responses to various scenarios and generalize to tasks beyond those in the training data. Through rigorous testing in multiple simulated and real-world settings, our system demonstrates a marked improvement in performance over conventional robotic systems, showcasing a significant breakthrough in the field of robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

Creating similar swarm intelligence in engineered robots poses challenges to the design of collaborative algorithms that can be programmed at large scales. The assignment-based method has played an eminent role for a very long time in solving collaboration problems of robot swarms. However, it faces fundamental limitations in terms of efficiency and robustness due to its unscalability to swarm variants. This article presents a tutorial review on recent advances in assignment-free collaboration of robot swarms, focusing on the problem of shape formation. A key theoretical component is the recently developed \emph{mean-shift exploration} strategy, which improves the collaboration efficiency of large-scale swarms by dozens of times. Further, the efficiency improvement is more significant as the swarm scale increases. Finally, this article discusses three important applications of the mean-shift exploration strategy, including precise shape formation, area coverage formation, and maneuvering formation, as well as their corresponding industrial scenarios in smart warehousing, area exploration, and cargo transportation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Affordance-based Robot Manipulation with Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01083v5)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a framework for assistive robot manipulation, which focuses on two fundamental challenges: first, efficiently adapting large-scale models to downstream scene affordance understanding tasks, especially in daily living scenarios where gathering multi-task data involving humans requires strenuous effort; second, effectively learning robot action trajectories by grounding the visual affordance model. We tackle the first challenge by employing a parameter-efficient prompt tuning method that prepends learnable text prompts to the frozen vision model to predict manipulation affordances in multi-task scenarios. Then we propose to learn robot action trajectories guided by affordances in a supervised flow matching method. Flow matching represents a robot visuomotor policy as a conditional process of flowing random waypoints to desired robot action trajectories. Finally, we introduce a real-world dataset with 10 tasks across Activities of Daily Living to test our framework. Our extensive evaluation highlights that the proposed prompt tuning method for learning manipulation affordance achieves competitive performance and even outperforms some other finetuning protocols across data scales, while satisfying parameter efficiency. Learning multi-task robot action trajectories with flow matching leads to consistently favorable results in several robot manipulation benchmarks than some alternative behavior cloning methods. This includes more stable training and evaluation, and noticeably faster inference, while maintaining comparable generalization performance to diffusion policy, where flow matching performs marginally better in most cases. Our framework seamlessly unifies affordance learning and action generation with flow matching for robot manipulation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose the Mixture of Experts-Enhanced Diffusion Policy (MoE-DP), where the core idea is to insert a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer between the visual encoder and the diffusion model. This layer decomposes the policy's knowledge into a set of specialized experts, which are dynamically activated to handle different phases of a task. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MoE-DP exhibits a strong capability to recover from disturbances, significantly outperforming standard baselines in robustness. On a suite of 6 long-horizon simulation tasks, this leads to a 36% average relative improvement in success rate under disturbed conditions. This enhanced robustness is further validated in the real world, where MoE-DP also shows significant performance gains. We further show that MoE-DP learns an interpretable skill decomposition, where distinct experts correspond to semantic task primitives (e.g., approaching, grasping).

We present a novel Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based approach that enables systematic generalization from single-context demonstrations to a wide range of unseen start and goal configurations. Our method performs component-level reparameterization of the GMM, adapting both mean vectors and covariance matrices, followed by Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) to generate smooth trajectories. We evaluate the approach on a dual-arm pick-and-place task with varying box placements, comparing against several baselines. Results show that our method significantly outperforms baselines in trajectory success and fidelity, maintaining accuracy even under combined translational and rotational variations of task configurations. These results demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively while ensuring boundary convergence and preserving the intrinsic structure of demonstrated motions.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies reveal that up to 70% of robotics algorithms cannot be reproduced by independent teams, while many others fail to reach deployment because creating shareable software environments remains prohibitively complex. These challenges stem from fragmented, multi-language, and hardware-software toolchains that lead to dependency hell. We present Pixi, a unified package-management framework that addresses these issues by capturing exact dependency states in project-level lockfiles, ensuring bit-for-bit reproducibility across platforms. Its high-performance SAT solver achieves up to 10x faster dependency resolution than comparable tools, while integration of the conda-forge and PyPI ecosystems removes the need for multiple managers. Adopted in over 5,300 projects since 2023, Pixi reduces setup times from hours to minutes and lowers technical barriers for researchers worldwide.

We present a pipeline that integrates 3D generative AI with vision-language models (VLMs) to enable the robotic assembly of multi-component objects from natural language. Our method leverages VLMs for zero-shot, multi-modal reasoning about geometry and functionality to decompose AI-generated meshes into multi-component 3D models using predefined structural and panel components. We demonstrate that a VLM is capable of determining which mesh regions need panel components in addition to structural components, based on the object's geometry and functionality. Evaluation across test objects shows that users preferred the VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, compared to 59.4% for rule-based and 2.5% for random assignment. Lastly, the system allows users to refine component assignments through conversational feedback, enabling greater human control and agency in making physical objects with generative AI and robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025, Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, Creative AI Track</p></details> |
| **[ReGen: Generative Robot Simulation via Inverse Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04769v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation plays a key role in scaling robot learning and validating policies, but constructing simulations remains a labor-intensive process. This paper introduces ReGen, a generative simulation framework that automates simulation design via inverse design. Given a robot's behavior -- such as a motion trajectory or an objective function -- and its textual description, ReGen infers plausible scenarios and environments that could have caused the behavior. ReGen leverages large language models to synthesize scenarios by expanding a directed graph that encodes cause-and-effect relationships, relevant entities, and their properties. This structured graph is then translated into a symbolic program, which configures and executes a robot simulation environment. Our framework supports (i) augmenting simulations based on ego-agent behaviors, (ii) controllable, counterfactual scenario generation, (iii) reasoning about agent cognition and mental states, and (iv) reasoning with distinct sensing modalities, such as braking due to faulty GPS signals. We demonstrate ReGen in autonomous driving and robot manipulation tasks, generating more diverse, complex simulated environments compared to existing simulations with high success rates, and enabling controllable generation for corner cases. This approach enhances the validation of robot policies and supports data or simulation augmentation, advancing scalable robot learning for improved generalization and robustness.

| **[Action Deviation-Aware Inference for Low-Latency Wireless Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02851v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML with computational resources in mobile, edge, and cloud connected over hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: a lightweight on-device model locally generates drafts while a more capable remote target model on a server verifies and corrects them in parallel with speculative sampling, thus resulting in lower latency without compromising accuracy. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each generated action depends on observation updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference (ADAHI), wherein drafts are selectively transmitted and verified based on action deviation, which has a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model. By invoking server operation only when necessary, communication and computational overhead can be reduced while accuracy gain from speculative sampling is preserved. Experiments on our testbed show that ADAHI reduces transmission and server operations by approximately 40%, lowers end-to-end latency by 39.2%, and attains up to 97.2% of the task-success rate of baseline that invokes speculative sampling for every draft embedding vector.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Semantics Connect the Swarm: LLM-Driven Fuzzy Control for Cooperative Multi-Robot Underwater Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00783v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater multi-robot cooperative coverage remains challenging due to partial observability, limited communication, environmental uncertainty, and the lack of access to global localization. To address these issues, this paper presents a semantics-guided fuzzy control framework that couples Large Language Models (LLMs) with interpretable control and lightweight coordination. Raw multimodal observations are compressed by the LLM into compact, human-interpretable semantic tokens that summarize obstacles, unexplored regions, and Objects Of Interest (OOIs) under uncertain perception. A fuzzy inference system with pre-defined membership functions then maps these tokens into smooth and stable steering and gait commands, enabling reliable navigation without relying on global positioning. Then, we further coordinate multiple robots by introducing semantic communication that shares intent and local context in linguistic form, enabling agreement on who explores where while avoiding redundant revisits. Extensive simulations in unknown reef-like environments show that, under limited sensing and communication, the proposed framework achieves robust OOI-oriented navigation and cooperative coverage with improved efficiency and adaptability, narrowing the gap between semantic cognition and distributed underwater control in GPS-denied, map-free conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.

We introduce \textit{ForeRobo}, a generative robotic agent that utilizes generative simulations to autonomously acquire manipulation skills driven by envisioned goal states. Instead of directly learning low-level policies, we advocate integrating generative paradigms with classical control. Our approach equips a robotic agent with a self-guided \textit{propose-generate-learn-actuate} cycle. The agent first proposes the skills to be acquired and constructs the corresponding simulation environments; it then configures objects into appropriate arrangements to generate skill-consistent goal states (\textit{ForeGen}). Subsequently, the virtually infinite data produced by ForeGen are used to train the proposed state generation model (\textit{ForeFormer}), which establishes point-wise correspondences by predicting the 3D goal position of every point in the current state, based on the scene state and task instructions. Finally, classical control algorithms are employed to drive the robot in real-world environments to execute actions based on the envisioned goal states. Compared with end-to-end policy learning methods, ForeFormer offers superior interpretability and execution efficiency. We train and benchmark ForeFormer across a variety of rigid-body and articulated-object manipulation tasks, and observe an average improvement of 56.32\% over the state-of-the-art state generation models, demonstrating strong generality across different manipulation patterns. Moreover, in real-world evaluations involving more than 20 robotic tasks, ForeRobo achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities, attaining an average success rate of 79.28\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraspView: Active Perception Scoring and Best-View Optimization for Robotic Grasping in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04199v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic grasping is a fundamental capability for autonomous manipulation, yet remains highly challenging in cluttered environments where occlusion, poor perception quality, and inconsistent 3D reconstructions often lead to unstable or failed grasps. Conventional pipelines have widely relied on RGB-D cameras to provide geometric information, which fail on transparent or glossy objects and degrade at close range. We present GraspView, an RGB-only robotic grasping pipeline that achieves accurate manipulation in cluttered environments without depth sensors. Our framework integrates three key components: (i) global perception scene reconstruction, which provides locally consistent, up-to-scale geometry from a single RGB view and fuses multi-view projections into a coherent global 3D scene; (ii) a render-and-score active perception strategy, which dynamically selects next-best-views to reveal occluded regions; and (iii) an online metric alignment module that calibrates VGGT predictions against robot kinematics to ensure physical scale consistency. Building on these tailor-designed modules, GraspView performs best-view global grasping, fusing multi-view reconstructions and leveraging GraspNet for robust execution. Experiments on diverse tabletop objects demonstrate that GraspView significantly outperforms both RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines, especially under heavy occlusion, near-field sensing, and with transparent objects. These results highlight GraspView as a practical and versatile alternative to RGB-D pipelines, enabling reliable grasping in unstructured real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement Learning framework and a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism. The Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization framework jointly optimizes travel distance and map uncertainty through a dual-objective reward function, balancing exploration and exploitation. The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces redundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update Stagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental results show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our approach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up to 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments while maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the collaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation on a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical applicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

High deposition rate robotic AM (HDRRAM) processes, such as cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM), offer significantly increased build speeds by delivering large volumes of material per unit time. However, maintaining shape accuracy remains a critical challenge, particularly due to process instabilities in current open-loop systems. Detecting these deviations as they occur is essential to prevent error propagation, ensure part quality, and minimize post-processing requirements. This study presents a real-time monitoring system to acquire and reconstruct the growing part and directly compares it with a near-net reference model to detect the shape deviation during the manufacturing process. The early identification of shape inconsistencies, followed by segmenting and tracking each deviation region, paves the way for timely intervention and compensation to achieve consistent part quality.</p></details> |  |

Existing research typically emphasizes human safety or manipulative efficiency, whereas our proposed method uniquely integrates both aspects to strengthen collaboration across diverse conditions (e.g., different grasping postures of humans, and different shapes of objects). Specifically, the joint angles of a simplified human skeleton model are optimized by minimizing the cost function to prioritize safety and manipulative capability. To guide humans towards the optimized posture, the reference end-effector poses of the robot are generated through a transformation module. A bimanual model predictive impedance controller (MPIC) is proposed for our human-like robot, CURI, to recalibrate the end effector poses through planned trajectories. The proposed method has been validated through various subjects and objects during human-human collaboration (HHC) and human-robot collaboration (HRC). The experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in muscle conditions by comparing the activation of target muscles before and after optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, IROS 2025 accepted</p></details> |

However, existing systems typically rely on decoupled modules, resulting in delayed responses and incoherent behaviors in dynamic environments, while real-world perceptual limitations further exacerbate these issues. In this work, we present a unified reinforcement learning-based controller that enables humanoid robots to acquire reactive soccer skills through the direct integration of visual perception and motion control. Our approach extends Adversarial Motion Priors to perceptual settings in real-world dynamic environments, bridging motion imitation and visually grounded dynamic control. We introduce an encoder-decoder architecture combined with a virtual perception system that models real-world visual characteristics, allowing the policy to recover privileged states from imperfect observations and establish active coordination between perception and action. The resulting controller demonstrates strong reactivity, consistently executing coherent and robust soccer behaviors across various scenarios, including real RoboCup matches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://humanoid-kick.github.io</p></details> |

However, most existing models rely solely on RGB cameras, limiting their perception and, consequently, manipulation capabilities. We present OmniVLA, an omni-modality VLA model that integrates novel sensing modalities for physically-grounded spatial intelligence beyond RGB perception. The core of our approach is the sensor-masked image, a unified representation that overlays spatially grounded and physically meaningful masks onto the RGB images, derived from sensors including an infrared camera, a mmWave radar, and a microphone array. This image-native unification keeps sensor input close to RGB statistics to facilitate training, provides a uniform interface across sensor hardware, and enables data-efficient learning with lightweight per-sensor projectors. Built on this, we present a multisensory vision-language-action model architecture and train the model based on an RGB-pretrained VLA backbone. We evaluate OmniVLA on challenging real-world tasks where sensor-modality perception guides the robotic manipulation. OmniVLA achieves an average task success rate of 84%, significantly outperforms both RGB-only and raw-sensor-input baseline models by 59% and 28% respectively, meanwhile showing higher learning efficiency and stronger generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

However, effective dynamic shape control requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional dynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for modeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating linear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three methods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each class of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies for the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three experiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be feasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model of eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a reduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies generated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models.</p></details> | 20 Pages, 8 Figures |

To support the design optimization and control of such systems, accurate, interpretable, and computationally tractable modeling of the underlying swimming dynamics is indispensable. In this letter, we present a full-body dynamics model for motor-actuated robotic fish, rigorously derived from Hamilton's principle. The model captures the continuously distributed elasticity of a deformable fish body undergoing large deformations and incorporates fluid-structure coupling effects, enabling self-propelled motion without prescribing kinematics. Preliminary open-loop simulations examine how actuation frequency and body stiffness influence the swimming speed and energy efficiency of the robotic fish. Closed-loop simulations further assess how stiffness distribution impacts the controller's velocity-tracking performance and energy efficiency. The results demonstrate the model's potential for performance evaluation and control optimization of soft robotic swimmers when stiffness is treated as a design variable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

However, it remains unclear whether this approach applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic intra-operative spinal navigation.</p></details> |  |

We achieve this improvement in scalability by extending the state-of-the-art Decomposable State Space Hypergraph (DaSH) multi-robot planning framework to support mobile robot motion planning in congested environments. This is a problem that DaSH cannot be directly applied to because it lacks a highly structured, easily discretizable task space and features kinodynamic constraints. We accomplish this by exploiting knowledge about the workspace topology to limit exploration of the planning space and through modifying DaSH's conflict resolution scheme. This guidance captures when coordination between robots is necessary, allowing us to decompose the intractably large multi-robot search space while limiting risk of inter-robot conflicts by composing relevant robot groups together while planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for review</p></details> |

As a result, a great abundance of compact swarm robots have been developed. The simplest are bristle-bots that self-propel via converting their vibration with the help of elastic bristles. However, many platforms are optimized for a certain class of studies, are not always made open-source, or have limited customization potential. To address these issues, we develop the open-source Swarmodroid 1.0 platform based on bristle-bots with reconfigurable 3D printed bodies and simple electronics that possess external control of motion velocity and demonstrate basic capabilities of trajectory adjustment. Then, we perform a detailed analysis of individual Swarmodroids' motion characteristics and their kinematics.

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in training policies for specific autonomous robots, existing frameworks and benchmarks are often constrained to unique platforms, limiting generalization and fair comparisons across different mobility systems. In this paper, we present a multi-domain framework for training, evaluating and deploying RL-based navigation policies across diverse robotic platforms and operational environments. Our work presents four key contributions: (1) a scalable and modular framework, facilitating seamless robot-task interchangeability and reproducible training pipelines; (2) sim-to-real transfer demonstrated through real-world experiments with multiple robots, including a satellite robotic simulator, an unmanned surface vessel, and a wheeled ground vehicle; (3) the release of the first open-source API for deploying Isaac Lab-trained policies to real robots, enabling lightweight inference and rapid field validation; and (4) uniform tasks and metrics for cross-medium evaluation, through a unified evaluation testbed to assess performance of navigation tasks in diverse operational conditions (aquatic, terrestrial and space). By ensuring consistency between simulation and real-world deployment, RoboRAN lowers the barrier to developing adaptable RL-based navigation strategies. Its modular design enables straightforward integration of new robots and tasks through predefined templates, fostering reproducibility and extension to diverse domains.

To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user personalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference conflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically assumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates both users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment, allowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts. Preferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose strength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's properties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic case study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting preferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment task. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base scores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and contextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and context-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work advances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to data-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to a journal</p></details> |

We present OneOcc, a vision-only panoramic SSC framework designed for gait-introduced body jitter and 360{\deg} continuity. OneOcc combines: (i) Dual-Projection fusion (DP-ER) to exploit the annular panorama and its equirectangular unfolding, preserving 360{\deg} continuity and grid alignment; (ii) Bi-Grid Voxelization (BGV) to reason in Cartesian and cylindrical-polar spaces, reducing discretization bias and sharpening free/occupied boundaries; (iii) a lightweight decoder with Hierarchical AMoE-3D for dynamic multi-scale fusion and better long-range/occlusion reasoning; and (iv) plug-and-play Gait Displacement Compensation (GDC) learning feature-level motion correction without extra sensors. We also release two panoramic occupancy benchmarks: QuadOcc (real quadruped, first-person 360{\deg}) and Human360Occ (H3O) (CARLA human-ego 360{\deg} with RGB, Depth, semantic occupancy; standardized within-/cross-city splits). OneOcc sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA): on QuadOcc it beats strong vision baselines and popular LiDAR ones; on H3O it gains +3.83 mIoU (within-city) and +8.08 (cross-city). Modules are lightweight, enabling deployable full-surround perception for legged/humanoid robots.

Experimental specimens in the life sciences are subject to individual variability and hence require intricate algorithms for successful autonomous robotic control. As a use case, we are studying the cranial window creation in mice. This operation requires the removal of an 8-mm circular patch of the skull, which is approximately 300 um thick, but the shape and thickness of the mouse skull significantly varies depending on the strain of the mouse, sex, and age. In this work, we develop an autonomous robotic drilling system with no offline planning, consisting of a trajectory planner with execution-time feedback with drilling completion level recognition based on image and force information. In the experiments, we first evaluate the image-and-force-based drilling completion level recognition by comparing it with other state-of-the-art deep learning image processing methods and conduct an ablation study in eggshell drilling to evaluate the impact of each module on system performance. Finally, the system performance is further evaluated in postmortem mice, achieving a success rate of 70% (14/20 trials) with an average drilling time of 9.3 min.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures, accepted on T-ASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Indicating Robot Vision Capabilities with Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03550v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research indicates that humans can mistakenly assume that robots and humans have the same field of view (FoV), possessing an inaccurate mental model of robots. This misperception may lead to failures during human-robot collaboration tasks where robots might be asked to complete impossible tasks about out-of-view objects. The issue is more severe when robots do not have a chance to scan the scene to update their world model while focusing on assigned tasks. To help align humans' mental models of robots' vision capabilities, we propose four FoV indicators in augmented reality (AR) and conducted a user human-subjects experiment (N=41) to evaluate them in terms of accuracy, confidence, task efficiency, and workload. These indicators span a spectrum from egocentric (robot's eye and head space) to allocentric (task space). Results showed that the allocentric blocks at the task space had the highest accuracy with a delay in interpreting the robot's FoV. The egocentric indicator of deeper eye sockets, possible for physical alteration, also increased accuracy. In all indicators, participants' confidence was high while cognitive load remained low. Finally, we contribute six guidelines for practitioners to apply our AR indicators or physical alterations to align humans' mental models with robots' vision capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROSBag MCP Server: Analyzing Robot Data with LLMs for Agentic Embodied AI Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03497v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.

| **[Value Elicitation for a Socially Assistive Robot Addressing Social Anxiety: A Participatory Design Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03444v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social anxiety is a prevalent mental health condition that can significantly impact overall well-being and quality of life. Despite its widespread effects, adequate support or treatment for social anxiety is often insufficient. Advances in technology, particularly in social robotics, offer promising opportunities to complement traditional mental health. As an initial step toward developing effective solutions, it is essential to understand the values that shape what is considered meaningful, acceptable, and helpful. In this study, a participatory design workshop was conducted with mental health academic researchers to elicit the underlying values that should inform the design of socially assistive robots for social anxiety support. Through creative, reflective, and envisioning activities, participants explored scenarios and design possibilities, allowing for systematic elicitation of values, expectations, needs, and preferences related to robot-supported interventions. The findings reveal rich insights into design-relevant values-including adaptivity, acceptance, and efficacy-that are core to support for individuals with social anxiety. This study highlights the significance of a research-led approach to value elicitation, emphasising user-centred and context-aware design considerations in the development of socially assistive robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Value Engineering in AI (VALE) Workshop (ECAI 2025)</p></details> |

In contrast, traditional rigid robots offer high accuracy and repeatability but lack the flexibility of soft robots. We argue that combining these characteristics in a hybrid robotic platform can significantly enhance overall capabilities. This work presents a novel hybrid robotic platform that integrates a rigid manipulator with a fully developed soft arm. This system is equipped with the intelligence necessary to perform flexible and generalizable tasks through imitation learning autonomously. The physical softness and machine learning enable our platform to achieve highly generalizable skills, while the rigid components ensure precision and repeatability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update with additional results and experiments</p></details> |
| **[GUIDES: Guidance Using Instructor-Distilled Embeddings for Pre-trained Robot Policy Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03400v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained robot policies serve as the foundation of many validated robotic systems, which encapsulate extensive embodied knowledge. However, they often lack the semantic awareness characteristic of foundation models, and replacing them entirely is impractical in many situations due to high costs and the loss of accumulated knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a lightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance from foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs a fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual instructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance embeddings. These embeddings are injected into the policy's latent space, allowing the legacy model to adapt to this new semantic input through brief, targeted fine-tuning. For inference-time robustness, a large language model-based Reflector monitors the Instructor's confidence and, when confidence is low, initiates a reasoning loop that analyzes execution history, retrieves relevant examples, and augments the VLM's context to refine subsequent actions. Extensive validation in the RoboCasa simulation environment across diverse policy architectures shows consistent and substantial improvements in task success rates. Real-world deployment on a UR5 robot further demonstrates that GUIDES enhances motion precision for critical sub-tasks such as grasping. Overall, GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade, rather than replace, validated robot policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, Accepted by IEEE IROS 2025 Workshop WIR-M</p></details> |
| **[Augmented Reality for RObots (ARRO): Pointing Visuomotor Policies Towards Visual Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08627v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visuomotor policies trained on human expert demonstrations have recently shown strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. However, these policies remain highly sensitive to domain shifts stemming from background or robot embodiment changes, which limits their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we present ARRO, a novel visual representation that leverages zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation and object detection models to efficiently mask out task-irrelevant regions of the scene in real time without requiring additional training, modeling of the setup, or camera calibration. By filtering visual distractors and overlaying virtual guides during both training and inference, ARRO improves robustness to scene variations and reduces the need for additional data collection. We extensively evaluate ARRO with Diffusion Policy on a range of tabletop manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments, and further demonstrate its compatibility and effectiveness with generalist robot policies, such as Octo and OpenVLA. Across all settings in our evaluation, ARRO yields consistent performance gains, allows for selective masking to choose between different objects, and shows robustness even to challenging segmentation conditions.

| **[Collaborative Assembly Policy Learning of a Sightless Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03189v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores a physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) task involving the joint insertion of a board into a frame by a sightless robot and a human operator. While admittance control is commonly used in pHRC tasks, it can be challenging to measure the force/torque applied by the human for accurate human intent estimation, limiting the robot's ability to assist in the collaborative task. Other methods that attempt to solve pHRC tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) are also unsuitable for the board-insertion task due to its safety constraints and sparse rewards. Therefore, we propose a novel RL approach that utilizes a human-designed admittance controller to facilitate more active robot behavior and reduce human effort. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms admittance control in terms of success rate and task completion time. Additionally, we observed a significant reduction in measured force/torque when using our proposed approach compared to admittance control.

| **[Learning-based Cooperative Robotic Paper Wrapping: A Unified Control Policy with Residual Force Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03181v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-robot cooperation is essential in environments such as warehouses and retail stores, where workers frequently handle deformable objects like paper, bags, and fabrics. Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains difficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the need for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the task of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem involving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper. Success is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly wrapped package with clean folds and no tears. We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task planner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is a Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from human demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal dependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike vanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short tasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal grounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process and supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than merely replicating motion sequences. Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks. We show that the unified transformer-based policy reduces the need for specialized models, allows controlled human supervision, and effectively bridges high-level intent with the fine-grained force control required for deformable object manipulation.</p></details> |  |

The motion planning of this system faces challenges due to the interactions between the cable's state transitions, the trailer's nonholonomic constraints, and the system's underactuation. To address these challenges, we first develop a hybrid dynamics model that captures the cable's taut and slack states. A search algorithm is then introduced to compute a suboptimal trajectory while incorporating mode transitions. Additionally, we propose a novel collision avoidance constraint based on geometric polygons to formulate the trajectory optimization problem for the hybrid system. The proposed method is implemented on a Unitree A1 quadruped robot with a customized cable-trailer and validated through experiments. The real system demonstrates both agile and safe motion with cable mode transitions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, Accept by RA-L 2025</p></details> |

We introduce AURA (Autonomous Resilience Agent), a collaborative framework for anomaly and fault diagnostics in robotics. AURA integrates large language models (LLMs), a high-fidelity digital twin (DT), and human-in-the-loop interaction to detect and respond to anomalous behavior in real time. The architecture uses two agents with clear roles: (i) a low-level State Anomaly Characterization Agent that monitors telemetry and converts signals into a structured natural-language problem description, and (ii) a high-level Diagnostic Reasoning Agent that conducts a knowledge-grounded dialogue with an operator to identify root causes, drawing on external sources. Human-validated diagnoses are then converted into new training examples that refine the low-level perceptual model. This feedback loop progressively distills expert knowledge into the AI, transforming it from a static tool into an adaptive partner. We describe the framework's operating principles and provide a concrete implementation, establishing a pattern for trustworthy, continually improving human-robot teams.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper was submitted for ICRA 2026</p></details> |
| **[Mobile Robotic Multi-View Photometric Stereo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10842v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-View Photometric Stereo (MVPS) is a popular method for fine-detailed 3D acquisition of an object from images. Despite its outstanding results on diverse material objects, a typical MVPS experimental setup requires a well-calibrated light source and a monocular camera installed on an immovable base. This restricts the use of MVPS on a movable platform, limiting us from taking MVPS benefits in 3D acquisition for mobile robotics applications. To this end, we introduce a new mobile robotic system for MVPS. While the proposed system brings advantages, it introduces additional algorithmic challenges. Addressing them, in this paper, we further propose an incremental approach for mobile robotic MVPS. Our approach leverages a supervised learning setup to predict per-view surface normal, object depth, and per-pixel uncertainty in model-predicted results. A refined depth map per view is obtained by solving an MVPS-driven optimization problem proposed in this paper. Later, we fuse the refined depth map while tracking the camera pose w.r.t the reference frame to recover globally consistent object 3D geometry. Experimental results show the advantages of our robotic system and algorithm, featuring the local high-frequency surface detail recovery with globally consistent object shape. Our work is beyond any MVPS system yet presented, providing encouraging results on objects with unknown reflectance properties using fewer frames without a tiring calibration and installation process, enabling computationally efficient robotic automation approach to photogrammetry. The proposed approach is nearly 100 times computationally faster than the state-of-the-art MVPS methods such as [1, 2] while maintaining the similar results when tested on subjects taken from the benchmark DiLiGenT MV dataset [3].</p></details> | <details><summary>Ackno...</summary><p>Acknowledgment Added.

Bimanual robotic piano playing represents a particularly challenging task: it is high-dimensional, contact-rich, and requires fast, precise control. We present OmniPianist, the first agent capable of performing nearly one thousand music pieces via scalable, human-demonstration-free learning. Our approach is built on three core components. First, we introduce an automatic fingering strategy based on Optimal Transport (OT), allowing the agent to autonomously discover efficient piano-playing strategies from scratch without demonstrations. Second, we conduct large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) by training more than 2,000 agents, each specialized in distinct music pieces, and aggregate their experience into a dataset named RP1M++, consisting of over one million trajectories for robotic piano playing. Finally, we employ a Flow Matching Transformer to leverage RP1M++ through large-scale imitation learning, resulting in the OmniPianist agent capable of performing a wide range of musical pieces. Extensive experiments and ablation studies highlight the effectiveness and scalability of our approach, advancing dexterous robotic piano playing at scale.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks, combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity poses challenges for their application on edge devices and in the context of Mobile Robotics, especially considering the trade-off between accuracy and inference time.

To leverage knowledge from large-scale pretraining, prior work (VLA) has typically built generalist policies either on top of vision-language understanding models (VLMs) or generative models. However, both semantic understanding from vision-language pretraining and visual dynamics modeling from visual-generation pretraining are crucial for embodied robots. Recent unified models of generation and understanding have demonstrated strong capabilities in both comprehension and generation through large-scale pretraining. We posit that robotic policy learning can likewise benefit from the combined strengths of understanding, planning, and continuous future representation learning. Building on this insight, we introduce UniCoD, which acquires the ability to dynamically model high-dimensional visual features through pretraining on over 1M internet-scale instructional manipulation videos. Subsequently, UniCoD is fine-tuned on data collected from the robot embodiment, enabling the learning of mappings from predictive representations to action tokens. Extensive experiments show our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of 9\% and 12\% across simulation environments and real-world out-of-distribution tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a unified framework for robot-assisted drone recovery on a wavy surface that addresses two major tasks: Firstly, accurate prediction of a moving drone's position under wave-induced disturbances using KalmanNet Plus Plus (KalmanNet++), a Neural Network Aided Kalman Filtering we proposed. Secondly, effective motion planning using the desired position we got for a manipulator via Receding Horizon Model Predictive Control (RHMPC). Specifically, we compared multiple prediction methods and proposed KalmanNet Plus Plus to predict the position of the UAV, thereby obtaining the desired position. The KalmanNet++ predicts the drone's future position 0.1\,s ahead, while the manipulator plans a capture trajectory in real time, thus overcoming not only wave-induced base motions but also limited constraints such as torque constraints and joint constraints. For the system design, we provide a collaborative system, comprising a manipulator subsystem and a UAV subsystem, enables drone lifting and drone recovery. Simulation and real-world experiments using wave-disturbed motion data demonstrate that our approach achieves a high success rate - above 95\% and outperforms conventional baseline methods by up to 10\% in efficiency and 20\% in precision. The results underscore the feasibility and robustness of our system, which achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers a practical solution for maritime drone operations.</p></details> | 17 pages, 51 figures |

However, this one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper contextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their behavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to language (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent capable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal representations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We introduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such bidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly trained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from language (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying semantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a self-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data through an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby improving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on pick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY improves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust language-action grounding for robotic manipulation.

| **[Rethinking Bimanual Robotic Manipulation: Learning with Decoupled Interaction Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09186v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bimanual robotic manipulation is an emerging and critical topic in the robotics community. Previous works primarily rely on integrated control models that take the perceptions and states of both arms as inputs to directly predict their actions. However, we think bimanual manipulation involves not only coordinated tasks but also various uncoordinated tasks that do not require explicit cooperation during execution, such as grasping objects with the closest hand, which integrated control frameworks ignore to consider due to their enforced cooperation in the early inputs. In this paper, we propose a novel decoupled interaction framework that considers the characteristics of different tasks in bimanual manipulation. The key insight of our framework is to assign an independent model to each arm to enhance the learning of uncoordinated tasks, while introducing a selective interaction module that adaptively learns weights from its own arm to improve the learning of coordinated tasks. Extensive experiments on seven tasks in the RoboTwin dataset demonstrate that: (1) Our framework achieves outstanding performance, with a 23.5% boost over the SOTA method. (2) Our framework is flexible and can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods. (3) Our framework can be effectively extended to multi-agent manipulation tasks, achieving a 28% boost over the integrated control SOTA. (4) The performance boost stems from the decoupled design itself, surpassing the SOTA by 16.5% in success rate with only 1/6 of the model size.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

However, challenges remain in applying these models to 3D spatial interactions and managing data collection costs. To address these issues, we propose the multimodal robotic manipulation model RoboTron-Mani and the comprehensive dataset RoboData. RoboTron-Mani, on one hand, enhances 3D perception through camera parameters and occupancy supervision. On the other hand, it further incorporates Modality-Isolation-Mask and multimodal decoder blocks based on OpenFlamingo, improving modality fusion and fine-grained perception. RoboData integrats several publicly-available datasets, achieving the first fusion of multi-view images, camera parameters, depth maps, actions, and space alignment, which facilitates comprehensive learning from diverse robotic datasets and offers one complete evaluation system. Trained on RoboData, RoboTron-Mani is the first generalist policy that surpasses expert models, enabling simultaneous evaluation of all tasks across multiple datasets, rather than being limited to specific data or task selections. Specifically, RoboTron-Mani boosts manipulation performance by increasing the average sequence length on CALVIN from 1.7 to 3.5, enabling cross-embodiment generalization, and achieving state-of-the-art results on both simulated and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Quantitative Comparison of Centralised and Distributed Reinforcement Learning-Based Control for Soft Robotic Arms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02192v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a quantitative comparison between centralised and distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) architectures for controlling a soft robotic arm modelled as a Cosserat rod in simulation. Using PyElastica and the OpenAI Gym interface, we train both a global Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) controller and a Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) under identical budgets. Both approaches are based on the arm having $n$ number of controlled sections. The study systematically varies $n$ and evaluates the performance of the arm to reach a fixed target in three scenarios: default baseline condition, recovery from external disturbance, and adaptation to actuator failure. Quantitative metrics used for the evaluation are mean action magnitude, mean final distance, mean episode length, and success rate. The results show that there are no significant benefits of the distributed policy when the number of controlled sections $n\le4$. In very simple systems, when $n\le2$, the centralised policy outperforms the distributed one. When $n$ increases to $4< n\le 12$, the distributed policy shows a high sample efficiency. In these systems, distributed policy promotes a stronger success rate, resilience, and robustness under local observability and yields faster convergence given the same sample size. However, centralised policies achieve much higher time efficiency during training as it takes much less time to train the same size of samples. These findings highlight the trade-offs between centralised and distributed policy in reinforcement learning-based control for soft robotic systems and provide actionable design guidance for future sim-to-real transfer in soft rod-like manipulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, submitted to RoboSoft 2026</p></details> |
| **[Kinematic and Ergonomic Design of a Robotic Arm for Precision Laparoscopic Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02167v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic assistance in minimally invasive surgery can greatly enhance surgical precision and reduce surgeon fatigue. This paper presents a focused investigation on the kinematic and ergonomic design principles for a laparoscopic surgical robotic arm aimed at high-precision tasks. We propose a 7-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) robotic arm system that incorporates a remote center of motion (RCM) at the instrument insertion point and ergonomic considerations to improve surgeon interaction. The design is implemented on a general-purpose robotic platform, and a series of simulated surgical tasks were performed to evaluate targeting accuracy, task efficiency, and surgeon comfort compared to conventional manual laparoscopy. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized robotic design achieves significantly improved targeting accuracy (error reduced by over 50%) and shorter task completion times, while substantially lowering operator muscle strain and discomfort. These findings validate the importance of kinematic optimization (such as added articulations and tremor filtering) and human-centered ergonomic design in enhancing the performance of robot-assisted surgery. The insights from this work can guide the development of next-generation surgical robots that improve surgical outcomes and ergonomics for the operating team.</p></details> |  |
| **[Census-Based Population Autonomy For Distributed Robotic Teaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02147v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborating teams of robots show promise due in their ability to complete missions more efficiently and with improved robustness, attributes that are particularly useful for systems operating in marine environments. A key issue is how to model, analyze, and design these multi-robot systems to realize the full benefits of collaboration, a challenging task since the domain of multi-robot autonomy encompasses both collective and individual behaviors. This paper introduces a layered model of multi-robot autonomy that uses the principle of census, or a weighted count of the inputs from neighbors, for collective decision-making about teaming, coupled with multi-objective behavior optimization for individual decision-making about actions. The census component is expressed as a nonlinear opinion dynamics model and the multi-objective behavior optimization is accomplished using interval programming. This model can be reduced to recover foundational algorithms in distributed optimization and control, while the full model enables new types of collective behaviors that are useful in real-world scenarios. To illustrate these points, a new method for distributed optimization of subgroup allocation is introduced where robots use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize portions of the cost functions that are locally known, while being influenced by the opinion states from neighbors to account for the unobserved costs. With this method the group can collectively use the information contained in the Hessian matrix of the total global cost. The utility of this model is experimentally validated in three categorically different experiments with fleets of autonomous surface vehicles: an adaptive sampling scenario, a high value unit protection scenario, and a competitive game of capture the flag.</p></details> | 16 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Integrated Shape-Force Estimation for Continuum Robots: A Virtual-Work and Polynomial-Curvature Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05418v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cable-driven continuum robots (CDCRs) are widely used in surgical and inspection tasks that require dexterous manipulation in confined spaces. Existing model-based estimation methods either assume constant curvature or rely on geometry-space interpolants, both of which struggle with accuracy under large deformations and sparse sensing. This letter introduces an integrated shape-force estimation framework that combines cable-tension measurements with tip-pose data to reconstruct backbone shape and estimate external tip force simultaneously. The framework employs polynomial curvature kinematics (PCK) and a virtual-work-based static formulation expressed directly in curvature space, where polynomial modal coefficients serve as generalized coordinates. The proposed method is validated through Cosserat-rod-based simulations and hardware experiments on a torque-cell-enabled CDCR prototype. Results show that the second-order PCK model achieves superior shape and force accuracy, combining a lightweight shape optimization with a closed-form, iteration-free force estimation, offering a compact and robust alternative to prior constant-curvature and geometry-space approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robotic Monitoring of Colorimetric Leaf Sensors for Precision Agriculture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13916v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Common remote sensing modalities (RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral imaging or LiDAR) are often used to indirectly measure crop health and do not directly capture plant stress indicators. Commercially available direct leaf sensors are bulky, powered electronics that are expensive and interfere with crop growth. In contrast, low-cost, passive and bio-degradable leaf sensors offer an opportunity to advance real-time monitoring as they directly interface with the crop surface while not interfering with crop growth. To this end, we co-design a sensor-detector system, where the sensor is a passive colorimetric leaf sensor that directly measures crop health in a precision agriculture setting, and the detector autonomously obtains optical signals from these leaf sensors. The detector comprises a low size weight and power (SWaP) mobile ground robot with an onboard monocular RGB camera and object detector to localize each leaf sensor, as well as a hyperspectral camera with a motorized mirror and halogen light to acquire hyperspectral images. The sensor's crop health-dependent optical signals can be extracted from the hyperspectral images. The proof-of-concept system is demonstrated in row-crop environments both indoors and outdoors where it is able to autonomously navigate, locate and obtain a hyperspectral image of all leaf sensors present, and acquire interpretable spectral resonance with 80 $\%$ accuracy within a required retrieval distance from the sensor.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version.

By leveraging an existing CSI dataset, our approach integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to form a Hybrid Neural Network (HyNN) that estimates 2D robot positions. CSI readings are converted into synthetic images using the TINTO tool. The localisation solution is integrated with a robotics simulator, and the Robot Operating System (ROS), which facilitates its evaluation through heterogeneous test cases, and the adoption of state estimators like Kalman filters. Our contributions illustrate the potential of our HyNN model in achieving precise indoor localisation and navigation for mobile robots in complex environments. The study follows, and proposes, a generalisable procedure applicable beyond the specific use case studied, making it adaptable to different scenarios and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Kinematically Controllable Cable Robots with Reconfigurable End-effectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22825v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enlarge the translational workspace of cable-driven robots, one common approach is to increase the number of cables. However, this introduces two challenges: (1) cable interference significantly reduces the rotational workspace, and (2) the solution of tensions in cables becomes non-unique, resulting in difficulties for kinematic control of the robot. In this work, we design structurally simple reconfigurable end-effectors for cable robots. By incorporating a spring, a helical-grooved shaft, and a matching nut, relative linear motions between end-effector components are converted into relative rotations, thereby expanding the rotational workspace of the mechanism. Meanwhile, a bearing is introduced to provide an additional rotational degree of freedom, making the mechanism non-redundant. As a result, the robot's motion can be controlled purely through kinematics without additional tension sensing and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, Technical Report</p></details> |

MOBIUS features four limbs--two 6-DoF arms with two-finger grippers for manipulation and climbing, and two 4-DoF legs for locomotion--enabling smooth transitions across diverse terrains without reconfiguration. A hybrid control architecture combines reinforcement learning-based locomotion with model-based predictive and admittance control enhanced for safety by a Reference Governor toward compliant contact interactions. A high-level MIQCP planner autonomously selects locomotion modes to balance stability and energy efficiency. Hardware experiments demonstrate robust gait transitions, dynamic climbing, and full-body load support via pinch grasp. Overall, MOBIUS demonstrates the importance of tight integration between morphology, high-level planning, and control to enable mobile loco-manipulation and grasping, substantially expanding its interaction capabilities, workspace, and traversability.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 20 figures.

| **[Lightweight Learning from Actuation-Space Demonstrations via Flow Matching for Whole-Body Soft Robotic Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01770v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic grasping under uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge due to its uncertain and contact-rich nature. Traditional rigid robotic hands, with limited degrees of freedom and compliance, rely on complex model-based and heavy feedback controllers to manage such interactions. Soft robots, by contrast, exhibit embodied mechanical intelligence: their underactuated structures and passive flexibility of their whole body, naturally accommodate uncertain contacts and enable adaptive behaviors. To harness this capability, we propose a lightweight actuation-space learning framework that infers distributional control representations for whole-body soft robotic grasping, directly from deterministic demonstrations using a flow matching model (Rectified Flow),without requiring dense sensing or heavy control loops. Using only 30 demonstrations (less than 8% of the reachable workspace), the learned policy achieves a 97.5% grasp success rate across the whole workspace, generalizes to grasped-object size variations of +-33%, and maintains stable performance when the robot's dynamic response is directly adjusted by scaling the execution time from 20% to 200%. These results demonstrate that actuation-space learning, by leveraging its passive redundant DOFs and flexibility, converts the body's mechanics into functional control intelligence and substantially reduces the burden on central controllers for this uncertain-rich task.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating these policies directly on physical robotic platforms such as the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) remains hindered by high costs, time demands, reproducibility challenges, and variability in execution. World foundation models (WFM) for physical AI offer a transformative approach to simulate complex real-world surgical tasks, such as soft tissue deformation, with high fidelity. This work introduces Cosmos-Surg-dVRK, a surgical finetune of the Cosmos WFM, which, together with a trained video classifier, enables fully automated online evaluation and benchmarking of surgical policies. We evaluate Cosmos-Surg-dVRK using two distinct surgical datasets. On tabletop suture pad tasks, the automated pipeline achieves strong correlation between online rollouts in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK and policy outcomes on the real dVRK Si platform, as well as good agreement between human labelers and the V-JEPA 2-derived video classifier. Additionally, preliminary experiments with ex-vivo porcine cholecystectomy tasks in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK demonstrate promising alignment with real-world evaluations, highlighting the platform's potential for more complex surgical procedures.</p></details> | <details><summary>minor...</summary><p>minor metadata and notation fixes; +3 citations</p></details> |

Exploring the Role of Robots' Value Awareness in a Decision-Making Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23204v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates whether the opinions of robotic agents can influence human decision-making when robots display value awareness (i.e., the capability of understanding human preferences and prioritizing them in decision-making). We designed an experiment in which participants interacted with two Furhat robots - one programmed to be Value-Aware and the other Non-Value-Aware - during a labeling task for images representing human values. Results indicate that participants distinguished the Value-Aware robot from the Non-Value-Aware one. Although their explicit choices did not indicate a clear preference for one robot over the other, participants directed their gaze more toward the Value-Aware robot. Additionally, the Value-Aware robot was perceived as more loyal, suggesting that value awareness in a social robot may enhance its perceived commitment to the group. Finally, when both robots disagreed with the participant, conformity occurred in about one out of four trials, and participants took longer to confirm their responses, suggesting that two robots expressing dissent may introduce hesitation in decision-making. On one hand, this highlights the potential risk that robots, if misused, could manipulate users for unethical purposes. On the other hand, it reinforces the idea that social robots could encourage reflection in ambiguous situations and help users avoid scams.</p></details> | Pre-print version |

We present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on diffusion visuomotor policies trained by supervised learning. RL-100 introduces a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors. Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement. Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control, such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100 attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900 episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to two hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://lei-kun.github.io/RL-100/</p></details> |

We introduce MARS - a Multi-Agent Robotic System powered by MLLMs for assistive intelligence and designed for smart home robots supporting people with disabilities. The system integrates four agents: a visual perception agent for extracting semantic and spatial features from environment images, a risk assessment agent for identifying and prioritizing hazards, a planning agent for generating executable action sequences, and an evaluation agent for iterative optimization. By combining multimodal perception with hierarchical multi-agent decision-making, the framework enables adaptive, risk-aware, and personalized assistance in dynamic indoor environments. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior overall performance of the proposed system in risk-aware planning and coordinated multi-agent execution compared with state-of-the-art multimodal models. The proposed approach also highlights the potential of collaborative AI for practical assistive scenarios and provides a generalizable methodology for deploying MLLM-enabled multi-agent systems in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 fig...</summary><p>3 figures, 1 table; under review at Multimedia Systems (Springer)</p></details> |
| **[SE(3)-PoseFlow: Estimating 6D Pose Distributions for Uncertainty-Aware Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01501v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation is a fundamental problem in robotics and computer vision, yet it remains challenging due to partial observability, occlusions, and object symmetries, which inevitably lead to pose ambiguity and multiple hypotheses consistent with the same observation. While deterministic deep networks achieve impressive performance under well-constrained conditions, they are often overconfident and fail to capture the multi-modality of the underlying pose distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel probabilistic framework that leverages flow matching on the SE(3) manifold for estimating 6D object pose distributions. Unlike existing methods that regress a single deterministic output, our approach models the full pose distribution with a sample-based estimate and enables reasoning about uncertainty in ambiguous cases such as symmetric objects or severe occlusions. We achieve state-of-the-art results on Real275, YCB-V, and LM-O, and demonstrate how our sample-based pose estimates can be leveraged in downstream robotic manipulation tasks such as active perception for disambiguating uncertain viewpoints or guiding grasp synthesis in an uncertainty-aware manner.</p></details> |  |
